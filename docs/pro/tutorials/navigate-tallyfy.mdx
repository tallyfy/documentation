The search bar is located at the top of the screen. You can use it to search for processes, templates, tasks, or members within your organization. Simply type in the keyword you're looking for, and Tallyfy will display the relevant results.

Any result you get from it, will be separated by Templates, Processes, Tasks, and Snippets. This way, you can easily find what you're looking for.
