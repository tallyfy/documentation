## Tutorial: Create an automation by example

## General concepts

1. You can set IF conditions that listen to *tasks being completed*
2. You can set IF conditions that respond to the value of *specific form fields*
3. You can set IF conditions that respond to other criteria.
4. You can set IF conditions on a step of type "Approve/Reject" to listen for *an approve or reject* and fire off THEN automations on the back of that.

For example, if you're onboarding a new client, you can have different steps depending on the size of their company. Less than 20 employees? One path. 20 or more employees? A different path. You set and forget these paths so that people don't need to worry that they've missed something they should have done.

## Form-field example

Now, let's dive into a **form field** walk-through to see how it works in action. Imagine you're onboarding a new employee and you want to tailor their orientation process based on their role.

Here's how you can set it up:

1. Create a template for your process like "Employee Onboarding" and define the steps in your procedure. In this case, we'll have Step 1 for sharing employee details and Steps 2 and 3 for scheduling training or orientation.
2. Add a form field in Step 1 for capturing the employee's role, using radio buttons with options for "field worker" and "office worker".

3. Apply rules to Steps 2 and 3 based on the form field response. For example, if the employee is a field worker, only Step 2 (field training) should be shown. If they're an office worker, only Step 3 (office orientation) should be shown.

4. Launch your process and let Tallyfy run the automations like magic!

Once the process is launched:

* Only Step 1 will be assigned and visible at first.
* After the employee selects their role in Step 1, the relevant step (2 or 3) will be assigned and shown. The assigned person(s) will be notified accordingly.
* The assignee(s) can simply click on the task link in their email to complete the assigned step.
