## Tutorial: Create a template

Let's start simple by learning how to create a template using the side bar.

1. First, click on the **"Create"** button at the top of the left side bar.

3. You'll encounter a menu that offers the option to create a template either from scratch or by using Tallyfy AI. Opting for the **From scratch** choice requires you to manually specify each step. On the other hand, choosing **Tallyfy AI** will automatically generate a generic template for the process you need. Let's go with the **'Tallyfy AI** option and customize the details afterwards. Let's create a 'Client Onboarding' process for an accounting company. Change things to suit your needs!

4. We will receive a set of automatically generated steps, allowing us to delete any unnecessary steps or modify them later in the template editor. Feel free to regenerate the template as many times as needed until you find the one that best suits your requirements. Once you're satisfied with the result, click on **Continue** to create your template.

5. That's it! You have created your first template. You'll get redirected to the template editor - where you can edit any step you like, add new ones, and even [launch your first process](/products/pro/tutorials/your-first-process/)
