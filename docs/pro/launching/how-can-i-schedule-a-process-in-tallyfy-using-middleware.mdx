## How to schedule a process to launch automatically on a recurring schedule

Here's a simple guide to help you get started using Zapier as an example platform. The process is similar for Microsoft Power Automate and other middleware platforms, so feel free to adapt the steps accordingly.

1. Select the "schedule" trigger in Zapier
