## How to export any process to a CSV

Are you looking to export your Tallyfy processes into a convenient CSV format? Look no further - we've got you covered!

CSV files are a great way to organize and analyze your process data. They contain columns and rows that store important information about tasks and their details. You can easily view, sort, and aggregate data in this format. Plus, you'll find some extra useful details like hidden tasks, form field types (short text, long text, dropdown, checklist, radio button, date, file upload), form field questions, and their corresponding answers.
