## How to check the activity in a process

You can now easily track all activities on your processes with Tallyfy's 'Activity' stream feature. This allows you to view a detailed log of actions performed on a process, such as creating tasks, updating deadlines, completing tasks, re-opening tasks, and more. You can even see when processes are archived or unarchived.

To view the activity trail:

1. Choose your process from the 'Tracker'.
2. Click on 'Settings' and access the 'Activity' tab.
3. Scroll through the log to view the trail.

Please note that only Admins and members with access permission can view the Activity Trail.
