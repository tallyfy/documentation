## Tallyfy's Slack plugin

Slack is great for chat. However, the two biggest challenges people have with "just chat" is that you need to move a conversation or idea into action - and tracking actions with accountability is what Tallyfy does best.

Often - you need to create an actual task or launch a process with tasks in order to ensure that everything doesn't slip away in a giant ocean of chat. That's where Tallyfy is a very valuable add-on to your Slack!

## How to install and use our Slack plugin

To install the Tallyfy plugin for Slack, simply click the button on our [integrations page](https://tallyfy.com/integrations) or visit the [Slack app store](https://slack.com/apps/AF15436JJ-tallyfy).
