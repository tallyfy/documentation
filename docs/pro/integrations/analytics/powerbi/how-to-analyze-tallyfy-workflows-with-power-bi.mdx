## How to analyze Tallyfy data using Power BI

Tallyfy Analytics seamlessly integrates with popular BI and analytics tools like Power BI, giving you the freedom to analyze your data and make data-driven decisions.

## Connecting Power BI to Amazon Athena

Amazon offers a couple of ways to connect to their internal resources:

* IAM username and password
* Token-based authentication i.e. an Access Key

The first and most important point about integrating to PowerBI is that unlike Tableau and other BI tools - we've found that it's a lot easier to use token-based authentication for this purpose. If you try connecting with the IAM method to Amazon Athena from Power BI via ODBC - you get an error like this quite often:

> The security token included in the request is invalid

Tallyfy will create and provision the token-based credentials you need as part of the provisioning process for Tallyfy Analytics.

## Token-based connection to AWS Athena

You will be given the following from Tallyfy **as a substitute** for your IAM username and password:

* Access key
* Secret access key

In general - regular IAM user credentials (username + password) should be used only to access resources via AWS console - https://aws.amazon.com/

For all other integrations (like this ODBC driver) the external service access keys should be used.

## Connection

This section may not apply to you - but it's been left here as a general guide for those that might need it.

To connect Power BI to your data in Amazon Athena via IAM, you'll need to follow a few simple steps. Don't worry, we'll guide you through the process.

1. Install the Amazon Athena ODBC Driver

Start by downloading and installing the Amazon Athena ODBC Driver for your operating system. You can find the appropriate version on this [page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/connect-with-odbc.html).

2. Configure the ODBC Driver

Next, configure the ODBC driver according to your operating system.  Remember to include the authentication credentials provided by Tallyfy.

2. Connect Power BI to Amazon Athena

Watch our video tutorial to learn how to connect Power BI to Amazon Athena using the ODBC connector.

- Open Power BI Desktop and click on "Get Data."
- Select the "Other" category and choose ODBC, then click Connect.
- Pick the Data Source Name you set up during the configuration process and click OK.
- On the left panel, open the catalog and database, and select your desired table.
- Preview the data to ensure it's what you need.
- Finally, click Load to bring your Tallyfy data into Microsoft Power BI.

## Important points

* When you connect - please be sure to connect to region us-west-2
* Make sure your workground is the same as your orgID
* The "Catalog" is "AwsDataCatalog"
