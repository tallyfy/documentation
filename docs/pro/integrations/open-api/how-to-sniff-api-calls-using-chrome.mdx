## How to emulate client calls using Chrome's developer tools

Looking through our API documentation can be helpful, but sometimes you need more guidance on making API calls. Luckily, you can easily "sniff" or emulate client calls using Chrome's developer tools to see how the call was made and what the output was.

Important - if you make API calls directly to the Tallyfy API endpoint, you must supply an additional header in your requests `X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient` otherwise your requests will be dropped.

## Common Issues

## Using the raw source

When copying and pasting a payload from Chrome, make sure to copy the raw source instead of the parsed version. This ensures that you get the payload in the correct JSON format.

Here's how to copy the request payload properly:

1. Click on the "view source" tab.
2. Copy the raw/source body.

## Sending JSON, not text

Make sure to send your payload in JSON format, not as plain text. Selecting the "Text" option is incorrect.
