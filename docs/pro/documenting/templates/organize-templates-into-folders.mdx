## How to organize templates into folders

Today, we're going to talk about organizing your templates into folders. üìÅ

Are you tired of scrolling through tons of templates? We've got you covered! With folders, you can easily sort and group your templates, making them super easy to find. Plus, you can even sort them and favorite your most used ones for quick access.

## Create folders for your Templates

To create a folder, head over to the Templates section and click on the "New Folder" button. You will be prompted to name your folder.

## Unarchive templates

Did you accidentally archive a template? No worries! When you "unarchive" it, you'll find it right back in its original folder. Phew, crisis averted! üôå
