## How to add a description to a template

:::note[Changes made won't affect ongoing processes]

Note that any change you make to a template won't affect any ongoing process that depends on it. When you make changes to a template - it only affects the next process that launches from that template. This ensures the integrity and consistency of processes that were already launched in the past.

:::

To add a description to any template - select the _Edit_ view within the template editor, and click on the step you want to edit. Look for the _Description_ drawer.

If it's a procedure template - you would need to click on a step in order to edit the description. If it's a document template - you will see the entire document template immediately in the _Edit_ mode of the template editor.

You'll see a description text box on the menu, so just type in your new description. We save your changes in the background.

:::caution[Pasting content from web applications will result in changes to the content]

If you try to copy/paste content from apps like Microsoft Word or Google Docs into the [ rich text editor ](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/edit-task/how-can-i-use-tallyfys-rich-text-editor-for-tasks/), the formatting may not be preserved. This is because our rich editor does not inherit styling settings from the original app you pasted the content from.
