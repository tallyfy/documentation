## Everything about conditionals (IF) in Tallyfy Automations

Focus on what matters with Tallyfy automations! Let them handle the repetitive tasks by automatically making decisions based on your defined conditions. This detailed explanation will show you how to create powerful automations that save you time and effort, like automatically sending reminders when tasks are overdue or routing approvals based on specific criteria.

## Conditionals on Step types

The options for conditionals vary depending on the step type:

- If the step is of type "Step". You'll get the **Is completed** conditional, meaning you can get something done when a step or a series of steps are completed.

- If the step is of type "Approve/reject". You'll get the **Is rejected** and **Is approved** conditionals. This allows you to get something done if a task or a series of tasks get approved or rejected.

- If the step is of type "Expiry". You'll get the **Is acknowledged** and **Is expired** conditionals. Allowing you to do something if a step of this type gets completed in time or not.

## Conditionals on Field Types

Just like with step types, you have access to multiple options for conditionals that vary on the field type:

- Text or File upload: You'll get the **Contains**, **Does not contain**, **Is empty**, and **Is not empty** conditionals. They allow you to dynamically scan your field, and make decisions based on the content of your field.

- Table: You'll get the **Contains** conditional. Which will allow you to scan for a specific value on a specific column you choose.

- Checklist: You'll get the **Is**, **Is not**, **Contains**, **Does not contain**, **Is any of** conditionals. This allows you to automate decisions based on which elements were checked on the list.

- Dropdown: You'll get the **Is**, **Is not**, **Contains**, **Does not contain**, **Is any of**, **Is greater than**, and **Is less than** Conditionals. They will allow you to automate actions in your process based on a certain value obtained in the dropdown field

:::note[Adding multiple conditionals]

You can add as many conditionals as you want for an action to take place. This means that you can make multiple combinations of ANDs & ORs to your automation, as well as multiple actions once the conditionals are met.
