There are three ways to create a template in Tallyfy:

## Create a template from scratch

Creating a template from scratch means that you will start with a blank canvas and build your process from the ground up. This is a great option if you have a unique process that you want to document and automate. To start creating a template from scratch, simply select the **From scratch** option and give your new template a name. You will then be redirected to the template editor where you can start building your process the way you want it.
