## How to assign a task to a guest

To assign a guest user to a specific step in a template, head to the _Assign_ tab. You can either select "Guest" as the assignment type or enter the guest's email address in the assignee's textbox. This way, every task in the process will be assigned to the same guest.

Once you launch the template, you'll be prompted to enter the guest's email for that step.

## Assigning tasks to guests after launching a process

If you prefer, you can also assign tasks to a guest after you've launched the process. Just follow the steps below:

1. Go to the task you want to assign.
2. Click on the assignee dropdown and select "Guest".
3. Enter the guest's email address.

Your guest will receive an email with their task. They can easily access it by clicking on the task link provided in the email. Don't worry, your internal processes remain separate and secure!

## Assign guests by commenting on a task

You can also assign a task to a guest by commenting on the task. Simply type in the comments section the guest's email address with a '+' sign at the beggining. This will look something like this:

```
+guestemail@domain.com

```

The guest will receive an email notification with the task details.

Once the guest completes their task, it will be marked as "Completed" in your Tallyfy interface. Plus, if the guest accidentally loses the email or deletes it, you can always access the guest link to view or share the task details.

To view all tasks assigned to guests, simply go to the task view. In our PRO plans, guests can access a convenient multitask view where they can see all their tasks at once.

Managing tasks with guest users has never been easier. Try it out and streamline your processes with Tallyfy!
