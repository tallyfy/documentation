## Create a collection

Before we can add objects to Answers, we need to first create a `Collection` - we give it a name, then Answers will automatically detect your properties and data types based on the objects you index.


## Available data types

<table>
	<thead>
	<tr>
		<th width="25%"></th>
		<th width="30%"></th>
	</tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
	<tr>
		<td><b>Data Type</b></td>
		<td>Example</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>string</td>
		<td>string</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>list of strings</td>
		<td>["string one", "string two"]</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody>
</table>
