## Index a single object


If you need to index an object in response to some user action in your application, you can use the single object create endpoint.

If you need to index multiple objects at a time, we highly recommend using the import objects endpoint, which is optimized for bulk imports. For eg: If you have 100 objects, indexing them using the import endpoint at once will be much more performant than indexing objects one a time.

Let's see how we can add a new object to a collection.
