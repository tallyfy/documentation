## How do you find similar objects in Tallyfy Answers?

The recommendation endpoint allows you to discover objects similar to a specified reference object.

This similarity search uses vector embeddings to find objects with related characteristics, which is useful for recommendation systems, content discovery, and finding related items.

### How does similarity search work in Tallyfy Answers?

Tallyfy Answers uses semantic similarity to find related objects through this process:

1. Each object's text content is converted into vector embeddings (numerical representations)
2. When searching for similar objects, Tallyfy compares vector distances
3. Objects with closer vector distances are considered more similar
4. Results are ranked by similarity score from most to least similar

### API endpoint

  }
}
```

### Response fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `results` | array | List of similar objects with similarity scores |
| `results[].id` | string | Unique identifier of the similar object |
| `results[].score` | float | Similarity score (0.0-1.0)[^2] where higher is more similar |
| `results[].document` | object | Full content of the similar object |
| `meta.limit` | integer | Maximum number of results requested |
| `meta.found` | integer | Total number of similar objects found |

### Error scenarios

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 404 | Collection or reference object not found |
| 400 | Invalid parameters or filter syntax |

### Example request

  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key"
```

### What are common use cases for similarity search?

- **Product recommendations**: "Customers who viewed this also viewed..."
- **Content discovery**: Finding related articles or documentation
- **Similarity matching**: Identifying near-duplicate content
- **Alternative suggestions**: Offering similar options when an item is unavailable

### What are best practices for similarity search?

- Start with a lower `min_score` threshold and adjust based on result quality
- Use the `filter` parameter to combine similarity with business rules
- For better recommendations, ensure your objects contain rich, descriptive text
- Include diverse object attributes to improve similarity matching accuracy
