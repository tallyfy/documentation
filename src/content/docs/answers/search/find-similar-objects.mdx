## Finding similar objects through recommendations

The recommendation endpoint allows you to discover objects similar to a specified reference object. This similarity search uses vector embeddings to find objects with related characteristics, which is useful for recommendation systems, content discovery, and finding related items.

### How similarity search works

Tallyfy Answers uses semantic similarity to find related objects:

1. Each object's text content is converted into vector embeddings (numerical representations)
2. When searching for similar objects, the system compares vector distances
3. Objects with closer vector distances are considered more similar
4. Results are ranked by similarity score from most to least similar

### API endpoint

```
GET /v1/collections/{collection_name}/objects/{object_id}/similar
```

### Path parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `collection_name` | string | Yes | Name of the collection to search in |
| `object_id` | string | Yes | ID of the reference object to find similar objects to |

### Query parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `limit` | integer | No | 10 | Maximum number of similar objects to return (1-100) |
| `min_score` | float | No | 0.0 | Minimum similarity score threshold (0.0-1.0) |
| `filter` | string | No | null | Filter expression to narrow down results |

### Response

A successful request returns a `200 OK` status code and a JSON response containing:

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "product-456",
      "score": 0.89,
      "document": {
        "name": "Bluetooth Speaker",
        "description": "Portable waterproof speaker with 20-hour battery life",
        "price": 129.99,
        "categories": ["electronics", "audio"]
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "product-789",
      "score": 0.72,
      "document": {
        "name": "Wireless Earbuds",
        "description": "Premium noise-canceling earbuds with charging case",
        "price": 99.99,
        "categories": ["electronics", "audio"]
      }
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "limit": 10,
    "found": 2
  }
}
```

### Response fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `results` | array | List of similar objects with similarity scores |
| `results[].id` | string | Unique identifier of the similar object |
| `results[].score` | float | Similarity score (0.0-1.0) where higher is more similar |
| `results[].document` | object | Full content of the similar object |
| `meta.limit` | integer | Maximum number of results requested |
| `meta.found` | integer | Total number of similar objects found |

### Error scenarios

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 404 | Collection or reference object not found |
| 400 | Invalid parameters or filter syntax |

### Example request

```bash
# Find objects similar to product-123 with at least 0.7 similarity
curl -X GET "https://go.tallyfy.com/api/v1/collections/products/objects/product-123/similar?limit=5&min_score=0.7" \
  -H "X-Answers-API-Key: <your_api_key>"
```

### Common use cases

- **Product recommendations**: "Customers who viewed this also viewed..."
- **Content discovery**: Finding related articles or documentation
- **Similarity matching**: Identifying near-duplicate content
- **Alternative suggestions**: Offering similar options when an item is unavailable

### Best practices

- Start with a lower `min_score` threshold and adjust based on result quality
- Use the `filter` parameter to combine similarity with business rules
- For better recommendations, ensure your objects contain rich, descriptive text
- Include diverse object attributes to improve similarity matching
