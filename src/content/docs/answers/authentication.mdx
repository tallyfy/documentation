## Authentication for Tallyfy Answers API

All API requests to Tallyfy Answers require authentication using an API key. This key validates your identity and permissions when accessing the API endpoints.

### API key header

Add the following header to all your API requests:

```
X-Answers-API-Key: your_api_key
```

Replace `your_api_key` with the actual API key provided to your account.

### Obtaining an API key

To get an API key:

1. Log in to your Tallyfy Answers account
2. Navigate to the **API Settings** section
3. Click **Generate API Key**
4. Copy the generated key for use in your applications

### API key security best practices

- Do not share your API key in public repositories or client-side code
- Store your API key in environment variables or secure configuration files
- Regenerate your API key if you suspect it has been compromised
- Use different API keys for development and production environments

### Example authenticated request

```bash
curl -X GET https://api.tallyfy.com/answers/collections/my_collection \
  -H "X-Answers-API-Key: your_api_key"
```

### Authentication errors

If you receive a `401 Unauthorized` response, check that:
- Your API key is valid and active
- You've correctly included the `X-Answers-API-Key` header
- Your account has the necessary permissions for the requested operation
