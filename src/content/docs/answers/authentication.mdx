## How does authentication work with Tallyfy Answers API?

All API requests to Tallyfy Answers require authentication using an API key. This API key validates your identity and permissions when accessing Tallyfy Answers endpoints.

Tallyfy uses a centralized identity and access management system[^1] at [account.tallyfy.com](https://account.tallyfy.com) for all products.

This system handles sign up, sign in, SSO, and account management functions like password recovery across all Tallyfy products.

If your account is a member of multiple organizations, you can easily switch between them.

Click your name/profile picture in the top-right corner and select "Switch organization" to access other roles and organizations associated with your account.

### What API key header is required?

Add the following header to all your Tallyfy Answers API requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer your_api_key
```

Replace `your_api_key` with the actual API key provided to your Tallyfy account.

### How do you obtain a Tallyfy Answers API key?

To get a Tallyfy Answers API key:

1. Log in to your Tallyfy Answers account
2. Navigate to the **API Settings** section
3. Click **Generate API Key**
4. Copy the generated key for use in your applications

### What are API key security best practices?

- Do not share your Tallyfy API key in public repositories or client-side code
- Store your API key in environment variables or secure configuration files
- Regenerate your API key if you suspect it has been compromised
- Use different API keys for development and production environments

### What does an authenticated request look like?

```bash
curl -X GET https://go.tallyfy.com/api/answers/collections/my_collection \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### How do you troubleshoot authentication errors?

If you receive a `401 Unauthorized[^2]` response, check that:
- Your Tallyfy Answers API key is valid and active
- You've correctly included the `Authorization: Bearer` header
- Your account has the necessary permissions for the requested operation
