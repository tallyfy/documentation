## Authentication with Tallyfy Answers

All API requests to Tallyfy Answers require authentication using an API key. This API key validates your identity and permissions when accessing Tallyfy Answers endpoints.

Tallyfy uses a centralized identity and access management system[^1] at [account.tallyfy.com](https://account.tallyfy.com) for all products.

This system handles sign up, sign in, SSO, and account management functions like password recovery across all Tallyfy products.

If your account is a member of multiple organizations, you can easily switch between them.

Click your name/profile picture in the top-right corner and select "Switch organization" to access other roles and organizations associated with your account.

### Required API key header

Add the following header to all your Tallyfy Answers API requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer your_api_key
```

Replace `your_api_key` with the actual API key provided to your Tallyfy account.

### Obtaining a Tallyfy Answers API key

To get a Tallyfy Answers API key:

1. Log in to your Tallyfy Answers account
2. Navigate to the **API Settings** section
3. Click **Generate API Key**
4. Copy the generated key for use in your applications

### API key security best practices

- Do not share your Tallyfy API key in public repositories or client-side code
- Store your API key in environment variables or secure configuration files
- Regenerate your API key if you suspect it has been compromised
- Use different API keys for development and production environments

### Example authenticated request

```bash
curl -X GET https://go.tallyfy.com/api/answers/collections/my_collection \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Troubleshooting authentication errors

If you receive a `401 Unauthorized[^2]` response, check that:
- Your Tallyfy Answers API key is valid and active
- You've correctly included the `Authorization: Bearer` header
- Your account has the necessary permissions for the requested operation
