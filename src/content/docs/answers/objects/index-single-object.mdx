description: A POST API endpoint that enables adding individual objects to collections
  with JSON formatting while handling errors and providing status responses through
  Tallyfy Answers platform.
title: Index a single object
---

## Indexing individual objects

This endpoint allows you to add a single object to a specific collection in Tallyfy Answers. Use this method when you need to index objects in response to real-time events or user actions in your application.

### When to use this endpoint

This endpoint is ideal for:
- Adding individual records as they're created
- Updating existing objects with new information
- Testing your integration with Tallyfy Answers
- Low-volume indexing operations

For high-volume operations, the [import objects endpoint](/products/answers/objects/index-multiple-objects/) offers significantly better performance.

### API endpoint

```
POST /v1/collections/{collection_name}/objects
```

### Request parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `collection_name` | path | Yes | Name of the collection where the object will be indexed |

### Request body

The request body should contain a JSON object with the data you want to index. For example:

```json
{
  "id": "product-123",
  "name": "Wireless Headphones",
  "description": "Premium noise-canceling headphones with 20-hour battery life",
  "price": 79.99,
  "categories": ["electronics", "audio", "wireless"]
}
```

### Response

A successful request returns a `201 Created` status code and a JSON response containing:

```json
{
  "id": "product-123",
  "status": "success"
}
```

### Error scenarios

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 400 | Malformed request or invalid object format |
| 404 | Collection not found |
| 409 | Object ID conflict (when using custom IDs) |
| 413 | Object size too large |

### Example request

```bash
curl -X POST https://go.tallyfy.com/api/v1/collections/products/objects \
  -H "X-Answers-API-Key: <your_api_key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "id": "product-123",
    "name": "Wireless Headphones",
    "price": 79.99,
    "categories": ["electronics", "audio"]
  }'
```

### Performance considerations

For indexing multiple objects, consider using the bulk import endpoint instead of making multiple individual requests. The bulk endpoint is optimized for higher throughput and will significantly reduce API request overhead.
