## Batch importing multiple objects

This endpoint allows you to efficiently index multiple objects into Tallyfy Answers in a single API call. It significantly outperforms making multiple individual object creation requests, especially for large datasets or initial data loading.

### API endpoint

```
POST /v1/collections/{collection_name}/objects/import
```

### Request parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `collection_name` | path | Yes | Name of the collection to import objects into |

### Request body format: JSONLines

The request body must use the [JSONLines format](https://jsonlines.org/) (also known as newline-delimited JSON). This format consists of multiple JSON objects, with each object on a separate line and no commas between objects.

Example JSONLines format for three objects:

```
{"id": "product-123", "name": "Wireless Headphones", "price": 79.99}
{"id": "product-456", "name": "Bluetooth Speaker", "price": 129.99}
{"id": "product-789", "name": "Smart Watch", "price": 199.99}
```

### Content-Type header

Set the `Content-Type` header to either:
- `application/x-ndjson` (preferred)
- `text/plain`

### Response

A successful request returns a `200 OK` status code and a summary of the import operation:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "count": 3,
  "errors": []
}
```

If some objects fail to import while others succeed, you'll receive a `207 Multi-Status` response:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "count": 2,
  "errors": [
    {
      "line": 2,
      "error": "Invalid object format at line 2",
      "object": "{malformed json}"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Error scenarios

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 400 | Invalid JSONLines format or request body |
| 404 | Collection not found |
| 413 | Request body too large |

### Example request using curl

```bash
curl -X POST https://go.tallyfy.com/api/collections/products/objects/import \
  -H "X-Answers-API-Key: <your_api_key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-ndjson" \
  --data-binary @products.ndjson
```

### Best practices for batch imports

- **Size limitations**: Keep individual requests under 5MB
- **Chunking**: For large datasets, break imports into smaller batches of 100-1000 objects
- **ID handling**: You can mix objects with and without custom IDs in the same import
- **Error handling**: Process the errors array in the response to identify and fix failed objects
- **Parallel imports**: For very large datasets, you can make multiple parallel import requests to different collections

### When to use batch import

- Initial data population
- Regular data synchronization from external systems
- Bulk updates to multiple objects
- Periodic content refreshes
