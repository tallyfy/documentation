## Index multiple objects

You can index multiple objects in a batch using the import API.

When indexing multiple objects, this endpoint is much more performant, than calling the single object create endpoint multiple times in quick succession.

The object to import need to be formatted as a newline delimited JSON string, aka JSONLines
(opens new window) format. This is essentially one JSON object per line, without commas between documents. For example, here are a set of 3 documents represented in JSONL format.

import { CardGrid, LinkTitleCard} from "~/components";
