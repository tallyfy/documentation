## Retrieving individual objects

This endpoint allows you to fetch a specific object from a collection using its unique identifier. Use this to access the complete data for an individual record.

### API endpoint

```
GET /v1/collections/{collection_name}/objects/{object_id}
```

### Request parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `collection_name` | path | Yes | Name of the collection containing the object |
| `object_id` | path | Yes | Unique identifier of the object to retrieve |

### Response

A successful request returns a `200 OK` status code and a JSON object containing all the properties of the requested object:

```json
{
  "id": "product-123",
  "name": "Wireless Headphones",
  "description": "Premium noise-canceling headphones with 20-hour battery life",
  "price": 79.99,
  "categories": ["electronics", "audio", "wireless"],
  "created_at": "2023-08-15T14:32:21Z",
  "updated_at": "2023-08-15T14:32:21Z"
}
```

### Error scenarios

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 404 | Object or collection not found |
| 400 | Invalid object ID format |

### Example request

```bash
curl -X GET https://go.tallyfy.com/api/v1/collections/products/objects/product-123 \
  -H "X-Answers-API-Key: your_api_key"
```

### Usage considerations

- Object retrieval is suitable for displaying detailed information about a specific item
- For searching across multiple objects, use the [search endpoint](/products/answers/search/) instead
- The API returns the complete object with all its properties
- System fields like `created_at` and `updated_at` are automatically included
