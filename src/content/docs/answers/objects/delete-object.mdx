## Deleting objects from collections

This endpoint allows you to permanently remove a specific object from a collection using its unique identifier. Once deleted, an object cannot be recovered.

### API endpoint

```
DELETE /v1/collections/{collection_name}/objects/{object_id}
```

### Request parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `collection_name` | path | Yes | Name of the collection containing the object |
| `object_id` | path | Yes | Unique identifier of the object to delete |

### Response

A successful deletion returns a `200 OK` status code with a confirmation response:

```json
{
  "id": "product-123",
  "status": "deleted"
}
```

### Error scenarios

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 404 | Object or collection not found |
| 400 | Invalid object ID format |
| 403 | Permission denied (if applicable) |

### Example request

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://api.tallyfy.com/v1/collections/products/objects/product-123 \
  -H "X-Answers-API-Key: your_api_key"
```

### Important considerations

:::warning[Permanent Action]
Object deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. There is no "trash" or "recycle bin" for deleted objects.
:::

- Verify that you have the correct object ID before deletion
- Consider archiving objects in your application logic instead of deleting them if you might need them later
- Deleting an object will remove it from search results immediately
- If you need to delete multiple objects, you may need to make separate API calls for each one
- Consider implementing confirmation workflows in your application before calling this endpoint

### Alternative approaches

Instead of actually deleting objects, consider these alternatives:
- Add a "status" field to mark objects as inactive
- Move objects to an "archive" collection
- Implement soft deletion by adding a "deleted_at" timestamp field
