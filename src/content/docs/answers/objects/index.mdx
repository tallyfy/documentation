## Objects

Every record you index in Answers called an `Object`.

If the object contains an id field of type string, Answers will use that field as the identifier for the document. Otherwise, Answers will assign an auto-generated identifier to the document. Since it's a special field, the id field is not required to be defined as part of the collection schema.
