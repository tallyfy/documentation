## Working with Objects in Tallyfy Answers

Objects are the fundamental data records in Tallyfy Answers. Each object represents a single item that can be indexed, retrieved, and searched within your collections.

### What is an object?

An object in Tallyfy Answers:
- Contains data in JSON format
- Belongs to a specific collection
- Has a unique identifier (either custom or auto-generated)
- Can store multiple properties and values
- Is fully searchable once indexed

### Object identifiers

Tallyfy Answers handles object IDs in two ways:

1. **Custom IDs**: If your object includes an `id` field of type string, Answers will use this as the identifier:
   ```json
   {
     "id": "product-123",
     "name": "Wireless Headphones",
     "price": 79.99
   }
   ```

2. **Auto-generated IDs**: If no `id` field is provided, Answers will automatically generate a unique identifier:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "Wireless Headphones",
     "price": 79.99
   }
   ```

The `id` field is special and doesn't need to be explicitly defined in your collection schema.

### Object structure flexibility

Unlike traditional databases, Tallyfy Answers doesn't require you to predefine a rigid schema before adding objects. The system automatically detects properties and data types as you index objects, providing flexibility as your data evolves.

### Common object operations

With Tallyfy Answers, you can:
- [Index a single object](/products/answers/objects/index-single-object/)
- [Index multiple objects in bulk](/products/answers/objects/index-multiple-objects/)
- [Retrieve specific objects](/products/answers/objects/get-object/)
- [Delete objects](/products/answers/objects/delete-object/)
- Search for objects within collections

### Best practices for objects

- Use consistent property names across similar objects
- Choose meaningful custom IDs when possible
- Structure nested data appropriately for searching
- Consider batching multiple objects for more efficient indexing
- Include all relevant data for search in your objects
