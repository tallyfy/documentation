## How do background tasks work in Tallyfy Answers?

Tallyfy Answers uses background task processing to handle long-running operations without blocking your API requests. This ensures that large batch imports and data processing jobs don't cause timeouts or performance issues.

### What are background tasks?

Background tasks in Tallyfy Answers handle:

- **Batch Document Imports** - Processing large collections of documents for indexing
- **Data Processing Jobs** - Converting and analyzing content for search optimization
- **Collection Updates** - Making bulk changes to existing data
- **Maintenance Operations** - System cleanup and optimization tasks

### How do you monitor running tasks?

View all currently running background tasks:

```bash
GET /tasks
```

**Example:**
```bash
curl "https://answers.tallyfy.com/tasks" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key"
```

### How do you cancel a running task?

Stop a specific background task by name:

```bash
DELETE /tasks/{task_name}
```

**Example:**
```bash
curl -X DELETE "https://answers.tallyfy.com/tasks/batch_import_docs" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key"
```

### What task information is available?

When you list running tasks, you'll see:

- **Task Name** - Unique identifier for the background operation
- **Status** - Current state of the task (running, queued, completed)
- **Progress** - How much of the task has been completed
- **Start Time** - When the task began processing
- **Estimated Completion** - Predicted time remaining

### When should you use task management?

Task management is useful for:

1. **Large Imports** - Monitor progress of bulk document uploads
2. **System Maintenance** - Check status of scheduled operations
3. **Troubleshooting** - Cancel stuck or problematic tasks
4. **Resource Management** - Prevent system overload by managing concurrent operations
5. **User Experience** - Provide progress updates for long-running operations

### What are best practices for task management?

- **Monitor Long Operations** - Check task status for imports over 1000 documents
- **Cancel Stuck Tasks** - Remove tasks that appear frozen or taking too long
- **Plan Large Imports** - Schedule big data loads during low-usage periods
- **Regular Cleanup** - Cancel completed or failed tasks to keep the queue clean
