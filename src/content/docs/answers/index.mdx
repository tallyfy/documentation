## A next-gen search experience

Tallyfy Answers is a complete, UI-ready, high-performance search product with all the following baked in to our stack:

* Indexing of documents into a vector database
* A UI for search results
* LLM (GPT) generated answers within search results - where appropriate

In the age of generative AI - we believe neural search should be part of the overall search experience, not an extra.

Tallyfy Answers could be a better, cheaper, more flexible alternative to other search vendors like Elasticsearch, Algolia, Typesense or Meilisearch.

:::note[Note]

While some users confuse Tallyfy Answers with search engines like Google or Bing, Tallyfy Answers differs significantly. Unlike traditional search engines that crawl data from websites, Answers allows you to push your existing data (JSON format) into Tallyfy Answers. This enables your users to search through the data using a search UI on your site or app.
