title: Overview

## A next-gen search experience

Tallyfy Answers is a complete, high-performance search product that integrates:

* Vector database indexing for documents
* User-friendly search interface
* LLM (GPT) generated responses within search results

Neural search is integrated into the overall search experience, not offered as a separate feature.

Tallyfy Answers provides an alternative to search vendors like Elasticsearch, Algolia, Typesense, and Meilisearch with enhanced capabilities at competitive pricing.

:::note[Important distinction]
Tallyfy Answers differs from traditional search engines like Google or Bing. Rather than crawling websites, Answers allows you to push your JSON-formatted data into the system. This enables your users to search through your specific data using a search interface on your site or app.
