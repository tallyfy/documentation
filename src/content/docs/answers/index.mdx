## What is Tallyfy Answers' next-generation search?

Tallyfy Answers is a complete, high-performance search solution that brings together:

* Vector database indexing for document storage and retrieval
* User-friendly search interface for easy navigation
* LLM (GPT) generated responses within search results for better answers

Neural search capabilities are built into the overall Tallyfy Answers search experience, not offered as a separate feature.

Tallyfy Answers gives you an alternative to traditional search vendors like Elasticsearch, Algolia, Typesense, and Meilisearch.

Tallyfy Answers offers better AI capabilities at competitive pricing.

:::note[Important distinction]
Tallyfy Answers differs from traditional search engines like Google or Bing in a key way.

Rather than crawling websites, Tallyfy Answers lets you push your JSON-formatted data into the system. This lets your users search through your specific data using a search interface on your site or app.
