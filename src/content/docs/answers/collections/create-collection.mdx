## Creating collections

Before adding objects to Tallyfy Answers, you must first create a collection. Each collection requires a unique name, and the system will automatically detect the data types of your objects as you index them.

### API endpoint

```
POST /v1/collections
```

### Request body

The request body should contain a JSON object with the following properties:

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Yes | Unique name for the collection (can include letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores) |
| `description` | string | No | Optional description explaining the collection's purpose |

Example request body:

```json
{
  "name": "products",
  "description": "Collection of product information including names, descriptions, and pricing"
}
```

### Response

A successful request returns a `201 Created` status code and a JSON response containing:

```json
{
  "name": "products",
  "description": "Collection of product information including names, descriptions, and pricing",
  "created_at": "2023-08-15T14:32:21Z"
}
```

### Error scenarios

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 400 | Invalid request format or collection name |
| 409 | Collection name already exists |

### Example request

```bash
curl -X POST https://go.tallyfy.com/api/v1/collections \
  -H "X-Answers-API-Key: <your_api_key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "products",
    "description": "Collection of product information"
  }'
```

### Supported data types

Tallyfy Answers automatically detects the following data types when you index objects:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th width="30%">Data Type</th>
      <th width="30%">Example</th>
      <th width="40%">Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>string</td>
      <td>"Wireless Headphones"</td>
      <td>Text values that can be searched and filtered</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>list of strings</td>
      <td>["electronics", "audio"]</td>
      <td>Arrays of text values for multi-value fields</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Collection naming best practices

- Use lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores
- Choose descriptive names that reflect the content (e.g., "products", "users", "articles")
- Avoid spaces and special characters
- Keep names concise but meaningful
- Use consistent naming conventions across collections
