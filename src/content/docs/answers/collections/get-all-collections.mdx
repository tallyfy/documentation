---

## Listing all collections

This endpoint retrieves a summary of all collections in your Tallyfy Answers account. Collections are sorted by creation date in descending order (newest first), making it easy to find recently created collections.

### API endpoint

```
GET /v1/collections
```

### Query parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `limit` | integer | No | 20 | Maximum number of collections to return (1-100) |
| `offset` | integer | No | 0 | Number of collections to skip (for pagination) |

### Response

A successful request returns a `200 OK` status code and a JSON response containing:

```json
{
  "collections": [
    {
      "name": "products",
      "description": "Collection of product information",
      "object_count": 142,
      "created_at": "2023-08-15T14:32:21Z"
    },
    {
      "name": "customers",
      "description": "Customer account information",
      "object_count": 1253,
      "created_at": "2023-07-28T09:15:33Z"
    }
  ],
  "meta": {
    "total_collections": 5,
    "limit": 20,
    "offset": 0
  }
}
```

### Response fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `collections` | array | List of collection summary objects |
| `meta.total_collections` | integer | Total number of collections in your account |
| `meta.limit` | integer | Limit value used in the request |
| `meta.offset` | integer | Offset value used in the request |

### Error scenarios

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 400 | Invalid query parameters |

### Example request

```bash
# Get first page of collections (default 20 per page)
curl -X GET https://api.tallyfy.com/v1/collections \
  -H "X-Answers-API-Key: your_api_key"

# Get second page with 10 collections per page
curl -X GET "https://api.tallyfy.com/v1/collections?limit=10&offset=10" \
  -H "X-Answers-API-Key: your_api_key"
```

### Pagination

To paginate through large numbers of collections:

1. Make an initial request with desired `limit`
2. Check the `meta.total_collections` value to determine total pages
3. Increase the `offset` parameter by the `limit` value for each subsequent page
4. Continue until you've processed all collections

Example pagination calculation:
- If you have 45 total collections with a limit of 10:
  - Page 1: offset=0, limit=10 (collections 1-10)
  - Page 2: offset=10, limit=10 (collections 11-20)
  - Page 3: offset=20, limit=10 (collections 21-30)
  - Page 4: offset=30, limit=10 (collections 31-40)
  - Page 5: offset=40, limit=10 (collections 41-45)

### Usage scenarios

- Displaying a list of collections in a management interface
- Generating reports on collection usage
- Performing operations across all collections
- Finding collections by name when browsing
