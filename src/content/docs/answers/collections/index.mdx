## Working with Collections in Tallyfy Answers

Collections in Tallyfy Answers are organizational structures that group similar objects together. Each collection functions like a table in a relational database, allowing objects to be compared, filtered, searched, and ranked.

### What is a collection?

A collection is:
- A logical container for related objects
- Similar to a table in a traditional database
- Designed for organizing data with similar structures
- Flexible enough to adapt as your data evolves

### Collection features

Collections in Tallyfy Answers offer several key features:

- **Dynamic schema detection**: The system automatically identifies data types from your objects
- **Efficient organization**: Group related objects to simplify management
- **Searchability**: Search across all objects within a collection
- **Scalability**: Collections can contain thousands of objects
- **Metadata**: Store and retrieve information about the collection itself

### Collection operations

### Best practices for collections

Consider these guidelines when working with collections:

- Group similar objects with consistent structures
- Create separate collections for significantly different data types
- Plan your collection structure before importing large datasets
- Use collection names that reflect the objects they contain
