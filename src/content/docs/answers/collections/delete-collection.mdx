DELETE /v1/collections/{collection_name}
```

### Path parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |

| `collection_name` | string | Yes | Name of the collection to delete |

### Response

A successful deletion returns a `200 OK` status code with a confirmation response:

  "status": "deleted"
}
```

### Error scenarios

### When to delete a collection

Consider deleting a collection when:
- The data is no longer needed for any purpose
- You need to rebuild a collection with a different structure
- You want to remove test or development data
- You're performing cleanup of unused resources

### Alternatives to deletion

Instead of permanently deleting a collection, consider these alternatives:
- Export the data before deletion for backup purposes
- Create a new collection with only the objects you want to keep
- Use application-level filtering to hide certain objects from users

### Best practices

- Always confirm collection names before deletion
- Consider implementing a confirmation step in your application
- Back up important data before deletion
- Use descriptive logging to track deletion operations
- Verify permissions carefully to prevent unauthorized deletions
