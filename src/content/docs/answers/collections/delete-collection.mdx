## Deleting collections

This endpoint allows you to permanently remove a collection and all its objects from Tallyfy Answers[^1]. This operation is irreversible and should be used with caution.

:::warning[Permanent Action]
Deleting a collection permanently removes all objects within it. This action cannot be undone, and there is no way to recover the data once deleted.
:::

### API endpoint

```
DELETE /v1/collections/{collection_name}
```

### Path parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `collection_name` | string | Yes | Name of the collection to delete |

### Response

A successful deletion returns a `200 OK` status code with a confirmation response:

```json
{
  "name": "products",
  "status": "deleted"
}
```

### Error scenarios

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 404 | Collection not found |

| 403 | Permission denied (if applicable) |

### Example request

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://go.tallyfy.com/api/collections/products \
  -H "X-Answers-API-Key: your_api_key"
```

### When to delete a collection

Consider deleting a collection when:
- The data is no longer needed for any purpose
- You need to rebuild a collection with a different structure
- You want to remove test or development data
- You're performing cleanup of unused resources

### Alternatives to deletion

Instead of permanently deleting a collection, consider these alternatives:
- Export the data before deletion for backup purposes
- Create a new collection with only the objects you want to keep
- Use application-level filtering[^2] to hide certain objects from users

### Best practices

- Always confirm collection names before deletion
- Consider implementing a confirmation step in your application
- Back up important data before deletion
- Use descriptive logging to track deletion operations
- Verify permissions carefully to prevent unauthorized deletions
