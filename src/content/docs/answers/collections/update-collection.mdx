## Updating collection properties

This endpoint allows you to modify certain properties of an existing collection in Tallyfy Answers, such as its description or configuration settings. The collection name cannot be changed once it's created.

### API endpoint

```
PATCH /v1/collections/{collection_name}
```

### Path parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `collection_name` | string | Yes | Name of the collection to update |

### Request body

The request body should contain a JSON object with the properties you want to update:

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `description` | string | No | New description for the collection |

Example request body:

```json
{
  "description": "Updated collection of premium electronics products"
}
```

### Response

A successful update returns a `200 OK` status code and a JSON response containing the updated collection:

```json
{
  "name": "products",
  "description": "Updated collection of premium electronics products",
  "schema": {
    "name": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "price": {
      "type": "number"
    },
    "categories": {
      "type": "string[]"
    }
  },
  "created_at": "2023-08-15T14:32:21Z",
  "updated_at": "2023-09-05T10:15:42Z"
}
```

### Error scenarios

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 404 | Collection not found |
| 400 | Invalid request format or parameters |

### Example request

```bash
curl -X PATCH https://go.tallyfy.com/api/collections/products \
  -H "X-Answers-API-Key: <your_api_key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "description": "Updated collection of premium electronics products"
  }'
```

### Common update scenarios

There are several situations where updating a collection is useful:

- **Improving documentation**: Add or update the description to better explain the collection's purpose
- **Adjusting configurations**: Modify search settings or other configuration parameters
- **Refining metadata**: Update metadata fields to provide better context for the collection

### Limitations

- The collection name cannot be changed after creation
- Schema changes happen automatically as objects are indexed, not through this endpoint
- Certain system-level properties cannot be modified

### Best practices

- Make incremental updates to avoid disrupting existing processes
- Use descriptive descriptions to help users understand the collection's purpose
- Document changes to collection properties for future reference
