## Overview

Tallyfy Denizen is a free API-driven service which takes in a city (optional) and a country (required) and returns a photo local to that place, sourced via royalty-free photo collections like Unsplash.

You don't need to supply any information - by default - Denizen uses the country and city we derive from your referring IP address.

## Use Cases

Tallyfy IAM (registering, signing up, etc.) uses Denizen to localize the photo on our new account registration page.

In A/B tests - a localized version of the page saw a 42% uplift in initial conversions and a 31% uplift in new trial users engaged for 1 week after signup.

Results can vary of course, but Denizen is totally free to use at any scale, and we suggest doing A/B tests to prove it works for your specific use case.

## Contributions and Questions

We eventually aim to open source all assets, etc. for Denizen.
