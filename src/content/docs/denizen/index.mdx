## What is Tallyfy Denizen?

Tallyfy Denizen is a free API service that gives you location-specific royalty-free photos based on city (optional) and country (required) parameters.

Photos come from collections like Unsplash.

Tallyfy Denizen automatically figures out location from the user's IP address, needing no manual input from end users.

Tallyfy uses a centralized identity and access management system at [account.tallyfy.com](https://account.tallyfy.com) for all products.

This system handles sign up, sign in, SSO, and account management functions like password recovery across all Tallyfy products.

If your account belongs to multiple organizations, you can easily switch between them.

Click your name/profile picture in the top-right corner and select "Switch organization" to access other roles and organizations connected to your account.

## How does Tallyfy Denizen work?

1. When a user visits your site, Tallyfy Denizen spots their location using their IP address
2. The service gets royalty-free images specific to that location
3. These images are sent through a simple API endpoint
