## What is Tallyfy Denizen

Tallyfy Denizen is a free API service that delivers location-specific royalty-free photos based on city (optional) and country (required) parameters. Photos are sourced from collections like Unsplash.

Denizen automatically determines location from the user's IP address, requiring no manual input from end users.

Tallyfy uses a centralized identity and access management system at [account.tallyfy.com](https://account.tallyfy.com) for all products. This system handles sign up, sign in, SSO, and account management functions like password recovery across all Tallyfy products.

## How Denizen Works

1. When a user visits your site, Denizen detects their location using their IP address
2. The service retrieves royalty-free images specific to that location
3. These images are delivered through a simple API endpoint

## Business Benefits and Use Cases

### Proven Results
Tallyfy uses Denizen on account registration pages with significant measurable impact:

* 42% increase in initial conversions
* 31% increase in trial user engagement (one week after signup)

### Implementation Suggestions
Results may vary based on your specific implementation. Since Denizen is free at any scale, we recommend:

* Conducting A/B tests for your specific use case
* Testing different page locations for the Denizen images
* Measuring impact on conversion and engagement metrics
