## Overview

Tallyfy Denizen is a free API service that delivers location-specific royalty-free photos based on city (optional) and country (required) parameters. Photos are sourced from collections like Unsplash.

By default, Denizen determines location from the user's IP address, requiring no manual input.

## Use Cases

Tallyfy uses Denizen to localize images on account registration pages. A/B testing showed:

* 42% increase in initial conversions
* 31% increase in trial user engagement (one week after signup)

Results vary by implementation. Since Denizen is free at any scale, we recommend conducting A/B tests for your specific use case.

We plan to open-source all Denizen assets in the future.
