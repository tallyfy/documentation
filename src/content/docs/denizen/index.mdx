## What is Tallyfy Denizen?

Tallyfy Denizen is a free API service that delivers location-specific royalty-free photos based on the user's geographic location. The service accepts city (optional) and country (required) parameters to return relevant images.

Photos are sourced from curated collections including Unsplash and other royalty-free image providers.

The service automatically detects location from the user's IP address - no manual input required from end users.

Tallyfy uses a centralized identity and access management system at [account.tallyfy.com](https://account.tallyfy.com) for all products.

This system handles sign up, sign in, SSO, and account management functions like password recovery across all Tallyfy products.

If your account belongs to multiple organizations, you can easily switch between them.

Click your name/profile picture in the top-right corner and select "Switch organization" to access other roles and organizations connected to your account.

## How does Tallyfy Denizen work?

1. When a user visits your site, Tallyfy Denizen detects their location using IP geolocation
2. The service retrieves royalty-free images specific to that location
3. Images are delivered through a simple RESTful API endpoint
