## API Endpoint Reference

### Base URL

```
https://denizen.tallyfy.com/
```

### How to Use

To implement Denizen in your application:

1. Make a GET request to the base URL
2. The service automatically detects user location via IP address
3. An image appropriate for the detected location is returned

### Response Types

When calling the Denizen API, you'll receive one of two responses:

* **Localized image** - An image that matches the user's detected location
* **Default image** - Served when location can't be determined or no specific images exist for that location

## Coverage Details

### Image Availability by Region

* **United States**: City-level images available (more granular)
* **Other countries**: Country-level images only (no city-specific images)

### Technical Implementation

Denizen is built for performance and reliability:

* Hosted on Cloudflare Pages for global distribution
* Designed to handle high traffic volumes with minimal latency
* No API key or authentication required
