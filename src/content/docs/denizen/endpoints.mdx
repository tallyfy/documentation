snippet: A location-based image service accessible through a base URL delivers location-specific
  photos using Cloudflare to determine user location and serves default images when
  location data is unavailable.

## Endpoints

The base URL is:

`https://denizen.tallyfy.com/`

All you have to do is hit that URL and you should get a response that's one of these two:

1. An image that's localized to your current reported location - we use Cloudflare to resolve IP to location.
2. A default image - if we don't know your location or haven't got images for it.

Note - US images are city level only at present, while other countries are country-level images that have no regard to the exact city, province or area.

Denizen should be able to scale and perform quickly with any amount of traffic because it's hosted on Cloudflare Pages

We'd love to hear about any interesting use cases or test results you encounter! Contact us at https://tallyfy.com/contact-us/
