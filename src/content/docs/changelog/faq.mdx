## Everything you need to know about Tallyfy Changelog

Have questions about how Tallyfy Changelog can transform your release communications? Here are the answers to what companies ask most often.

## General questions

### What exactly is Tallyfy Changelog?

Tallyfy Changelog is a managed service that automatically transforms your product development updates into professional, customer-friendly release notes. Instead of spending hours writing changelogs manually, you get polished announcements that customers actually want to read.

### How is this different from other changelog tools?

Most changelog tools just help you format and publish updates - you still have to write everything. Tallyfy Changelog actually creates the content for you, understanding which changes matter to customers and explaining them in clear, benefit-focused language.

Think of it this way: other tools give you a better typewriter. Tallyfy Changelog gives you a professional writer.

### Who is Tallyfy Changelog for?

It's perfect for:
- SaaS companies releasing weekly or bi-weekly
- Product teams tired of writing release notes
- Companies wanting consistent, professional communication
- Teams where developers document technical changes but need customer-friendly output
- Organizations scaling rapidly who need efficient processes

If you've ever spent Friday afternoon translating developer notes into customer announcements, this is for you.

### How long does implementation take?

Most companies are generating their first changelog within a week. This includes initial setup, customization for your brand voice, and team training. Since it's a managed service, we handle the technical implementation - you just provide guidance on your preferences.

## How it works

### What information does Tallyfy Changelog need?

The system works with your existing development workflow. When your team documents their work (in whatever system you use), Tallyfy Changelog processes these updates to create customer-ready announcements. No duplicate data entry required.

### Can it handle multiple products?

Absolutely. Whether you have one product or ten, each can have its own changelog with consistent quality. Many customers use it for their entire product portfolio - web app, mobile app, API, and more.

### How does it know what's important to customers?

Through intelligent processing that understands context. A color change might not make the cut, but a new integration definitely will. The system learns what matters based on your product type, customer base, and feedback patterns.

### What if we have internal changes that shouldn't be public?

The system intelligently filters what goes into your changelog. Internal optimizations, security patches that don't affect users, and infrastructure changes stay behind the scenes unless they deliver customer benefits.

## Customization

### Can we maintain our brand voice?

Yes! During setup, we configure the system to match your brand's tone - whether that's professional and formal, friendly and casual, or anywhere in between. Every changelog entry sounds like your team wrote it.

### What about our specific terminology?

Tallyfy Changelog learns your product's language. If you call them "workflows" not "processes," or "team members" not "users," the system maintains your terminology consistently across all entries.

### Can we review entries before they're published?

Of course. While most customers publish automatically after seeing the quality, you can always review and approve entries first. Many teams do this for the first few weeks, then switch to automatic once they trust the output.

### How do we handle different languages?

Currently, Tallyfy Changelog creates English changelogs. For companies needing multilingual support, we can discuss custom solutions during your consultation.

## Results and benefits

### How much time does this really save?

Most product teams report saving 10-15 hours per month. That's time previously spent gathering information from developers, translating technical speak, ensuring consistency, and formatting everything properly.

One customer told us: "What used to take me half a day now takes 5 minutes to review and publish."

### Will our customers actually read these?

Yes! Clear, benefit-focused changelogs see much higher engagement than technical release notes. Companies typically see:
- 3x more changelog views
- 40% higher feature adoption
- 60% fewer "what's new?" support tickets

### How do you measure success?

Success looks different for each company, but common metrics include:
- Time saved on documentation
- Increase in feature adoption rates
- Reduction in related support tickets
- Customer feedback on communication
- Consistency of release communications

We help you track what matters for your business.

### Do we need technical resources for implementation?

No. As a managed service, we handle all technical aspects. You just need someone who understands your product and customer communication goals - usually a product manager or marketing lead.

## Integration and workflow

### How does this fit our existing workflow?

Tallyfy Changelog adapts to how you work, not the other way around. Whether your team uses specific project management tools, development platforms, or documentation systems, we make it seamless.

### Can it integrate with our documentation site?

Yes. The output works with any modern documentation platform. We'll ensure the format matches your requirements perfectly.

### What about our release schedule?

Whether you release daily, weekly, monthly, or irregularly, Tallyfy Changelog adapts. Set your preferred schedule and the system handles the rest.

### How do we handle urgent updates?
