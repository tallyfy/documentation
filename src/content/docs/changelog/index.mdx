## What is Tallyfy Changelog?

Tallyfy Changelog is an AI-powered tool that automatically transforms technical GitHub issues into customer-friendly release notes for your software products. Using generative AI, it processes development activity from GitHub repositories and generates polished changelog entries that effectively communicate product improvements to users.

Unlike manual changelog creation, Tallyfy Changelog ensures consistent brand voice, proper categorization, and eliminates the time-consuming process of writing customer-facing release notes from scratch.

The tool has successfully processed over 400 changelog entries since 2021, maintaining a steady release cadence of approximately 3 updates per month for Tallyfy Pro customers.

Tallyfy Changelog is currently invite-only. For questions about implementation, schedule a call at https://tallyfy.com/amit.

## How does Tallyfy Changelog compare to alternatives?

Here's how Tallyfy Changelog stacks up against other changelog creation approaches:

### Key Differentiators

| Feature | Tallyfy Changelog | Manual Writing | Semantic Release | Auto-Changelog | GitHub Changelog Generator | Keep a Changelog |
|---------|------------------|----------------|------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|------------------|
| **AI Integration** | LLM models | None | None | None | None | None |
| **Brand Consistency** | Enforced product terminology | Manual effort | Generic | Generic | Generic | Manual effort |
| **Multi-Repository** | Built-in support | Complex coordination | Limited | Single repo | Single repo | Manual |
| **Categorization** | AI-powered 9 categories | Manual | Conventional commits | Git tags/commits | Labels/issues | Manual |
| **Duplicate Prevention** | Automatic tracking | Manual memory | Automatic | Basic | Basic | Manual |
| **Customer Focus** | AI optimized for user benefits | Requires expertise | Developer-focused | Developer-focused | Developer-focused | Manual |
| **GitHub Integration** | Issues to changelog | Manual | Commits only | Git commits | Issues/PRs/tags | Manual |
| **Automation Level** | Full automation | Manual | Full automation | Semi-automated | Semi-automated | Manual |

### Strengths Versus Alternatives

**Compared to Manual Changelog Writing:**
- Processes issues in hours instead of days—no need to read through dozens of GitHub issues
- Consistent brand voice and terminology enforced automatically
- Eliminates risk of missing important changes or duplicate entries
- AI understands user impact and frames technical changes appropriately

**Compared to Semantic Release:**
- Semantic release uses commit messages to determine version changes and generate changelogs automatically, but focuses on technical commit history rather than user-facing benefits
- Tallyfy Changelog transforms GitHub issues into customer-friendly language instead of relying on developer commit messages
- Built-in brand consistency versus generic conventional commit formatting

**Compared to Auto-Changelog & GitHub Changelog Generator:**
- These tools generate changelogs from git tags, issues, and pull requests, but require manual categorization and user-friendly rewrites
- AI-powered categorization versus manual sorting and labeling
- Customer-focused descriptions versus technical developer notes

**Compared to Keep a Changelog Standard:**
- Automated categorization into 9 predefined categories instead of manual sorting
- AI-generated user-friendly descriptions instead of developer-written technical notes
- Integrated with development workflow—no separate changelog maintenance needed
- Prevents technical jargon from reaching customer-facing documentation

### Ideal Use Cases

The Tallyfy Changelog Generator excels in these specific scenarios:

1. **Multi-Repository Products** - Coordinates changes across multiple repositories into unified release notes
2. **Customer-Facing Documentation** - Transforms technical GitHub issues into user-friendly product updates
3. **Brand Consistency** - Ensures all changelog entries follow product terminology and voice guidelines
4. **High-Volume Development** - Processes dozens of issues per release cycle automatically

Tallyfy Changelog understands both the technical implementation and the user impact. Development teams can focus on building features while the AI handles the communication layer automatically.

### Current Capabilities
