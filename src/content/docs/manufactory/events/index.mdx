After creating a project in Tallyfy Manufactory, you can start designing and building the single events schema you want to use for this project. Planning which event properties you'll collect is crucial for a successful implementation.


import PageTree from '@/components/PageTree.astro';

<PageTree />


If you have multiple event schemas, you'll need to create multiple projects - we offer one schema per project.
