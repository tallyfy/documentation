After creating a project, you can start designing/building the single events schema you would to use for this project. Planning which event properties you will collect is crucial for a successful implementation.


import PageTree from '@/components/PageTree.astro';

<PageTree />


If you have multiple event schemas, you would need to create multiple projects - we offer one schema per project.
