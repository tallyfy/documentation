snippet: Projects in Manufactory require unique API keys and separate schemas for
  users and events which must be set up before sending platform-specific data from
  different applications.

Creating a project is the first step to start using Manufactory.

Each project in Manufactory has its own separate API key you'll use to send data.

A project consists of two sections - a user schema and an event schema.

Those schemas need to be implemented before sending events to a project.

For example, if you have one iOS project and one Android project within your organization, you'll have your iOS app and your Android app send data to their respective project keys.
