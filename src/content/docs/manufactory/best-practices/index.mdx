title: Introduction to observability best practices
---

This guide shows you how to implement observability best practices with Tallyfy Manufactory. You'll learn to monitor and improve your event-driven systems effectively - turning raw events into actionable insights. These articles help both beginners and experienced users maximize Manufactory's capabilities.

## What is observability?

Observability lets you understand your systems' internal state through their output data. Think of it like a modern car diagnostic system - you get detailed performance data instead of just warning lights. This deep understanding proves essential for complex event-driven architectures that Tallyfy Manufactory manages.

Key benefits of using an observability practice include:

*   **Faster troubleshooting:** Find root causes in minutes instead of hours
*   **Proactive problem resolution:** Fix issues before users notice them
*   **Better system understanding:** See exactly how your systems behave in production

## Why observability matters for Tallyfy Manufactory users

Tallyfy Manufactory ingests, processes, and acts on events at scale. Observability becomes essential because it enables you to:

*   **Understand event lifecycles:** Track events through your systems and identify bottlenecks or failures
*   **Ensure process reliability:** Verify your automated workflows perform correctly
*   **Transform data into insights:** Convert Manufactory's event data into actionable improvements

Monitoring event behavior ensures your Manufactory-driven processes remain robust and efficient.

## Core pillars of observability in the context of Manufactory

Three core components matter most when implementing observability with Tallyfy Manufactory:

*   **Structured Events:** Well-formatted, data-rich events form the foundation for meaningful analysis. Tallyfy Manufactory requires structured event data to function effectively.
*   **Distributed Tracing[^1]:** Visualize an event's complete journey as it triggers actions across multiple services, including those coordinated by Manufactory.
*   **Metrics and Logs:** Traditional metrics and logs complement event data for comprehensive system monitoring. However, events themselves provide the deepest insights for event-driven processes.

## Getting started with observability

Start small with your observability journey - pick one critical workflow or pressing problem. Focus on understanding that single aspect through Tallyfy Manufactory, then expand gradually. Success comes from developing an observability mindset: stay curious about system behavior and make data-driven improvements.
