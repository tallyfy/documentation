title: Introduction to observability best practices
---

This section gives you a complete guide to understanding and implementing observability best practices tailored for Tallyfy Manufactory. Whether you're new to observability or looking to improve your existing practices, these articles will help you use Tallyfy Manufactory to its fullest potential for monitoring and improving your event-driven systems.

## What is observability?

Observability is the ability to understand the internal state of your systems by looking at the data they output. Think of it like a modern car diagnostic system: instead of just a few warning lights (traditional monitoring), you can plug in a computer and ask detailed questions about every aspect of the engine's performance based on the rich data it gives you. For complex, modern systems, especially the event-driven architectures that Tallyfy Manufactory is designed to manage, this deep understanding is crucial.

Key benefits of using an observability practice include:

*   **Faster troubleshooting:** Quickly find the root cause of issues.
*   **Proactive problem resolution:** Spot and address potential problems before they impact users.
*   **Better system understanding:** Get complete insights into how your systems behave in real-world scenarios.

## Why observability matters for Tallyfy Manufactory users

Tallyfy Manufactory is a powerful engine for ingesting, processing, and acting on events. Observability is essential for Manufactory users because it lets you:

*   **Understand event lifecycles:** Clearly see how events flow through your various systems and how Manufactory processes them, spotting bottlenecks or failures along the way.
*   **Ensure process reliability:** Get confidence that your automated workflows, managed or monitored by Manufactory, are working as expected.
*   **Use Manufactory data:** Tallyfy Manufactory collects and manages critical event data. Observability practices help you turn this data into actionable insights.

By watching how your events behave, you can make sure that the processes Manufactory drives are robust and efficient.

## Core pillars of observability in the context of Manufactory

While observability is a broad practice, a few core components are especially relevant when working with Tallyfy Manufactory:

*   **Structured Events:** These are the foundation. Well-formatted, data-rich events are essential for meaningful analysis. Tallyfy Manufactory thrives on structured event data to do its job.
*   **Distributed Tracing:** This lets you visualize the end-to-end journey of an event as it potentially triggers actions across multiple services or actors, including those coordinated by Manufactory.
*   **Metrics and Logs:** While Tallyfy Manufactory primarily focuses on events, traditional metrics (numerical summaries over time) and logs (text-based records) can give you complementary information for a complete view of your system's health. However, the deep insights for event-driven processes often come from the events themselves.

## Getting started with observability

Starting your observability journey doesn't need a massive upfront effort. The best approach is often to start small with a critical workflow or a pressing problem. Focus on understanding one aspect of your system events through Tallyfy Manufactory, and then iterate and expand your practice. More than specific tools, developing an observability mindset - a continuous curiosity about how your systems behave and a commitment to data-driven improvement - is key to success.
