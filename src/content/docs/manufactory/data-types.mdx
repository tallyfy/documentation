## Supported data types

Manufactory supports the following data types for storing your information:

- **TEXT** - Stores any text data with unlimited length. Use for names, descriptions, comments, or any character-based information.
  
- **INTEGER** - Stores whole numbers ranging from `-2,147,483,648` to `2,147,483,647`. Use for counts, IDs, or any numerical data without decimal points.
  
- **DATE** - Stores calendar dates. All values must use the format `yyyy-mm-dd`, for example: `2023-04-15`.
  
- **TIME** - Stores time values. All values must use the format `HH:MM:SS` in 24-hour format, for example: `14:10:00`.
  
- **TIMESTAMP** - Stores combined date and time values. All values must use the format `yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:SS`, for example: `2023-04-15 14:10:00`.
  
- **JSON** - Stores data in JSON format. Use for complex structured data that needs to be stored as a single value.

### Examples of Proper Data Type Usage

| Data Type | Example Value | Use Case |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| TEXT | "Machine A-123" | Equipment names, comments |
| INTEGER | 42 | Counts, quantities, identifiers |
| DATE | 2023-04-15 | Production dates, schedule dates |
| TIME | 14:10:00 | Shift times, operation times |
| TIMESTAMP | 2023-04-15 14:10:00 | Event timestamps, log entries |
| JSON | `{"status": "active", "temp": 72.5}` | Configuration settings, complex states |

:::note[Data Validation]
Manufactory validates all incoming data against these specified formats. Ensure your values match the required formats to avoid data rejection.
