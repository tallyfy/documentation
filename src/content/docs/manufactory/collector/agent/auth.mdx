## Authentication

Before you can start sending data to Manufactory, you need to fill the config file with the following values.

### Required keys

- `org_id` (required) string - Manufactory org ID.
- `project_id` (required) number - The project ID associated with this schema.
- `project_key` (required) string - of the project to be populated.
### config.yaml

```yaml
org_id: xyz
project_id: 12345
project_key: b0iqA8ezfhPgacy32PybGWghRkGrOo9H
```

`manufactory-agent` and `config.yaml` file should be within the same folder.
