snippet: The Manufactory agent serves as an alternative data transmission solution
  ideal for IoT devices with limited resources or scenarios requiring API load reduction
  through direct event sending capabilities.
title: Collecting events via our CLI agent
---

## Agent route

Our collector allows you to send actors data and events, which can be viewed in our custom interface.

The Manufactory agent can be useful in certain scenarios where you need to off-load your API from sending the events. Also, it can be used in any IoT device that has limited computing power or connectivity.

Please discuss the agent with us if you're interested in it https://tallyfy.com/amit
