## Agent route

The Tallyfy Manufactory collector allows you to send actors data and events, which can be viewed in our custom interface.

The Manufactory agent can be useful in certain scenarios where you need to off-load your API from sending the events. Also, it can be used in any IoT device that has limited computing power or connectivity.

Please discuss the agent with us if you're interested in it https://tallyfy.com/amit
