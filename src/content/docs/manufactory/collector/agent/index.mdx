snippet: The Manufactory agent serves as a data collection tool that enables sending
  actor data and events through various integration methods while being particularly
  suitable for IoT devices with limited resources or API offloading needs.
title: Collecting events via our CLI agent

## Agent route

Our collector allows you to send actors data and events, which can be viewed in our custom interface.

The Manufactory agent can be useful in certain scenarios where you need to off-load your API from sending the events. Also, it can be used in any IoT device that has limited computing power or connectivity.

Please discuss the agent with us if you're interested in it https://tallyfy.com/amit
