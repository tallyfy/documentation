## Send events

After filling the required values in the previous section, we can start sending actor's generated events via Manufactory agent.

### Required keys

- `--actor` (required) object - Pairs containing attribute name and the corresponding value while considering the correct attribute names and data types. Please refer to [Get Actors schema](/products/manufactory/actors/get_schema/).
- `--event` (required) object - Pairs containing attribute name and the corresponding value while considering the correct attribute names and data types. Please refer to [Get events schema](/manufactory/events/get_schema/).

### Actor example
```json
{
    "city": "New York",
    "country": "USA",
    "username": "john.doe",
    "email": "john.doe@email.com"
}
```

### Event example
```json
{
    "event_name": "login",
    "event_type": "user-actions",
    "made_purchase": false
}
```

Before we pass actor and event objects, we need to encode the objects using base64.


### Agent example

```shell
manufactory-agent --actor=ewogICAgImNpdHkiOiAiTmV3I \
                  --event=ewogICAgImV2ZW50X25hbWUiO==
```

The agent will handle the authentication and sending events, then it will shut down.
