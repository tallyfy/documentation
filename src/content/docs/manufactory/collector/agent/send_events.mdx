description: The Manufactory agent enables sending actor-generated events by requiring
  actor and event objects with proper attribute names and data types that must be
  base64 encoded before passing to the agent which handles authentication and event
  transmission automatically.

## Send events

After filling the required values in the previous section, we can start sending actor's generated events via Manufactory agent.

### Required keys

- `--actor` (required) object - Pairs containing attribute name and the corresponding value while considering the correct attribute names and data types. Please refer to [Get Actors schema](/products/manufactory/actors/get_schema/).
- `--event` (required) object - Pairs containing attribute name and the corresponding value while considering the correct attribute names and data types. Please refer to [Get events schema](/products/manufactory/events/get_schema/).

### Actor example
```json
{
    "city": "New York",
    "country": "USA",
    "username": "john.doe",
    "email": "john.doe@email.com"
}
```

### Event example
```json
{
    "event_name": "login",
    "event_type": "user-actions",
    "made_purchase": false
}
```

Before we pass actor and event objects, we need to encode the objects using base64.


### Agent example

```shell
manufactory-agent --actor=ewogICAgImNpdHkiOiAiTmV3I \
                  --event=ewogICAgImV2ZW50X25hbWUiO==
```

The agent will handle the authentication and sending events, then it will shut down.
