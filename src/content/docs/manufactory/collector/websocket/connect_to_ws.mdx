After successful authentication and getting client UUID along with actor profile ID, you can connect to our websocket server: `wss://collector.tallyfy.com/ws`

Once a websocket connection is established you will receive a message `Manufactory Collector âœ…`

The next step is that we need to pair the connection with the client/end-user. This is where actor profile ID and client UUID become active.

### Required keys

- `type` (required) string - The message type, in this case we will be using `auth`.
- `org_id` (required) string - Manufactory org ID.
- `project_id` (required) number - The project ID associated with this schema.
- `actor_profile_id` (required) number - The actor profile ID we got after authentication.
- `client_uuid` (required) string - the generated UUID we got after authentication.
### Websocket message example
```json
{
  "type": "auth",
  "org_id": "xyz",
  "project_id": 12345,
  "client_uuid": "e17a56a9-596f-40e6-b01c-d37136df1de8",
  "actor_profile_id": 1
}
```

### Websocket reply example

```json
{
  "type": "auth",
  "status": "ok"
}
```

Now we are able to send actor's generated events via the open websocket channel.
