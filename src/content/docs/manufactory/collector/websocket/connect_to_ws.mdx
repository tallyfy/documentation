snippet: The websocket connection process requires authentication with client UUID
  and actor profile ID followed by pairing the connection using an auth message containing
  organization details and profile credentials to establish an active event transmission
  channel.
title: Connect to our web socket server
---

After successful authentication and getting client UUID along with actor profile ID, you can connect to our websocket server: `wss://collector.tallyfy.com/ws`

Once a websocket connection is established you will receive a message `Manufactory Collector âœ…`

The next step is that we need to pair the connection with the client/end-user. This is where actor profile ID and client UUID become active.

### Required keys

- `type` (required) string - The message type, in this case we will be using `auth`.
- `org_id` (required) string - Manufactory org ID.
- `project_id` (required) number - The project ID associated with this schema.
- `actor_profile_id` (required) number - The actor profile ID we got after authentication.
- `client_uuid` (required) string - the generated UUID we got after authentication.
### Websocket message example
```json
{
  "type": "auth",
  "org_id": "xyz",
  "project_id": 12345,
  "client_uuid": "e17a56a9-596f-40e6-b01c-d37136df1de8",
  "actor_profile_id": 1
}
```

### Websocket reply example

```json
{
  "type": "auth",
  "status": "ok"
}
```

Now we are able to send actor's generated events via the open websocket channel.
