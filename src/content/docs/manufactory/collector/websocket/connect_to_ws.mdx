snippet: After establishing a websocket connection with Manufactory Collector, users
  need to authenticate by sending a message containing their org ID, project ID, actor
  profile ID, and client UUID to pair the connection with the client.

After successful authentication and getting client UUID along with actor profile ID, you can connect to our websocket server: `wss://collector.tallyfy.com/ws`

Once a websocket connection is established you will receive a message `Manufactory Collector âœ…`

The next step is that we need to pair the connection with the client/end-user. This is where actor profile ID and client UUID become active.

### Required keys

- `type` (required) string - The message type, in this case we will be using `auth`.
- `org_id` (required) string - Manufactory org ID.
- `project_id` (required) number - The project ID associated with this schema.
- `actor_profile_id` (required) number - The actor profile ID we got after authentication.
- `client_uuid` (required) string - the generated UUID we got after authentication.
### Websocket message example
```json
{
  "type": "auth",
  "org_id": "xyz",
  "project_id": 12345,
  "client_uuid": "e17a56a9-596f-40e6-b01c-d37136df1de8",
  "actor_profile_id": 1
}
```

### Websocket reply example

```json
{
  "type": "auth",
  "status": "ok"
}
```

Now we are able to send actor's generated events via the open websocket channel.
