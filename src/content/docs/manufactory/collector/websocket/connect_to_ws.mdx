description: Tallyfy Manufactory websocket authentication requires a two-phase process
  where clients first establish a connection to receive a confirmation message then
  send an auth message with org_id project_id client_uuid and actor_profile_id to
  authenticate before sending events.

After successful authentication and getting client UUID along with actor profile ID, you can connect to the Tallyfy Manufactory websocket server: `wss://collector.tallyfy.com/ws`

Once a websocket connection is established you will receive a message `Manufactory Collector ✅`

## WebSocket Authentication Flow

This diagram shows the complete authentication handshake between your client and the Manufactory WebSocket server.

 autonumber
 participant C as Client
 participant WS as WebSocket Server (collector.tallyfy.com)
 
 Note over C: Has client_uuid and actor_profile_id from prior authentication
 
 C->>WS: Connect to wss://collector.tallyfy.com/ws
 WS-->>C: "Manufactory Collector ✅"
 
 Note over C,WS: Pairing connection with client/user
 
 C->>WS: Send auth message {type: "auth", org_id, project_id, client_uuid, actor_profile_id}
 WS->>WS: Validate credentials
 WS-->>C: {type: "auth", status: "ok"}
 
 Note over C,WS: Connection authenticated Ready to send events
```

### What to notice

- **Two-phase authentication**: First the WebSocket connection itself, then the authentication message exchange
- **Required credentials**: The auth message must include all five required keys (type, org_id, project_id, client_uuid, actor_profile_id)
- **Sequential flow**: Each step must complete successfully before proceeding - the connection won't accept events until authentication succeeds

The next step is that we need to pair the connection with the client/end-user. This is where actor profile ID and client UUID become active.

### Required keys

- `type` (required) string - The message type, in this case we will be using `auth`.
- `org_id` (required) string - Manufactory org ID.
- `project_id` (required) number - The project ID associated with this schema.
- `actor_profile_id` (required) number - The actor profile ID we got after authentication.
- `client_uuid` (required) string - the generated UUID we got after authentication.
### Websocket message example
```json
{
  "type": "auth",
  "org_id": "xyz",
  "project_id": 12345,
  "client_uuid": "e17a56a9-596f-40e6-b01c-d37136df1de8",
  "actor_profile_id": 1
}
```

### Websocket reply example

```json
{
  "type": "auth",
  "status": "ok"
}
```

Now we are able to send actor's generated events via the open websocket channel.
