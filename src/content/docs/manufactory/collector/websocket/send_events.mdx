snippet: A secure websocket connection enables real-time event transmission by sending
  messages with specific type and attribute fields while receiving status confirmations
  as responses.
title: Send events via the web socket
---

After establishing a web socket connection, we can start sending user's generated events via the open channel.

### Required keys

- `type` (required) string - The message type, in this case we will be using `event`.
- `attributes` (required) object - Pairs containing attribute name and the corresponding value while considering the correct attribute names and data types. Please refer to [get events schema](/products/manufactory/events/get_schema/).

### Websocket message example
```json
{
  "type": "event",
  "attributes": {
    "event_name": "login",
    "event_type": "user-actions",
    "made_purchase": false
  }
}
```

### Websocket reply example

```json
{
  "type": "event",
  "status": "ok"
}
```
