Before you can start sending data to Tallyfy Manufactory via a websocket, you need to authenticate the client/end-user.

You can authenticate users using the endpoint `POST /auth`.

Required header:

- `X-Manufactory-Auth` - Project key of the project to be populated.

### Required keys

- `org_id` (required) string - Manufactory org ID.
- `project_id` (required) number - The project ID associated with this schema.
- `actor_profile` (required) object - Pairs containing attribute name and the corresponding value while considering the correct attribute names and data types. Please refer to [Get Actors schema](/products/manufactory/actors/get_schema/).

### Request example
```json
{
  "org_id": "xyz",
  "project_id": 12345,
  "actor_profile":{
    "city": "New York",
    "country": "USA",
    "username": "john.doe",
    "email": "john.doe@email.com"

  }
}
```

### Response example

```json
{
  "org_id": "xyz",
  "project_id": 12345,
  "actor_profile_id": 1,
  "client_uuid": "dcd21714-894c-46bc-9d59-ae9f22753205"
}
```

The generated client UUID is limited to this specific user profile, and it's valid for a 12 hours session. After 12 hours, you would need to re-authenticate the client.
