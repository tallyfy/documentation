snippet: A data collection system enables event and actor information transmission
  through REST API websocket or CLI agent integration while providing a simple interface
  for viewing the collected data.
title: Collector
---

Our collector allows you to send actor data and events, which can be viewed in our (simple) custom interface.

Data ingestion can be made via a REST API, a websocket or a CLI agent. Please note, data ingestion cannot be done before creating both actors and events schemas. Please refer to [Implementation Guide](/products/manufactory/implementation/).

The collector base URL is:
