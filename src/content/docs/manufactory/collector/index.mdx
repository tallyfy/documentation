Our collector allows you to send actor data and events, which can be viewed in our (simple) custom interface.

Data ingestion can be made via a REST API, a websocket or a CLI agent. Please note, data ingestion cannot be done before creating both actors and events schemas. Please refer to [Implementation Guide](/manufactory/implementation/).

The collector base URL is:

`https://collector.tallyfy.com/`
