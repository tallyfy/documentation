Tallyfy Manufactory is an events lifecycle engine that collects, queries, and triggers events from authenticated users or devices. Think of it as your event infrastructure backbone - scalable, reliable, and refreshingly straightforward.

This API-based service handles the essential plumbing of event management while you maintain complete control over analytics and visualization. We manage the infrastructure complexity so you can focus on extracting insights from your data.

Tallyfy Manufactory serves organizations with data science teams and developers who need robust event management without the complexity. You get industrial-strength infrastructure while keeping full ownership of your analysis and triggered actions.

As a cost-effective alternative to platforms like Mixpanel, Heap Analytics, and Amplitude, Manufactory makes sense when you can build your own visualizations. Why pay premium prices for features you'll build anyway?

The event lifecycle in Tallyfy Manufactory follows three simple stages:

1. **Ingesting**: Collect events through REST API or websocket at any scale. Events support rich metadata and user profile information, positioning Tallyfy Manufactory as a practical alternative to costly event collection tools like Mixpanel, Google Analytics, Amplitude, and Snowflake.

2. **Querying**: Access your data without restrictions on scale, frequency, or query complexity. Most users connect their favorite BI tools (Tableau, PowerBI) to build custom dashboards or embed visualizations directly into applications. Need your data elsewhere? Export everything as an SQLite file anytime - your data remains yours.

3. **Triggers**: Set up webhooks that fire when specific conditions occur, enabling real-time responses to meaningful events in your system.

## How much does Tallyfy Manufactory cost?

Tallyfy Manufactory pricing is straightforward: you pay only for the total number of stored events, calculated daily at midnight (CST).

No hidden fees for queries or triggers. No usage limits. No surprise charges. Query your data as often as you need - it's all included.

## How can you control costs with TTL?

Most Tallyfy Manufactory users retain all historical events for comprehensive analysis. However, you can implement a Time To Live (TTL) policy to automatically remove events after a specified period - such as 12 months.

TTL policies help manage costs by purging outdated events that no longer provide business value. After all, those 5-year-old button clicks probably aren't driving today's decisions.

## What are Tallyfy Manufactory's key differentiators?

Tallyfy Manufactory stands out as an events infrastructure service through:

1. **Transparent Pricing**: Pay only for stored events. Unlimited queries, triggers, and API calls come standard - no metered billing surprises.

2. **Real-Time Intelligence**: Configure webhooks that react instantly to event patterns. For instance: trigger an alert when a user attempts multiple upgrades within 24 hours, catching frustration signals before they become churn statistics.

3. **Bring Your Own Analytics**: Leverage your existing data science stack and BI tools. We provide the infrastructure; you create the insights that matter to your business.

## What is Tallyfy Manufactory not designed for?

Tallyfy Manufactory has clear boundaries:

* **System Logging**: Specialized logging solutions handle anonymous system logs better. Tallyfy Manufactory excels with events from identified users or objects.

* **Non-Technical Teams**: Without built-in dashboards or visualization tools, Tallyfy Manufactory requires technical expertise. Teams needing drag-and-drop analytics should consider full-featured platforms like Mixpanel.

* **Anonymous Traffic**: Every event needs an identified profile - whether person or device. Anonymous event tracking isn't supported.

* **Public Website Analytics**: Built for authenticated user environments, not anonymous visitor tracking.

## How is Tallyfy Manufactory organized?

## Glossary

* **Project**: A logical subdivision within your Tallyfy Manufactory organization. Projects typically align with different products, applications, or business units.

* **Event**: A structured data point capturing a specific user or system interaction within your application.

* **Actor**: The authenticated entity - person, system, or device - responsible for generating an event.

* **Properties**: Key-value attributes attached to events and actors. Note that actor properties reflect current state only; historical property changes aren't tracked.

* **Organization ID**: Your unique `org_id` serves as the authentication key for schema creation and websocket connections. Each organization ID maps to one customer application with its own distinct actor profiles.
