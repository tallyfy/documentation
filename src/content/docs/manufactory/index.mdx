snippet: A scalable event lifecycle engine that ingests queries and triggers events
  from authenticated users while providing full control over analytics visualization
  and data management at a cost-effective price point based solely on stored events.
title: Overview
---

Tallyfy Manufactory is an events lifecycle engine that handles the collection, querying, and triggering of events from authenticated users or devices. This highly scalable, API-based service provides essential event infrastructure while allowing you to maintain control over analytics and visualization.

Manufactory is designed for organizations with data science teams and developers who want to offload the complexities of event management while retaining full control over analysis and triggered actions. It serves as a cost-effective alternative to comprehensive platforms like Mixpanel, Heap Analytics, and Amplitude when you have the capability to build your own visualizations.

The event lifecycle in Manufactory consists of three stages:

1. **Ingesting**: Collect events via REST API or websocket at any scale. Events can include metadata and user/profile information, making Manufactory a lower-cost alternative to event collection tools like Mixpanel, Google Analytics, Amplitude, and Snowflake.

2. **Querying**: Access your data without limitations on scale, frequency, or query type. Most users build dashboards in BI tools (Tableau, PowerBI) using their existing data science capabilities or integrate visualizations into their applications. You can also export your complete dataset as an SQLite file at any time.

3. **Triggers**: Create webhooks based on custom criteria to initiate actions when specific conditions are met.

## Pricing

Pricing is based solely on the total number of stored events, calculated daily at midnight (CST). There are no additional costs for queries or triggers.

## Control Costs with TTL

While most users retain all historical events, you can set a Time To Live (TTL) to automatically delete events after a specified period (e.g., 12 months). This prevents unlimited cost growth by removing older events that may no longer be needed.

## Key Differentiators

Manufactory offers several advantages as an events infrastructure service:

1. **Cost-Effective**: Pay only for stored events, starting at $5/month. Enjoy unlimited querying, triggers, and event management with no hidden costs.

2. **Near Real-Time Triggers**: Create webhooks that respond almost immediately to incoming events. Example: "Send a webhook to a specified URL if a user attempts to upgrade more than 5 times in 24 hours."

3. **Customizable Analytics**: Leverage your existing data science capabilities and BI tools to create tailored visualizations and analyses.

## Not Designed For

Manufactory is not suitable for:

* **System Logging**: Better solutions exist for anonymous or system logs. Manufactory is optimized for events from identified users or objects.

* **Non-Technical Users**: The platform doesn't include built-in analytics or visualization tools. Users need data science capabilities or BI tools to analyze their data.

* **Anonymous Events**: Events should be associated with an identified profile (person or device).

* **Public Websites**: Designed for authenticated users rather than anonymous visitors.

## Organization Structure

## Glossary

* **Project**: A subdivision within your Manufactory organization, typically representing different products, applications, or sections.

* **Event**: A data point representing a user or system interaction with your application.

* **Actor**: The individual, system, or device that performed an action generating an event.

* **Properties**: Attributes associated with events and actors. For actors, only current property values are stored, not historical changes.

* **Organization ID**: Each Manufactory organization has a unique `org_id` used for schema creation and websocket authentication. Each customer application corresponds to one organization ID and a distinct set of actor profiles.
