## Use cases

To make Tallyfy Manufactory and the Tallyfy Pro complementary, with Tallyfy as the main product, you can integrate the event lifecycle capabilities of Tallyfy Manufactory to enhance and automate the workflow management features of Tallyfy Pro. Here’s a step-by-step approach:

#### Seamless Integration of Event Handling

1. Enhanced Workflow Automation
   Triggering Workflows:
   - Implementation: Develop connectors in the Tallyfy app that listen for specific events from Tallyfy Manufactory.
   - Example: When Tallyfy Manufactory detects a machine maintenance alert, it sends a webhook to Tallyfy, which automatically initiates a predefined maintenance workflow.
   - Another example: Manufactory triggers a trigger based on certain event types, and this trigger launches a process.
2. Event-Based Task Assignments:
   - Implementation: Create a mapping system within Tallyfy to assign tasks based on specific events captured by Tallyfy Manufactory.
   - Example: Assign a repair task to a technician when a machine downtime event is recorded.

3. Live Status Monitoring:
   - Implementation: Integrate a real-time data feed from Tallyfy Manufactory into Tallyfy’s dashboard.
   - Example: Display live updates of workflow statuses and task progress based on the latest event data.

4. Dynamic Workflow Adjustments:
   - Implementation: Develop dynamic adjustment capabilities in Tallyfy workflows that respond to real-time event changes from Tallyfy Manufactory.
   - Example: If a critical temperature threshold is exceeded in a manufacturing process, automatically escalate the workflow to involve senior engineers.

#### Enhanced User Experience

1. Intelligent Reminders:
   - Implementation: Use event data from Tallyfy Manufactory to send context-aware reminders in Tallyfy.
   - Example: Notify a user to perform a task if a machine's performance drops below a certain level.

2. Proactive Alerts:
   - Implementation: Set up a system in Tallyfy to send proactive alerts based on predictive analysis from event data.
   - Example: Alert users about potential equipment failure based on trends in the time-series data.

#### Expanding Use Cases and Capabilities

1. Tailored Solutions:
   - Implementation: Develop industry-specific templates that combine event data from Tallyfy Manufactory with workflows in Tallyfy.
   - Example: For manufacturing, create a workflow template that integrates machine event data with maintenance and quality control processes.
2. Scalable Infrastructure:
   - Implementation: Leverage Tallyfy Manufactory’s scalable event processing to support high-volume and complex workflows in Tallyfy.
   - Example: Handle large-scale production events and seamlessly integrate them into detailed workflows in Tallyfy.
3. Extended Integrations:
   - Implementation: Enable Tallyfy Manufactory to act as an intermediary for collecting and processing events from various third-party services, which then trigger workflows in Tallyfy.
   - Example: Integrate with third-party CRM systems to trigger customer follow-up workflows based on sales event data.
4. API-Driven Flexibility:
   Implementation: Provide robust APIs for developers to leverage the combined functionalities of Tallyfy Manufactory and the Tallyfy app.
   Example: Allow external applications to trigger workflows in Tallyfy based on custom events processed by Tallyfy Manufactory.

#### Advanced Data Handling and Analytics

1. Data Ingestion and Querying:
   - Implementation: Utilize Tallyfy Manufactory’s robust data ingestion capabilities to feed detailed event data into Tallyfy’s analytics modules.
   - Example: Ingest event data on machine performance and visualize it within Tallyfy’s dashboard to identify trends and optimize workflows.
2. Custom Dashboards and BI Integration:
   - Implementation: Allow users to build custom dashboards within Tallyfy or integrate with existing BI tools like Tableau or PowerBI.
   - Example: Visualize workflow efficiency metrics alongside event data from Tallyfy Manufactory to provide comprehensive insights.
3. Predictive Maintenance and Optimization:
   - Implementation: Use predictive analytics on time-series data from Tallyfy Manufactory to forecast maintenance needs and optimize workflows in Tallyfy.
   - Example: Automatically adjust maintenance schedules based on predictive analysis of machine performance trends.
