snippet: Manufactory's event-based triggers enable real-time responses to specific
  actor actions through defined conditions and criteria that determine when notifications
  or alerts should be executed based on data patterns and actor behaviors.
title: Triggers
---

Manufactory supports (almost) real-time triggers and we sometimes call them triggers event-based triggers.

This is unique - because many other systems don't offer you the ability to act quickly on incoming data patterns.

Event-based triggers are fired based on actor actions. For example, a trigger could be set up to fire when an actor logs in or logs out, or when an actor takes a specific action within a system or application with or without a specific time-frame or even a specific occurrence count.

A Manufactory trigger consists of the following:

- A condition is a specific rule or set of rules that must be met in order for the trigger to fire.
- A criteria is a specific set of conditions that must be met in order for the trigger to be executed.

Conditions can be based on a variety of factors, such as actor actions, system events or updating actor's attributes. For example, a condition could be set up to trigger a notification when a certain amount of time has passed since an actor last logged into an application, or when a specific event is stored.

Criteria, on the other hand, are a set of conditions that must be met in order for the trigger to be executed. For example, a criteria could be set up to trigger an alert when a user logs in from an unrecognized device and is attempting to access sensitive data. In this case, the criteria could include conditions such as the user's location, the type of device being used, and the time of day.
