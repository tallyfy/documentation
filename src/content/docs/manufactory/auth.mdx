## Authentication for Manufactory

Tallyfy uses a centralized identity and access management system at [account.tallyfy.com](https://account.tallyfy.com) for all products. This system handles sign up, sign in, SSO, and account management functions like password recovery across all Tallyfy products.

If your account is a member of multiple organizations, you can easily switch between them. Click your name/profile picture in the top-right corner and select "Switch organization" to access other roles and organizations associated with your account.

Manufactory implements a secure, customized authentication system for each customer. This approach ensures maximum security while meeting your specific implementation requirements.

### Security Approach

For security reasons, we do not publish our authentication methods publicly. This security-by-design approach:

- Reduces potential attack vectors
- Provides customer-specific security mechanisms
- Ensures only authorized systems can connect to your data
- Prevents unauthorized access to your manufacturing information

### Setting Up Authentication

To establish authentication for your Manufactory implementation:

1. **Initial consultation** - Discuss your security requirements with our team
2. **Custom configuration** - Receive secure authentication credentials specific to your organization
3. **Implementation** - Our team will guide you through integrating the authentication method with your systems
4. **Verification** - Test the authentication to ensure proper security
