## How to change a member into a guest

Deactivate the member's account first, then convert them to a guest. It's a two-step process.

### What you need
- Administrator permissions
- The person must be an active [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) in your Tallyfy organization

### Step 1: Deactivate the member account

You can't convert an active member directly - deactivate their account first.
<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Members**.
2. Click the name of the member you want to change.
3. Scroll down and click **Deactivate Account**.

4. Tallyfy asks what to do with their incomplete [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/). Two options:
   - **Reassign tasks** - transfer their work to other team members
   - **Deactivate without reassigning** - keep tasks unassigned (you can reassign later)
</Steps>

### Step 2: Change the deactivated account to guest

Now convert them:
<Steps>
1. Return to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Members**.
2. Find the deactivated person - they'll show as "Disabled".
3. Click **Convert to guest** next to their name.
</Steps>

That's it.

### What happens after conversion

The change takes effect immediately:

- Their account switches from [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) to [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) status
- They lose dashboard access - no more logging into Tallyfy directly
- They can *only* work on [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) through [guest links](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-to-find-a-guest-task-link-in-tallyfy/) sent by email
- You free up a paid member seat
