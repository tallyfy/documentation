## How to change a member into a guest

### What you need
- Administrator permission level.
- The person must currently be an active [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) in your Tallyfy account.

### Step 1: Deactivate the Member account

Before you can change someone to a guest, you first need to deactivate their member account.
<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Members**.
2. Click on the name of the member you want to change.
3. Scroll down their profile page and click **Deactivate Account**.

4. Tallyfy will ask what to do with their unfinished [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/). Choose one:
   - **Reassign tasks**: Give their tasks to other active members.
   - **Deactivate without reassigning**: Leave the tasks unassigned for now.
</Steps>

### Step 2: Change the deactivated account to Guest

Now that the account is deactivated:
<Steps>
1. Go back to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Members**.
2. Find the member you just deactivated (they might be marked as "Disabled" or similar).
3. Click **Convert to guest** next to their name.
</Steps>

### What happens when you convert them
- Their account type changes from [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) to [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/).
- They lose their regular Tallyfy access.
- From now on, they can *only* access specific [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) assigned to them using special [guest links](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-to-find-a-guest-task-link-in-tallyfy/).
- They no longer use a paid member seat.
