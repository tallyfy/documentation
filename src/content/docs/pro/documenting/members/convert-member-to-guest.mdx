## How to change a member into a guest

To convert a member to a guest in Tallyfy, you'll deactivate their account first, then change their status to guest. This two-step process takes about 2 minutes.

### What you need
- Administrator permissions
- The person must currently be an active [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) in your Tallyfy organization

### Step 1: Deactivate the Member account

You can't convert an active member directly - you need to deactivate their account first. Here's how:
<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Members**.
2. Click on the name of the member you want to change.
3. Scroll down their profile page and click **Deactivate Account**.

4. Tallyfy asks what to do with their incomplete [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/). You've got two options:
   - **Reassign tasks**: Transfer their work to other team members
   - **Deactivate without reassigning**: Keep the tasks unassigned (you can reassign them later)
</Steps>

### Step 2: Change the deactivated account to Guest

Almost done. Now let's convert them to a guest:
<Steps>
1. Return to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Members**
2. Find the person you just deactivated - they'll show as "Disabled" or have a similar status
3. Click **Convert to guest** next to their name
</Steps>

That's it.

### What happens after conversion

The change takes effect immediately. Here's what changes for that user:

- Their account switches from [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) to [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) status
- They lose dashboard access - no more logging into Tallyfy directly
- They can *only* work on [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) through special [guest links](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-to-find-a-guest-task-link-in-tallyfy/) sent by email
- You free up a paid member seat (great for keeping costs down)
