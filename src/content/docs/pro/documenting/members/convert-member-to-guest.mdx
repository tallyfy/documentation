## Converting a member to a guest

### Prerequisites
- Administrator access
- An active [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) account to convert

### Step 1: Disable the member account

1. Navigate to **Settings > Organization > Members**
2. Click on the profile name of the member to convert
3. Scroll down and click **Deactivate Account**

4. Choose one of the following options:
   - **Reassign [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/)** to other active members
   - **Deactivate without reassigning** tasks

### Step 2: Convert to guest status

1. Navigate to **Settings > Organization > Members**
2. Locate the disabled member's profile
3. Click **Convert to guest**

### What happens during conversion
- The user's [role](/products/pro/documenting/members/) changes from member to [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/)
- Their access becomes limited to only specific assigned [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/)
- They'll now access tasks through [guest links](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-to-find-a-guest-task-link-in-tallyfy/) instead of logging in
