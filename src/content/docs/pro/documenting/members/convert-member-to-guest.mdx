4. Choose one of the following options:
   - **Reassign tasks** to other active members
   - **Deactivate without reassigning** tasks

### Step 2: Convert to guest status

1. Navigate to **Settings > Organization > Members**
2. Locate the disabled member's profile
3. Click **Convert to guest**

### What happens during conversion
- The user's role changes from member to guest
- Their access becomes limited to only specific assigned tasks
- They'll now access tasks through guest links instead of logging in
