## Managing pending member invitations

### What you need
- Administrator permission level.
- Outstanding invitations showing as "Pending" in your member list.

### When to resend an invitation
Common reasons to resend an invitation:
- They never received the original email.
- Email likely ended up in spam folder.
- The invitation link expired (invites have time limits).
- They accidentally deleted the invitation email.

### When to withdraw (cancel) an invitation
Common reasons to withdraw an invitation:
- You invited the wrong email address by mistake.
- Plans changed and they're no longer joining your team.
- You need to reinvite them with different permissions.
- You need their paid [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) seat for someone else.

### How to resend or withdraw an invitation

<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Members**.
2. Scroll down to the **Pending Invitations** list.
3. Find the invitation you want to manage.
4. In the **Action** column for that invitation, click either:
   - **Resend**: To send the invitation email again.
   - **Withdraw**: To cancel the invitation completely.
</Steps>

### What to expect after each action

**After resending:**
- They receive a fresh invitation email with a new link.
- The acceptance deadline resets to full time.
- No additional [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) seat gets consumed.

**After withdrawing:**
- Their original invitation link becomes invalid instantly.
- The reserved [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) seat opens up for new invites.
- The invitation disappears from your pending list completely.
