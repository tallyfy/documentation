## Managing member invitations

### Prerequisites
- Administrator access
- Pending invitations to manage

### When to resend invitations
Resend invitations when:
- The recipient reports not receiving the original invitation
- The invitation email might have gone to spam
- The original invitation has expired
- The recipient accidentally deleted the invitation email

### When to withdraw invitations
Withdraw invitations when:
- You invited the wrong person
- The person is no longer joining your organization
- You need to change the role or permissions for the invitation
- You want to free up a member seat for someone else

### Steps to manage invitations

1. Navigate to **Settings > Organization > Members**
2. Scroll to the **Pending Invitations** section
3. Locate the pending invitation you want to manage
4. In the **Action** column, select either:
   - **Resend** to send another invitation email
   - **Withdraw** to cancel the invitation

### After resending or withdrawing

After resending:
- The recipient will receive a new invitation email
- The expiration timer resets for the new invitation
- No additional member seat is used

After withdrawing:
- The invitation becomes invalid immediately
- The member seat becomes available for a new invitation
- The withdrawn invitation disappears from the pending list
