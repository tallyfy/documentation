## Managing pending member invitations

Need to resend or cancel a member invitation? You can manage all pending invites directly from your Organization Members settings - whether someone's email got lost in spam or you simply invited the wrong address.

### What you need
- Administrator permission level
- At least one invitation showing as "Pending" in your member list

### When to resend an invitation
You'll want to resend when:
- The person says they never got your email (happens more than you'd think)
- Their invitation expired - yes, these links have time limits
- They deleted the email by accident
- You suspect it's sitting in their spam folder

### When to withdraw (cancel) an invitation
Time to withdraw? Here's when:
- Oops - you typed the wrong email address
- Plans changed and they're not joining after all
- You need to reinvite them with different permissions
- You need that paid [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) seat for someone else right now

### How to resend or withdraw an invitation

<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Members**.
2. Scroll down to the **Pending Invitations** list.
3. Find the invitation you want to manage.
4. In the **Action** column for that invitation, click either:
   - **Resend**: To send the invitation email again.
   - **Withdraw**: To cancel the invitation completely.
</Steps>

Simple as that.

### What to expect after each action

**After resending:**
- They'll get a brand new invitation email with a fresh link
- The acceptance deadline resets - they get the full time again
- Don't worry - this doesn't use up another [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) seat

**After withdrawing:**
- That invitation link? Dead instantly.
- The [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) seat opens up - you can invite someone else right away
- The invitation vanishes from your pending list (no trace left)
