## Managing pending member invitations

You can resend or withdraw pending invites from your Organization Members settings - whether someone's email got lost in spam or you invited the wrong address.

### What you need
- Administrator permission level
- At least one invitation showing as "Pending" in your member list

### When to resend an invitation
- The person never received your email
- The invitation link expired
- They deleted the email by accident
- It's stuck in their spam folder

### When to withdraw (cancel) an invitation
- You typed the wrong email address
- Plans changed and they're not joining
- You need to reinvite them with different permissions
- You need that paid [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) seat for someone else

### How to resend or withdraw an invitation

<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Members**.
2. Scroll down to the **Pending Invitations** list.
3. Find the invitation you want to manage.
4. In the **Action** column, click either:
   - **Resend** - sends the invitation email again.
   - **Withdraw** - cancels the invitation permanently.
</Steps>

### What happens after each action

**After resending:**
- They'll get a new invitation email with a fresh link
- The old invitation link stops working
- This doesn't use another [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) seat - it updates the existing invite

**After withdrawing:**
- The invitation link dies instantly
- The [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) seat opens up for someone else
- The invitation is fully deleted from your pending list
- If that person doesn't belong to any other Tallyfy organization, their user record is also removed
