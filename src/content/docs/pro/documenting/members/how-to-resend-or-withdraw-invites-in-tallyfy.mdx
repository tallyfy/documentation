## Managing pending member invitations

### What you need
- Administrator permission level.
- One or more invitations that are still waiting to be accepted ("Pending Invitations").

### When to resend an invitation
You might need to resend an invitation if:
- The person says they never received the first email.
- You think the first email went into their spam folder.
- The original invitation link expired.
- The person accidentally deleted the email.

### When to withdraw (cancel) an invitation
You might need to withdraw an invitation if:
- You accidentally invited the wrong person.
- The person you invited is no longer joining your company.
- You need to invite them again with a different role or permissions.
- You need the paid [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) seat back to invite someone else.

### How to resend or withdraw an invitation

<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Members**.
2. Scroll down to the **Pending Invitations** list.
3. Find the invitation you want to manage.
4. In the **Action** column for that invitation, click either:
   - **Resend**: To send the invitation email again.
   - **Withdraw**: To cancel the invitation completely.
</Steps>

### What happens next?

After resending:
- The person gets a new invitation email with a new link.
- The time limit for accepting the invitation restarts.
- It doesn't use up another paid [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) seat.

After withdrawing:
- The original invitation link stops working immediately.
- The paid [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) seat is freed up, so you can invite someone else.
- The withdrawn invitation is removed from the pending list.
