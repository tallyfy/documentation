## Understanding Light member capabilities

Light members work with focused task completion in Tallyfy - they can't create or edit templates, but they excel at getting assigned work done. Light members are designed for task-focused team members who don't need full platform capabilities.

:::note[Light user availability]
**Introduced**: October 2024

**Eligibility requirements**:
- Organizations with Single Sign-On (SSO) configured
- Organizations meeting specific configuration requirements
- Can be manually enabled by support for specific cases

**Why these requirements?** Light users solve the SSO problem where company email addresses can't be added as guests. The role provides a middle ground between guests and full members.
:::

### What Light members can do

Light members keep it simple. They focus on task execution without the overhead of template management.

#### Core capabilities

Here's what Light members bring to the table:

- **Task Work:**
  - Complete assigned [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in running processes
  - View task details, instructions, and attached files
  - Add comments to tasks they're working on
  - Upload files when completing tasks
  - Mark tasks as complete or incomplete

- **Process Participation:**
  - Access [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) where they have assigned tasks
  - View the overall process flow (but only for processes they're part of)
  - See their upcoming tasks in the dashboard
  - Track their task completion history

- **Basic Access:**
  - Log into Tallyfy with their own credentials
  - Update their profile information
  - View [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) they're collaborating with on tasks
  - Access the mobile app for on-the-go task completion

:::note[Template visibility for Light members]
Light members only see templates in their library when an Administrator grants them LAUNCH permission. Even then, they can't edit or create templates - just launch processes from them (if that permission is specifically granted).

**Knowledge-only mode**: Light members are perfect for [knowledge-only mode](/products/pro/tutorials/knowledge-only-mode/) - they can view procedures and reference materials without tracking execution. Grant them view access to templates used as documentation, and they can search and reference SOPs without launching formal processes.
:::

:::tip[Light members vs Guests]
Don't confuse Light members with [Guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/). Light members are users within your organization with their own login credentials. Guests are external email addresses (like customers or vendors) who only access specific tasks via email links.
:::

### What Light members cannot do

The restrictions are clear and intentional. Light members can't:

- **Template Management:**
  - Create new [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)
  - Edit existing templates (even with permissions)
  - Organize templates into folders
  - Import or export templates
  - Delete archived templates

- **Process Control:**
  - Launch new processes (unless specifically given LAUNCH permission)
  - Change process settings or permissions
  - Reassign tasks to other members
  - Delete running processes (soft delete or permanent)
  - Create pre-runs or manage automated actions

- **Administrative Functions:**
  - Invite new members or guests
  - View all organization members
  - Access account management information
  - Change organization settings
  - View API keys or integrations
  - Manage permissions for other users

- **Process Management:**
  - Archive or unarchive processes (button appears but doesn't function)
  - Bulk operations on processes
  - Export process data directly

### Launching processes as a Light member

Here's something that surprises many people: Light members CAN launch processes, but only when specifically allowed.

By default, Light members cannot launch any processes. But here's the key - Administrators can grant LAUNCH permission for specific templates to Light members. When they do, those Light members can start new processes from those templates.

#### How to enable process launching for Light members

Administrators follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the template's **Config** settings
2. Find the Light member who needs launch access
3. Grant them the **LAUNCH** permission for that specific template
4. The template now appears in the Light member's library with a launch button

#### Smart use cases for Light member launching

This selective launching capability opens up powerful workflows:

- **Daily checklists** - Let warehouse staff start their morning safety inspection process
- **Customer intake** - Allow receptionists to launch new client onboarding workflows
- **Incident reporting** - Enable field workers to initiate safety incident processes
- **Quality checks** - Let production line workers start quality control processes

The beauty? Light members can start these pre-approved processes without ever seeing or editing the template design. They just launch and go.

:::tip[Pro tip for process launching]
Create template folders specifically for Light member processes. Name them clearly like "Daily Operations - Light Users" or "Field Team Processes". This helps Light members quickly find the processes they're allowed to launch while keeping other templates out of sight.

### When Light members make sense

Light members shine in specific scenarios. Here's where they fit perfectly:

**Field and frontline workers:**
- Delivery drivers checking off route stops
- Technicians completing service checklists
- Construction crews following safety procedures
- Healthcare workers documenting patient rounds

**External collaborators:**
- Contractors working on specific projects
- Vendors completing quality checks
- Partners handling designated tasks
- Temporary staff during busy seasons

**Task-focused internal roles:**
- Data entry specialists processing forms
- Warehouse staff managing inventory counts
- Customer service reps following call scripts
- Reception desk handling visitor check-ins

**Knowledge base users:**
- Teams who need to reference [knowledge-only procedures](/products/pro/tutorials/knowledge-only-mode/)
- Staff accessing SOPs and how-to guides without tracking
- Employees viewing reference materials and documentation
- Workers who read procedures but don't need formal task completion

### Optimization strategies with Light members

Smart organizations use Light members strategically. Consider this approach:

1. **Audit your current Full members** - Look for people who only complete tasks, never creating or editing templates
2. **Convert task-only users** - Switch them to Light member status for better role alignment
3. **Set clear role boundaries** - Reserve Full member licenses for process designers and managers
4. **Monitor usage patterns** - Track who actually creates templates versus who just executes tasks

:::tip[Role optimization example]
A 100-person company with 20 process designers and 80 field workers? Keep 20 Full member licenses for the designers. Convert those 80 field workers to Light members. This aligns roles with actual needs while maintaining full functionality.

### Upgrading from Light to Full member

Need to give a Light member more capabilities? [Changing roles](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-can-i-change-a-members-role-in-tallyfy/) takes seconds:

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Members**
2. Find the Light member you want to upgrade
3. Click their role dropdown and select **Standard** or **Administrator**
4. Changes take effect immediately - no logout required

The member keeps all their task history and active assignments. They just gain new capabilities based on their new role.

### Light member best practices

Make Light members successful with these tips:

**Clear task instructions** - Since Light members can't edit templates, make sure task descriptions are crystal clear. Include step-by-step guidance, examples, and expected outcomes.

**Mobile-first thinking** - Many Light members work from mobile devices. Design your tasks with mobile screens in mind - shorter descriptions, simpler forms, fewer required fields.

**Permission planning** - If Light members need to launch specific processes, grant LAUNCH permission only for those templates. Keep their interface clean and focused.

**Training simplicity** - Light members need minimal training. Show them how to log in, find assigned tasks, and mark them complete. That's it. The limited interface means less confusion.
