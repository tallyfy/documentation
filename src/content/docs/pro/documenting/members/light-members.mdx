## What Light members can do

Light members complete assigned work in Tallyfy but can't create or edit templates. They're built for people who do tasks, not design workflows.

:::note[Light user availability]
**Introduced**: October 2024

**Requirements**:
- Organizations with Single Sign-On (SSO) configured, OR
- Manually enabled by Tallyfy support for specific orgs

Light users solve the SSO problem where company email addresses can't be added as [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/). The role sits between guests and full members.
:::

### Capabilities

- **Tasks** - Complete assigned [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), view details and attached files, add comments, upload files, mark tasks complete or incomplete
- **Processes** - Access [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) where they're assigned, view the process flow for those processes, see upcoming tasks on the dashboard
- **Account** - Log in with their own credentials, update their profile, view guests they're collaborating with

:::note[Template visibility for Light members]
Light members only see templates when an Administrator grants them LAUNCH permission. They still can't edit or create templates - just launch processes from them.

Light members also work well with [knowledge-only mode](/products/pro/tutorials/knowledge-only-mode/) - they can view procedures and reference SOPs without launching formal processes.
:::

:::tip[Light members vs guests]
Light members are users within your organization with their own login. [Guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) are external email addresses (customers, vendors) who only access specific tasks via email links.
:::

### What Light members can't do

- **Templates** - Can't create, edit, clone, organize into folders, import, or export [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)
- **Process control** - Can't delete running processes, change process settings, reassign tasks, or manage automated actions
- **Admin functions** - Can't invite members, access org settings, view API keys, or manage permissions for others

### Launching processes

By default, Light members can't launch processes. But Administrators can grant LAUNCH permission for specific templates:

1. Open the template's **Config** settings
2. Find the Light member who needs launch access
3. Grant them **LAUNCH** permission for that template
4. The template appears in the Light member's library with a launch button

Light members launch the process without seeing or editing the template design.

**Good use cases for Light member launching:**
- Warehouse staff starting morning safety inspections
- Receptionists launching client onboarding
- Field workers initiating incident reports
- Production line workers starting quality checks

:::tip[Organize for Light members]
Create template folders named clearly like "Daily Operations - Light Users". This helps Light members find launchable processes without clutter.
:::

### When to use Light members

**Field and frontline workers** - delivery drivers, technicians, construction crews, healthcare workers

**Contractors and partners** - vendors completing quality checks, temporary staff, project-based contractors

**Task-focused internal roles** - data entry, warehouse staff, customer service reps, reception desk

**Knowledge base users** - teams referencing [knowledge-only procedures](/products/pro/tutorials/knowledge-only-mode/) and SOPs without formal task tracking

### Role planning

1. **Audit Full members** - find people who only complete tasks, never create templates
2. **Convert task-only users** to Light member status
3. **Reserve Full member licenses** for process designers and managers
4. **Monitor usage** - track who actually creates templates versus who just executes

:::tip[Role planning example]
A 100-person company with 20 process designers and 80 field workers? Keep 20 Full member licenses for designers. Convert the 80 field workers to Light members.
:::

### Upgrading to a Full member

[Changing roles](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-can-i-change-a-members-role-in-tallyfy/) takes seconds:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Members**
2. Find the Light member
3. Click their role dropdown and select **Standard** or **Administrator**
4. Changes take effect immediately - no logout needed

The member keeps all task history and active assignments.

### Best practices

- **Write clear task instructions** - Light members can't edit templates, so descriptions need to be thorough with step-by-step guidance
- **Think mobile-first** - many Light members work from phones, so keep descriptions short and forms simple
- **Grant LAUNCH only where needed** - keep the interface focused on what each Light member actually does
- **Training is minimal** - show them how to log in, find tasks, and complete them. That's it.
