## How to change a member's role

Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Members**, click a member's name, and pick a new role from the dropdown. Only Administrators can do this - Standard and Light members can't modify roles.

### What you need
- Administrator permission level
- At least one other [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) whose role you want to change

### Available roles

Tallyfy has three [member roles](/products/pro/documenting/members/):

- **Administrator** - Full control over templates, processes, settings, and member management
- **Standard** - Can work with processes and templates based on permissions you set
- **Light** - For occasional users who only need to complete assigned [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/)

### Steps to change a role

<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Members**
2. Click the member's name - you'll see their current role displayed

4. Click **Save** to apply the change
</Steps>

The change takes effect immediately.

### When to change roles

- Promoting someone to manage the whole Tallyfy setup? Give them Administrator access
- Have a contractor who only works on specific [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) occasionally? Switch them to Light
- Team member switching departments? Update their role to match new responsibilities

You can change roles anytime. If someone needs temporary higher access, switch them back later.

### Removing members from your organization

You can't directly delete members, but you can deactivate them:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Members**
2. Click on the member's name
3. Click the button to disable their account
4. Confirm the action

Deactivated members:
- Can't log in to Tallyfy
- Don't count toward your member limit
- Keep their historical data for audit trails
- Can be reactivated anytime
