## How to change a member's role

### Requirements
- Administrator access
- At least one [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) whose role you want to change

### Available member roles

Tallyfy offers three distinct [member roles](/products/pro/documenting/members/):

- **Administrator**: Full access to all features, settings, and permissions
- **Standard**: Customizable permissions set by administrators
- **Light**: Limited access with basic [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) viewing and [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) completion capabilities

### Steps to change a role

1. Navigate to **Settings > Organization > Members**
2. Click on the profile name of the member to modify

4. Click **Save** to apply the changes

### When to change roles

- Promote a Standard member to Administrator when they need organization-wide control
- Change to Light role for occasional users who only need to complete assigned [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/)
- Adjust roles as team responsibilities evolve
