## How to change a member's role

To change a member's role in Tallyfy, go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Members**, click their name, and select the new role from the dropdown. That's it.

You'll need Administrator permissions to make this change - Standard and Light members can't modify roles.

### What you need
- Administrator permission level
- At least one other [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) whose role you want to change

### Available Member roles

Tallyfy uses three [member roles](/products/pro/documenting/members/) to control what people can do:

- **Administrator**: Full control over everything in Tallyfy - templates, processes, settings, the works
- **Standard**: Can work with processes and templates based on permissions you set
- **Light**: Perfect for occasional users who just need to complete assigned [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/)

Simple.

### Steps to change a member's role

<Steps>
1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Members**
2. Click on the member's name - you'll see their current role displayed

4. Click **Save** to apply the change
</Steps>

The change takes effect immediately. The member will see their new permissions the next time they log in.

### When you might change roles

Here's when role changes make sense:

- Someone's getting promoted? Give them Administrator access if they'll be managing the whole Tallyfy setup
- Have a contractor who only works on specific [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) occasionally? Switch them to Light - it's more cost-effective
- Team member switching departments? Update their role to match their new responsibilities

Remember: you can change roles anytime. If someone needs temporary elevated access, you can always switch them back later.

### Removing members from your organization

**Need to remove a member completely?** While you can't directly delete members, you can deactivate them:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Members**
2. Click on the member's name
3. Toggle their status to **Inactive**
4. Click **Save**

Deactivated members:
- Can't log in to Tallyfy
- Don't count toward your member limit
- Keep their historical data (for audit trails)
- Can be reactivated anytime if needed

This approach frees up space for new team members while preserving process history.
