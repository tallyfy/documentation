## How to change a member's role

### What you need
- Administrator permission level.
- At least one other [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) whose role you need to change.

### Available Member roles

Tallyfy has three main [member roles](/products/pro/documenting/members/):

- **Administrator**: Has full control over everything in Tallyfy.
- **Standard**: Has permissions set by an Administrator.
- **Light**: Has limited access, mainly for viewing basic information and completing assigned [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/).

### Steps to change a member's role

<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Members**.
2. Click on the name of the member whose role you want to change.

4. Click **Save**.
</Steps>

### When you might change roles

- Give someone the Administrator role if they need control over the whole Tallyfy account.
- Change someone to the Light role if they only need to do assigned [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) occasionally.
- Update roles whenever someone's job responsibilities change.
