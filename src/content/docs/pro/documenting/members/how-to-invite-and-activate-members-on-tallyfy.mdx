## Inviting team members and managing their activation

To invite someone to Tallyfy, click the **Invite+** button anywhere you see it and enter their email address - they'll get an invitation email to set up their account. Simple as that.

### What you'll need first
- Administrator permissions (only admins can send invites)
- An available paid [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) seat in your plan
- The email addresses of people you're inviting

### Inviting new members to your team

<Steps>
1. Find the **Invite+** button - it's everywhere in Tallyfy:
    - In the left sidebar
    - Under your name (top right corner)
    - In **Settings** > **Organization** > **Members**
    - In the **+Create** menu at the top

2. Type the person's email address.
3. Add their first and last name.
4. Pick their [Role](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-do-i-manage-member-permissions-in-tallyfy/) - Administrator or Standard works for most people.
5. *(Optional)* Write a welcome message to make it personal.

6. Hit **Send Invitation**. Done.
</Steps>

### Managing your sent invitations

Need to check on pending invites? Head to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Members** and look for anyone with "Invited" status - that's everyone who hasn't joined yet.

What if someone didn't get the email? No problem. You can resend it right from that same page. Invited the wrong person? Click **Withdraw** to cancel the invitation.

:::tip[Troubleshooting invitation delivery issues]
**Invitations not arriving?** Common solutions:
1. **Check spam/junk folders** - Have them search for emails from tallyfy.com
2. **Verify email address** - Even small typos prevent delivery
3. **Whitelist Tallyfy** - Add tallyfy.com to allowed senders in email settings
4. **Corporate firewalls** - IT may need to allow emails from noreply@tallyfy.com
5. **Resend after 24 hours** - Sometimes email servers have temporary issues
6. **Check invitation status** - Settings > Organization > Members shows if invite is pending

Still not working? Contact support with the exact email address for investigation.

### What happens on their end

Once you send the invite, here's what your new team member needs to do:

<Steps>
1. Check their email for the Tallyfy invitation.
2. Click the **Join Now** button in that email.
3. Create a strong password for their account.

<Steps>
1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Members**.
2. Find the person's name - if their status shows **Active**, you're all set.
