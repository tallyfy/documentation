## Inviting members and managing activation

Click the **Invite+** button anywhere in Tallyfy, enter an email address, and that person gets an invitation to set up their account.

### What you'll need

- Administrator permissions by default (admins can also allow Standard members to invite others via org settings)
- An available paid [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) seat in your plan
- The email addresses of people you're inviting

### Inviting new members

<Steps>
1. Find the **Invite+** button - it appears in several places:
    - In the left sidebar
    - Under your name (top right corner)
    - In **Settings** > **Organization** > **Members**
    - In the **+Create** menu at the top

2. Enter the person's email address.
3. Add their first and last name.
4. Pick their [Role](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-do-i-manage-member-permissions-in-tallyfy/) - Administrator, Standard, or Light.
5. Write a welcome message (required, up to 5,000 characters).

6. Click **Send Invitation**.
</Steps>

:::note
Non-admin members can't assign the Administrator role when inviting someone. Only admins can grant admin access.

### Managing sent invitations

Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Members** and look for anyone with "Invited" status - that's everyone who hasn't joined yet.

You can resend an invitation right from that page. Invited the wrong person? Click **Withdraw** to cancel it.

:::tip[Troubleshooting invitation delivery]
**Invitations not arriving?** Common fixes:
1. **Check spam/junk folders** - Search for emails from tallyfy.com
2. **Verify the email address** - Even small typos prevent delivery
3. **Whitelist Tallyfy** - Add tallyfy.com to allowed senders
4. **Corporate firewalls** - IT may need to allow emails from noreply@tallyfy.com
5. **Resend after 24 hours** - Email servers sometimes have temporary issues
6. **Check invitation status** - **Settings** > **Organization** > **Members** shows if the invite is still pending

Still stuck? Contact support with the exact email address.

### The activation process

Here's what your new team member does after receiving the invite:

<Steps>
1. Open the Tallyfy invitation email.
2. Click the **Join Now** button.
3. Create a password for their account.

</Steps>

### Verifying someone joined

<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Members**.
2. Find the person's name - if their status shows **Active**, they're in.
