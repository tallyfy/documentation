## Removing members from your organization

To remove a member from Tallyfy, navigate to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Members**, click their name, and select **Deactivate Account** at the bottom of their profile. The member loses access immediately, and you'll decide what happens to their current tasks.

### What you need
- Administrator permission level
- The name of the [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) you want to remove

### Removing a member

Here's how to permanently deactivate someone's account:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Members**.
2. Click on the name of the member you want to remove.
3. Scroll down to the bottom of their profile page.
4. Click **Deactivate Account**.

That's it. The deactivation happens instantly.

### Choosing what happens to their tasks

When you deactivate a [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/), you'll need to decide what happens to their current [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/). You've got two options:

1. **Reassign their tasks** (recommended):
   - Pick other active members to take over the work
   - Choose specific tasks or reassign everything from certain [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)
   ![Conflict resolution interface](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-conflict-resolution-example.png)

2. **Leave tasks unassigned**:
   - Select **Deactivate without reassigning their tasks**
   - Tasks become unassigned - you'll need to reassign them manually later
   - This works well if you want to redistribute tasks individually

### What happens after removing a member

Once you click that deactivate button, here's what happens:

- Their account gets deactivated instantly
- They lose access to your Tallyfy organization immediately  
- Their paid seat becomes available for new team members
- Tallyfy logs who performed the deactivation and when (you can check this in the member's Activity section)

:::warning[Important: Check Public Kick-off Forms First!]
**Wait - before you deactivate anyone, check if they created or are listed as the inviter for any templates used in public kick-off forms. You'll want to update those forms first.**

Here's why: Deactivating a [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) can sometimes break public [kick-off forms](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/) if that member was connected to them. Let me explain what happens:

- **Scenario 1: Member was the *inviter* for a form (but didn't create the template)**
    - Tallyfy automatically switches the inviter to whoever created the template
    - Public sharing stays ON - no action needed from you
- **Scenario 2: Member was the *creator* of the template used for a public form**
    - Tallyfy automatically turns OFF public sharing for that form
    - The public link stops working (yes, immediately)
    - To fix this, an Administrator needs to turn public sharing back ON and choose a new member to associate with the form

### Checking deactivation history

Need to find out who deactivated a member? Here's how:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Members**
2. Find the deactivated member's name (you might need to filter the list)
3. Check the **Activity** section at the bottom of their profile page

The activity log shows exactly who performed the deactivation and when it happened.
