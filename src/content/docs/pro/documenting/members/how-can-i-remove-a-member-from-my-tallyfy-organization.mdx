### Conflict resolution options

When removing a member, you'll need to address any tasks assigned to them:

1. **Reassign their tasks** (recommended):
   - Select active members to take over the removed member's tasks
   - Choose which tasks or templates to reassign

2. **Deactivate without reassigning**:
   - Click **Deactivate without reassigning their tasks**
   - Tasks will remain unassigned until manually addressed
   - Use this option when you plan to reassign tasks individually later

### Post-removal actions

After removing a member:
- Their account becomes inactive immediately
- They can no longer log in to your organization
- Their license becomes available for a new member
- A record of who removed the member and when is stored in the Activity section

### Tracking member removal history

To see who removed a member:
1. Navigate to **Settings > Organization > Members**
2. Find the former member's name
3. Check the **Activity** section at the bottom of their profile
