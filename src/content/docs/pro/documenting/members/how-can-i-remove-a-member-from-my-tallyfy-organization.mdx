## Removing a member from your organization

### Requirements
- Administrator access
- The name of the [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) you want to remove

### Steps to remove a Member

1. Navigate to **Settings > Organization > Members**
2. Click on the name of the member you want to remove
3. Scroll down to the bottom of their profile
4. Click **Deactivate Account**

### Conflict resolution options

When removing a [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/), you'll need to address any [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) assigned to them:

1. **Reassign their tasks** (recommended):
   - Select active members to take over the removed member's tasks
   - Choose which tasks or [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) to reassign
   ![Conflict resolution interface](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-conflict-resolution-example.png)

2. **Deactivate without reassigning**:
   - Click **Deactivate without reassigning their tasks**
   - Tasks will remain unassigned until manually addressed
   - Use this option when you plan to reassign tasks individually later

### Post-removal actions

After removing a member:
- Their account becomes inactive immediately
- They can no longer log in to your organization
- Their license becomes available for a new [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/)
- A record of who removed the member and when is stored in the Activity section

:::warning[Public kick-off forms]
Deactivating a [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) can affect public [kick-off forms](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/) associated with that member:

- If the deactivated member is not the template creator but is set as the inviter for a public form, Tallyfy will automatically update it with the template creator name and keep public sharing ON
- If the deactivated member is the template creator of a public form, Tallyfy will turn OFF public sharing and make the copied URL invalid until public sharing is turned ON again with a newly selected member

To avoid disruption, check if the [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) is associated with any public [kick-off forms](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/) before deactivation and reassign them if necessary.

### Tracking Member removal history

To see who removed a member:
1. Navigate to **Settings > Organization > Members**
2. Find the former member's name
3. Check the **Activity** section at the bottom of their profile
