title: How to remove a member
---

## Removing members from your organization

To remove a member from Tallyfy, go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Members**, click their name, and select **Deactivate Account** at the bottom of their profile. Access is revoked immediately, and you'll decide what happens to their current tasks.

### What you need
- Administrator permission level
- The name of the [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) you want to remove

### Removing a member

1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Members**.
2. Click the member's name.
3. Scroll to the bottom of their profile page.
4. Click **Deactivate Account**.

Deactivation happens instantly.

### Choosing what happens to their tasks

When you deactivate a [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/), you'll decide what happens to their current [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/). Two options:

1. **Reassign their tasks** (recommended):
   - Pick other active members to take over the work
   - Choose specific tasks or reassign everything from certain [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)

2. **Leave tasks unassigned**:
   - Select **Deactivate without reassigning their tasks**
   - Tasks become unassigned - you'll need to reassign them manually later

### What happens after deactivation

- They lose access to your Tallyfy organization immediately
- Their paid seat[^1] opens up for new team members
- Tallyfy records who performed the deactivation and when (visible in the member's Activity section)

:::warning[Check public kick-off forms first]
Before deactivating anyone, check if they're the inviter or creator for any [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) used in public [kick-off forms](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/)[^2].

- **Member was the *inviter* (but didn't create the template)** - Tallyfy automatically switches the inviter to the template creator. Public sharing stays ON.
- **Member was the *creator* of the template** - Tallyfy may turn OFF public sharing for that form, breaking the public link immediately. An Administrator would need to turn public sharing back ON and pick a new member to associate with the form.
:::

### Checking deactivation history

1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Members**
2. Find the deactivated member's name (you may need to filter the list)
3. Check the **Activity** section at the bottom of their profile page

The activity log shows who deactivated the member and when.
