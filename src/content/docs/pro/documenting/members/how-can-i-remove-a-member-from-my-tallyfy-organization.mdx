## How to remove a member from your organization

### What you need
- Administrator permission level.
- The name of the [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) you want to remove.

### Steps to remove (deactivate) a Member

When you remove a member, you are deactivating their account.
1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Members**.
2. Click on the name of the member you want to remove.
3. Scroll down to the bottom of their profile page.
4. Click **Deactivate Account**.

### Choosing what happens to their tasks

When you deactivate a [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/), Tallyfy asks what to do with any [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) currently assigned to them:

1. **Reassign their tasks** (Recommended):
   - Choose other active members to take over the tasks.
   - You can select which specific tasks or all tasks from certain [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) to reassign.

2. **Deactivate without reassigning**:
   - Choose the option **Deactivate without reassigning their tasks**.
   - The tasks will become unassigned. Someone will need to assign them to another person later.
   - Use this if you plan to reassign tasks one by one later.

### What happens after removing a member

- Their account is immediately deactivated.
- They cannot log into your Tallyfy organization anymore.
- The paid member seat they used becomes available for someone else.
- The system keeps a record of who deactivated the member and when (viewable in the member's profile Activity section).

:::warning[Important: Check Public Kick-off Forms First!]
**Before deactivating a member, check if they created or are listed as the inviter for any templates used in public kick-off forms. Update those forms first to avoid problems.**

Deactivating a [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) can sometimes break public [kick-off forms](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/) if that member was connected to them:

- **Scenario 1: Member was the *inviter* for a form (but not the template creator)**
    - Tallyfy will automatically switch the inviter to be the person who created the template.
    - Public sharing for the form will stay ON.
- **Scenario 2: Member was the *creator* of the template used for a public form**
    - Tallyfy will automatically turn OFF public sharing for that form.
    - The public link for the form will stop working.
    - To fix this, an Administrator needs to turn public sharing ON again and choose a new member to be associated with the form.

### Seeing who removed a Member

If you need to check who deactivated a member:
1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Members**.
2. Find the deactivated member's name (you might need to filter the list).
3. Check the **Activity** section at the bottom of their profile page.
