## Removing members from your organization

### What you need
- Administrator permission level.
- The name of the [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) you want to remove.

### Removing a member

Removing a member deactivates their account permanently.
1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Members**.
2. Click on the name of the member you want to remove.
3. Scroll down to the bottom of their profile page.
4. Click **Deactivate Account**.

### Choosing what happens to their tasks

When you deactivate a [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/), you'll need to decide what happens to their current [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/):

1. **Reassign their tasks** (recommended):
   - Pick other active members to take over their work.
   - Choose specific tasks or reassign everything from certain [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).

2. **Leave tasks unassigned**:
   - Select **Deactivate without reassigning their tasks**.
   - Tasks become unassigned and need manual reassignment later.
   - Choose this option if you want to redistribute tasks individually.

### What happens after removing a member

- Account gets deactivated instantly.
- They lose access to your Tallyfy organization immediately.
- Their paid seat becomes available for new team members.
- Tallyfy logs who performed the deactivation and when (check the member's Activity section).

:::warning[Important: Check Public Kick-off Forms First!]
**Before deactivating a member, check if they created or are listed as the inviter for any templates used in public kick-off forms. Update those forms first to avoid problems.**

Deactivating a [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) can sometimes break public [kick-off forms](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/) if that member was connected to them:

- **Scenario 1: Member was the *inviter* for a form (but not the template creator)**
    - Tallyfy will automatically switch the inviter to be the person who created the template.
    - Public sharing for the form will stay ON.
- **Scenario 2: Member was the *creator* of the template used for a public form**
    - Tallyfy will automatically turn OFF public sharing for that form.
    - The public link for the form will stop working.
    - To fix this, an Administrator needs to turn public sharing ON again and choose a new member to be associated with the form.
:::

### Checking deactivation history

If you need to check who deactivated a member:
1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Members**.
2. Find the deactivated member's name (you might need to filter the list).
3. Check the **Activity** section at the bottom of their profile page.
