## What are members in Tallyfy?

A [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) is a paid-for and licensed user in Tallyfy. Members are mostly used for employees within your organization.

A member can have only one of three [roles](/products/pro/documenting/members/):

- **Administrator**. An Administrator role can see and do absolutely everything, no matter what permissions are assigned. For this reason - be careful about who you assign the "Administrator" role to.
- **Standard**. A Standard role is for most employees in a company and you can configure and customize permissions that will apply to this role.
- **Light**. A Light role is just like Standard role, except that they cannot _edit_ or _create_ any [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) at all. However, they can comment on steps on templates if they have improvement ideas. You could apply Light role for anyone in your company that will never need to create or edit templates.

Two important notes:

* On our [pricing](/products/pro/pricing/) page there's something called a _Full_ role and that specifically means either the _Administrator_ or the _Standard_ role.
* [Pricing](/products/pro/pricing/) for members in _Light_ role is **significantly less** than for members in _Full_ roles.
