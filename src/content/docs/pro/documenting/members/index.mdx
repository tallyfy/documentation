## What are members in Tallyfy?

Members are people in your organization with paid Tallyfy access - your employees, contractors, or anyone who needs to work on business processes and workflows regularly.

Here's the key difference: Members have full account access and count toward your subscription limits. Guests? They're external users with limited access.

### The three member roles

You'll assign each member one of three roles. Let's break them down:

- **Administrator**: Complete control over everything in Tallyfy - settings, members, system configuration. Be careful who gets this role since it gives unlimited access.
- **Standard**: The most common role for regular employees who need full workflow capabilities. Admins can customize their specific permissions based on job needs.
- **Light**: Can complete tasks and give feedback on processes, but can't create or edit templates. Perfect for people who follow processes rather than design them.

:::tip[Understanding Member Roles Through Key Card Security Analogy]
Visualize Tallyfy roles as sophisticated key card access levels for a secure office building:

- **Administrator:** Has the **master key card** with universal access. Can enter all areas, modify security settings (equivalent to changing locks), and determine access rights for other personnel. Reserve this role exclusively for highly trusted individuals.
- **Standard:** Holds a **departmental employee key card**. Accesses designated work areas and specific rooms required for job functions (process execution, potential template editing if authorized), while restricted from high-security areas (organizational settings).
- **Light:** Carries a **task-focused access key card**. Enters assigned work areas to complete specific job responsibilities (task completion, feedback provision) but can't access design areas (template creation or editing).

### Pricing by role

Simple:

- **Full roles**: Administrator and Standard roles both count as "Full" members for billing
- **Light roles**: Cost significantly less than Full roles, making them perfect for team members who just need to complete tasks
