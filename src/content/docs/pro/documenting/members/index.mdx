## What are members in Tallyfy?

Members are people in your organization with Tallyfy access - employees, contractors, or anyone who works on processes regularly. Unlike [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/), members have full account access and count toward your subscription limits[^1].

### The three member roles

Each member gets one of three roles:

- **Administrator** - Full control over settings, members, and system configuration. Only give this to trusted people.
- **Standard** - The most common role. Full workflow capabilities with specific permissions that admins can customize per person.
- **Light** - Can complete assigned tasks and give feedback, but can't create or edit templates. Ideal for people who follow processes rather than design them.

:::tip[Think of roles like key card access levels]
- **Administrator:** Master key card - enters all areas, changes security settings, controls who gets access.
- **Standard:** Department key card - accesses work areas and rooms needed for their job, but not org-wide settings.
- **Light:** Task-only key card - enters assigned areas to complete work, but can't access template design areas.

### Role categories

- **Full roles** - Administrator and Standard both count as "Full" members for billing purposes
- **Light roles** - For team members who only need to complete tasks, without template creation access
