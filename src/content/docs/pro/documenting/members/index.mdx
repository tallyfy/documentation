## Understanding members in Tallyfy

Members are people in your organization with paid Tallyfy access. Think of them as your employees, contractors, or anyone who needs to work on business processes and workflows.

Members have full account access and count toward your subscription limits. This separates them from guests, who are external users with limited access.

### The three member roles

Every member gets one of three roles that control what they can do in Tallyfy:

- **Administrator**: Complete control over everything in Tallyfy - settings, members, system configuration. Be careful who gets this role since it gives unlimited access.
- **Standard**: The most common role for regular employees who need full workflow capabilities. Admins can customize their specific permissions based on job needs.
- **Light**: Can complete tasks and give feedback on processes, but can't create or edit templates. Perfect for people who follow processes rather than design them.

This role system gives everyone the right level of access without compromising security or workflow efficiency.

:::tip[Understanding Member Roles Through Key Card Security Analogy]
Visualize Tallyfy<sup>Â®</sup> roles as sophisticated key card access levels for a secure office building:

- **Administrator:** Has the **master key card** with universal access. Can enter all areas, modify security settings (equivalent to changing locks), and determine access rights for other personnel. Reserve this role exclusively for highly trusted individuals.
- **Standard:** Holds a **departmental employee key card**. Accesses designated work areas and specific rooms required for job functions (process execution, potential template editing if authorized), while restricted from high-security areas (organizational settings).
- **Light:** Carries a **task-focused access key card**. Enters assigned work areas to complete specific job responsibilities (task completion, feedback provision) but can't access design areas (template creation or editing).

### How pricing works for different roles

- **Full roles**: Administrator and Standard roles both count as "Full" members for billing
- **Light roles**: Cost significantly less than Full roles, making them perfect for team members who just need to complete tasks

This pricing structure helps you save money by matching role costs to what people actually need to do.
