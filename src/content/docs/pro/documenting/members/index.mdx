### What are members in Tallyfy?

A [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) is a user within your organization who has a paid license for Tallyfy. Think of them usually as your employees.

A member must have one of these three [roles](/products/pro/documenting/members/):

- **Administrator**: Can see and do everything in Tallyfy. They have full control over settings and permissions. Be careful who you give this role to.
- **Standard**: The most common role for employees. Administrators can customize what Standard members are allowed to do.
- **Light**: Similar to Standard, but **cannot** create or edit process [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). They can still complete tasks and comment on template steps with improvement ideas. This role is good for people who only need to follow processes, not build them.

:::tip[Understanding Roles with a Key Card Analogy]
Imagine Tallyfy roles are like key cards for an office:

- **Administrator:** Has the **master key card**. Can go anywhere, change settings (like changing locks), and decide who gets other keys. Give this role only to trusted people.
- **Standard:** Has a **general employee key card**. Can access work areas and specific rooms needed for their job (use processes, maybe edit some templates if allowed), but not high-security areas (like organization settings).
- **Light:** Has a **limited access key card**. Can go into assigned work areas to do their job (complete tasks, comment) but cannot get into the design rooms (cannot create or edit templates).
:::

Two important notes about roles and pricing:

*   On our [pricing page](/products/pro/pricing/), the term **Full** role means either the *Administrator* or the *Standard* role.
*   The [price](/products/pro/pricing/) for members with the **Light** role is much lower than for members with **Full** roles.
