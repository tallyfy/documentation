## How do members work in Tallyfy速 for organizational workflow management?

A member in Tallyfy represents a licensed user within your organization who possesses a paid Tallyfy速 license. Members typically correspond to your employees, contractors, or other authorized organizational personnel who require workflow access to complete business processes.

Members form the core user base of your Tallyfy implementation and are distinguished from guests (external users) by having full account access and being counted against your subscription licensing.

### What member roles does Tallyfy provide for organizational access control?

Every member must be assigned one of three strategic roles that determine their access level and capabilities within your Tallyfy organization:

- **Administrator Role**: Possesses complete access and control over all Tallyfy速 functionality including organizational settings, member management, and system configuration. Exercise caution when assigning this powerful role as it provides unrestricted access.
- **Standard Role**: The most frequently assigned role for regular employees who need comprehensive workflow capabilities. Administrators can customize and configure specific permissions for Standard members based on organizational needs and job responsibilities.
- **Light Role**: Similar capabilities to Standard members but cannot create or edit process templates. Light members can complete assigned tasks and provide improvement feedback on template steps. This role suits individuals who execute processes rather than design them.

This role-based approach ensures appropriate access control while maintaining workflow efficiency across different organizational levels.

:::tip[Understanding Member Roles Through Key Card Security Analogy]
Visualize Tallyfy<sup>速</sup> roles as sophisticated key card access levels for a secure office building:

- **Administrator:** Possesses the **master key card** with universal access. Can enter all areas, modify security settings (equivalent to changing locks), and determine access rights for other personnel. Reserve this role exclusively for highly trusted individuals.
- **Standard:** Holds a **departmental employee key card**. Accesses designated work areas and specific rooms required for job functions (process execution, potential template editing if authorized), while restricted from high-security areas (organizational settings).
- **Light:** Carries a **task-focused access key card**. Enters assigned work areas to complete specific job responsibilities (task completion, feedback provision) but cannot access design areas (template creation or editing).

### What pricing considerations apply to different member roles?

*   **Full Role Definition**: On the pricing page, the term "Full" role encompasses both Administrator and Standard role designations for billing purposes.
*   **Light Role Cost Advantage**: The pricing for members with Light roles is significantly lower than for members with Full roles, enabling cost-effective scaling for task-focused users who don't need template creation capabilities.

This pricing structure allows organizations to optimize costs by assigning appropriate role levels based on actual user needs and responsibilities.
