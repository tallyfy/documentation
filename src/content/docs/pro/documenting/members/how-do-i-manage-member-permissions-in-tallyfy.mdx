## How to manage member permissions

### Requirements
- Administrator [role](/products/pro/documenting/members/)
- Standard [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) in your organization

### Understanding permission types

Administrators can control what Standard members can do across five key permission areas:

1. **Template editing** - Whether a Standard member can modify specific [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)
2. **Template viewing** - Whether a Standard member can see specific templates
3. **[Process launching](/products/pro/launching/)** - Whether a Standard member can start [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) from specific templates
4. **Process access** - Whether a Standard member can find and view specific active processes
5. **[Member invitations](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-to-invite-and-activate-members-on-tallyfy/)** - Whether a Standard member can [invite](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-to-invite-and-activate-members-on-tallyfy/) other members

### Setting Template-level permissions

<Steps>
1. Navigate to the template you want to manage
2. Click **Config** in the template editor
3. Select the **Permissions** tab
4. Enable or disable permissions for specific Standard members
5. Click **Save**
</Steps>

### Setting Process-level permissions

<Steps>
1. Select the active [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) from the Processes sidebar
2. Click **Settings**
3. Navigate to the **Permissions** section
4. Adjust access settings for Standard members
5. Click **Save**
</Steps>

### Best practices for permission management

- Limit [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) editing permissions to prevent accidental changes
- Grant [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) viewing access to all members who need visibility
- Reserve [launch](/products/pro/launching/) permissions for trained team members
- Review permissions periodically as team roles change
- Create permission templates for different user groups
