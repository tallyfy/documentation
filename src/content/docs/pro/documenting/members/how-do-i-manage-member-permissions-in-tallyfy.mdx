## How to control what team members can do

Go to any template's **Config** settings or a running process's **Settings** panel, then adjust the permission checkboxes for each Standard member.

### What you need
- Administrator [role](/products/pro/documenting/members/)
- Standard [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) whose permissions you want to manage

### Types of permissions

As an Administrator, you control exactly what Standard members can and can't do. Five permission areas apply per template:

1. **Edit** - Can this person change specific [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)? One wrong edit affects every future process.
2. **Read** - Can they see specific templates in the library?
3. **[Launch](/products/pro/launching/)** - Can they start new [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) from specific templates?
4. **View processes** - Can they find and view running processes from this template?
5. **Duplicate** - Can they duplicate this template?

### Setting permissions for a specific template

<Steps>
1. Open the template you want to manage
2. Click **Config** while editing the template
3. Go to the **Permissions** tab
4. Check or uncheck boxes for specific Standard members or groups
5. Click **Save**
</Steps>

:::note[Hiding templates from users]
To completely hide a template from Standard or Light users[^1], you must restrict **all** template-level permissions - Edit, Read, and Launch at minimum. If even one box is checked, the template stays visible in their library.

### Setting permissions for a running process

You can hide specific running processes from certain team members.
<Steps>
1. Find the running [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) in the Processes list (sidebar)
2. Click **Settings** for that process
3. Go to the **Permissions** section
4. Adjust who can see this running process
5. Click **Save**
</Steps>

### Tips for managing permissions

- **Template editing is powerful** - one accidental change to a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) affects every future process launched from it. Only give this to people who understand your workflows.
- **Don't over-restrict process visibility**. If someone needs to collaborate on running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), they need view access. Being too restrictive creates bottlenecks.
- **[Process launching](/products/pro/launching/) needs training**. Make sure people understand a workflow before giving them launch permissions.
- **Review permissions regularly** - especially after promotions, role changes, or department transfers.
- **Use groups, not individuals**. Permissions can be assigned per group, which is much easier than managing person by person.
