## How to control what team members can do

To manage member permissions in Tallyfy, go to any template's **Config** settings or a running process's **Settings** panel, then adjust the permission checkboxes for each Standard member. That's it.

### What you need
- Administrator [role](/products/pro/documenting/members/)
- Standard [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) whose permissions you want to manage

### Understanding the types of permissions

Here's the thing - as an Administrator, you're in charge of exactly what Standard members can and can't do. Five key areas need your attention:

1. **Editing Templates**: Should this person be able to change specific process [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)? (Think carefully - one wrong edit can mess up everyone's workflow)
2. **Viewing Templates**: Can they see specific templates in the library?
3. **[Starting Processes](/products/pro/launching/)**: Are they trained enough to launch new [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) from specific templates?
4. **Accessing Processes**: Can they find and view processes that are already running?
5. **[Inviting Members](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-to-invite-and-activate-members-on-tallyfy/)**: Do you trust them to [invite](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-to-invite-and-activate-members-on-tallyfy/) new people to your Tallyfy organization?

### Setting permissions for a specific Template

Want to control who can edit, view, or launch a template? Here's how.
<Steps>
1. Go to the template you want to manage permissions for
2. Click **Config** while editing the template
3. Go to the **Permissions** tab
4. Check or uncheck the boxes to give or remove permission for specific Standard members
5. Click **Save**
</Steps>

:::note[Hiding templates from users]
Here's something that trips people up: if you want to completely hide a template from Standard or Light users, you can't just remove one permission. You need to restrict **ALL THREE** - EDIT, READ, and LAUNCH. Leave even one box checked? That template stays visible in their library. Sneaky, right?

### Setting permissions for a specific running Process

Now let's talk about processes that are already running. You might need to hide sensitive processes from certain team members - here's how to do that.
<Steps>
1. Find the running [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) in the Processes list (sidebar)
2. Click **Settings** for that process
3. Go to the **Permissions** section
4. Adjust who can see this specific running process
5. Click **Save**
</Steps>

### Tips for managing permissions

After helping hundreds of companies set up their permissions, here's what works:

- **Template editing is powerful** - and dangerous. One accidental change to a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) affects every future process launched from it. Only give this permission to people who really understand your workflows.
- **Process visibility matters**. If someone needs to collaborate on running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), they need view access. Don't be too restrictive here - it creates bottlenecks.
- **[Process launching](/products/pro/launching/) requires training**. I've seen chaos when untrained folks start launching complex workflows. Make sure people understand the process before giving them launch permissions.
- **People change roles**. Set a quarterly reminder to review permissions - especially after promotions, role changes, or department transfers. Takes 10 minutes. Saves headaches.
- **Think in groups, not individuals**. Got a sales team? Marketing department? Create standard permission sets for each group. Much easier than managing person by person.
