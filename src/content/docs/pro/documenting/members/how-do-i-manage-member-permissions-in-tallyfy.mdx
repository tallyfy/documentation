## How to administrate permissions in Tallyfy

Welcome to Tallyfy's help article! Here, we'll guide you through everything you need to know about member permissions in Tallyfy, in the simplest way possible.

In Tallyfy, we have two types of members: Admin and Standard. Not sure what each role means? Just click on "Admin" or "Standard" above to find out!

Now, let's talk about the types of permissions that can be set for a Standard member. As an admin member, you get to decide if a Standard member can:

1. Edit a specific template
2. Read a specific template
3. Launch a process using a specific template
4. Find and access a specific process that was launched using a specific template
5. Invite other Standard members

Impressive, right? You have full control over what your Standard members can do in Tallyfy!

To set these member permissions, follow these simple steps:

A. Apply template restrictions by going to the template editor and clicking on "Config." Easy peasy!
