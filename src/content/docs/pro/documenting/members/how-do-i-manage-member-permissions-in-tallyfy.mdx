## How to manage member permissions

### What you need
- Administrator [role](/products/pro/documenting/members/)
- Standard [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) whose permissions you want to manage

### Understanding the types of permissions

Administrators control what Standard members can do in Tallyfy. There are five main areas you can control permissions for:

1. **Editing Templates**: Can this Standard member change specific process [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)?
2. **Viewing Templates**: Can this Standard member see specific templates in the library?
3. **[Starting Processes](/products/pro/launching/)**: Can this Standard member start new [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) using specific templates?
4. **Accessing Processes**: Can this Standard member find and view specific processes that are already running?
5. **[Inviting Members](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-to-invite-and-activate-members-on-tallyfy/)**: Can this Standard member [invite](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-to-invite-and-activate-members-on-tallyfy/) other people to join Tallyfy?

### Setting permissions for a specific Template

You control who can edit, view, or launch from a specific template.
<Steps>
1. Go to the template you want to manage permissions for
2. Click **Config** while editing the template
3. Go to the **Permissions** tab
4. Check or uncheck the boxes to give or remove permission for specific Standard members
5. Click **Save**
</Steps>

:::note[Hiding templates from users]
To completely hide a template from Standard or Light users in the templates library view, you must restrict **ALL THREE** permissions for that template: EDIT, READ, and LAUNCH. If any single permission is allowed, the template will still appear in their templates library.

### Setting permissions for a specific running Process

You control who can see a specific process that is already running.
<Steps>
1. Find the running [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) in the Processes list (sidebar)
2. Click **Settings** for that process
3. Go to the **Permissions** section
4. Adjust who can see this specific running process
5. Click **Save**
</Steps>

### Tips for managing permissions

- Be careful about who can edit [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) to avoid mistakes
- Give access to view running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) to everyone who needs to see them
- Only let trained team members [start (launch)](/products/pro/launching/) new processes
- Check permissions regularly, especially when people change jobs
- Consider setting up standard permission sets if you have different groups of users with similar needs
