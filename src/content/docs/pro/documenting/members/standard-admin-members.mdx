## Comparing Administrator and Standard member roles

Tallyfy has two main paid [member roles](/products/pro/documenting/members/) with different levels of access and things they can do: Administrator and Standard. (There is also a Light role, explained elsewhere).

### Administrator role

Administrators have full control over your company's Tallyfy account. They can do pretty much everything.

#### What Administrators can do
- **Account Settings:**
  - Change [billing](/products/pro/settings/billing/) info and subscription plans.
  - Update [organization details](/products/pro/settings/org-settings/how-can-i-update-my-organization-details/).
  - See and manage all [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) and [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).

- **People Management:**
  - [Invite new members](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-to-invite-and-activate-members-on-tallyfy/).
  - Set permissions for Standard members.
  - Edit member profiles.
  - Remove members.
  - View activity history.

- **Process Control:**
  - Create, edit, and see all process [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).
  - Decide who can access specific templates and running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).
  - Delete old, archived templates.
  - Manage all parts of running processes.

#### How to find Administrators
To see who has the Administrator role:
1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Members**.
2. Look for people listed with the **Administrator** role.

### Standard role

Standard members have fewer permissions than Administrators. Their access focuses on doing daily work using Tallyfy, not managing the whole account.

#### What Standard members can do (if allowed by an Admin)
- **Working with Templates:**
  - Create, edit, and see the [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) they have permission for.
  - Organize templates into folders.
  - Import templates.

- **Working with Others:**
  - [Invite](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-to-invite-and-activate-members-on-tallyfy/) other Standard members (if an Admin allows it).
  - See the list of members and [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) in the organization.
  - Use shared tags and text [snippets](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/).
  - View the [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) and email history of other members.

- **Other Access:**
  - See the organization's [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) key.
  - Update the company logo and branding settings.

#### What Standard members cannot do
Standard members generally cannot:
- Change who can access templates or running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).
- Delete archived templates.
- See or change member profiles or organization settings.
- View or change billing information or subscription plans.
