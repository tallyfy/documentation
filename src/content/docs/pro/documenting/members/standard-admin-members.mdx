## Comparing Administrator and Standard member roles

Tallyfy has two main paid [member roles](/products/pro/documenting/members/) with different levels of access and things they can do: Administrator and Standard. (There is also a Light role, explained elsewhere).

### Quick cost comparison: Full vs Light members

**Full members** (Administrator and Standard roles) have complete access to create templates and execute tasks. **Light members** can only complete assigned tasks - they cannot create or edit templates.

:::tip[Save 90% on member costs]
Light members cost approximately 90% less than Full members. Assign Light member licenses to users who only need to complete tasks (like warehouse staff, field workers, or external contractors). Reserve Full member licenses for process designers and managers who create workflows.

### Administrator role

Administrators have full control over your company's Tallyfy account. They can do pretty much everything.

#### What Administrators can do
- **Account Settings:**
  - Change [billing](/products/pro/settings/billing/) info and subscription plans.
  - Update [organization details](/products/pro/settings/org-settings/how-can-i-update-my-organization-details/).
  - See and manage all [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) and [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).

- **People Management:**
  - [Invite new members](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-to-invite-and-activate-members-on-tallyfy/).
  - Set permissions for Standard members.
  - Edit member profiles.
  - Remove members.
  - View activity history.

- **Process Control:**
  - Create, edit, and see all process [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).
  - Decide who can access specific templates and running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).
  - Delete old, archived templates.
  - Manage all parts of running processes.

#### How to find Administrators
To see who has the Administrator role:
1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Members**.
2. Look for people listed with the **Administrator** role.

### Standard role

Standard members have fewer permissions than Administrators. Their access focuses on doing daily work using Tallyfy, not managing the whole account.

#### What Standard members can do (if allowed by an Admin)
- **Working with Templates:**
  - Create, edit, and see the [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) they have permission for.
  - Launch processes from templates where they have been granted LAUNCH permission.
  - Organize templates into folders.
  - Import templates.

:::note[Template visibility and permissions]
Templates appear in the "Templates" library for Standard and Light members unless **ALL THREE** permissions (EDIT, READ, and LAUNCH) are restricted. To completely hide a template from these users, administrators must remove all three permissions for those specific templates.

**Important**: New templates have no default permissions for Standard members. Administrators must explicitly grant permissions (EDIT, READ, and/or LAUNCH) for Standard members to interact with new templates.
:::

- **Working with Others:**
  - [Invite](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-to-invite-and-activate-members-on-tallyfy/) other Standard members (if an Admin allows it).
  - See the list of members and [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) in the organization.
  - Use shared tags and text [snippets](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/).
  - View the [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) and email history of other members.

- **Other Access:**
  - See the organization's [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) key.
  - Update the company logo and branding settings.

#### What Standard members cannot do
Standard members generally cannot:
- Change who can access templates or running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).
- Delete archived templates.
- See or change member profiles or organization settings.
- View or change billing information or subscription plans.

### When to use each member type

**Assign Administrator role to**:
- Company executives who need full system control
- IT administrators managing integrations and security
- Operations managers overseeing all workflows
- HR leaders managing user access and permissions

**Assign Standard (Full member) role to**:
- Department heads creating team workflows
- Process improvement specialists designing templates
- Team leads who launch and monitor processes
- Quality assurance staff updating procedures

**Assign Light member role to**:
- Field service technicians completing checklists
- Warehouse staff processing shipments
- Customer service reps following scripts
- External contractors doing specific tasks
- Part-time employees with limited responsibilities

:::note[Light member limitations]
Light members can only see templates if an Administrator has given them LAUNCH permission. They cannot create, edit, or organize templates. This focused access makes Light members perfect for task execution roles at much lower cost vs. Full members.
