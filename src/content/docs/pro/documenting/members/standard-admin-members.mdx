## Comparing Administrator and Standard member roles

Tallyfy gives you two main paid [member roles](/products/pro/documenting/members/) - Administrator and Standard. Each role comes with different access levels and capabilities. (There's also a Light role, which we'll touch on below).

### Quick cost comparison: Full vs Light members

Here's the deal: **Full members** (that's Administrator and Standard roles) can create templates and execute tasks. **Light members**? They're limited to completing assigned tasks - no creating or editing templates for them.

:::tip[Save on member costs]
Light members cost significantly less than Full members. Smart move? Give Light member licenses to folks who just need to complete tasks (think warehouse staff, field workers, external contractors). Save those Full member licenses for your process designers and managers who actually create workflows. Visit our [pricing page](https://tallyfy.com/pricing/) for current rates.

### Administrator role

Administrators get the keys to the kingdom. They control everything in your company's Tallyfy account.

#### What Administrators can do

Let's break down their powers:

- **Account Settings:**
  - Change [billing](/products/pro/settings/billing/) info and subscription plans
  - Update [organization details](/products/pro/settings/org-settings/how-can-i-update-my-organization-details/)
  - Configure custom SMTP settings for organization emails
  - Manage organization logo and custom branding
  - Configure SAML/SSO settings (with support assistance)
  - View and manage all [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) and [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)

- **People Management:**
  - [Invite new members](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-to-invite-and-activate-members-on-tallyfy/) to join your team
  - Set permissions for Standard members (deciding what they can and can't do)
  - Edit member profiles
  - Remove members when needed
  - Check activity history - see who's been doing what

- **Process Control:**
  - Create, edit, and view all process [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)
  - Control who gets access to specific templates and running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)
  - Permanently delete templates and processes (not just archive them)
  - Pin important templates for organization-wide visibility
  - Manage every aspect of running processes

#### How to find Administrators

Want to know who the Administrators are? Simple.

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Members**
2. Look for anyone with the **Administrator** role label

### Standard role

Standard members work with more limited permissions. They're focused on getting daily work done in Tallyfy - not managing the entire account.

#### What Standard members can do (if allowed by an Admin)

Here's where it gets interesting. Standard members can do quite a bit, but only if an Administrator gives them permission:

- **Working with Templates:**
  - Create, edit, and view [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) they've been given access to
  - Launch processes from templates (but only when they have LAUNCH permission)
  - Organize templates into folders for better structure
  - Import templates from other sources

:::note[Template visibility and permissions]
Here's something that trips people up: Templates show up in the "Templates" library for Standard and Light members unless **ALL THREE** permissions (EDIT, READ, and LAUNCH) are removed. Want to hide a template completely? Administrators need to remove all three permissions.

**Heads up**: New templates don't automatically give Standard members any permissions. Administrators have to explicitly grant permissions (EDIT, READ, and/or LAUNCH) before Standard members can touch them.
:::

- **Working with Others:**
  - [Invite](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-to-invite-and-activate-members-on-tallyfy/) other Standard members (if the Admin allows this)
  - View the member and [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) list for your organization
  - Access shared tags and text [snippets](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/)
  - Check out [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) assignments and email history of colleagues

- **Other Access:**
  - View your organization's [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) key (handy for integrations)
  - Create and manage groups (if Administrator enables this feature)

#### What Standard members cannot do

There are clear boundaries. Standard members can't:
- Control access permissions for templates or running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)
- Permanently delete templates or processes (they can only archive/soft delete)
- Pin templates for organization-wide visibility
- Access member profiles or organization settings
- Configure SMTP, SAML, or custom branding
- Touch billing info or subscription plans - that's Admin territory

### When to use each member type

Choosing the right role matters. Here's who gets what:

**Administrator role fits**:
- Company executives who need complete system control
- IT administrators setting up integrations and managing security
- Operations managers who oversee all workflows across departments
- HR leaders responsible for user access and permissions

**Standard (Full member) role works for**:
- Department heads who create and manage team workflows
- Process improvement specialists designing new templates
- Team leads launching processes and tracking progress
- Quality assurance staff who update and refine procedures

**Light member role is perfect for**:
- Field service technicians working through checklists
- Warehouse staff processing daily shipments
- Customer service reps following call scripts
- External contractors handling specific tasks
- Part-time employees with focused responsibilities

:::note[Light member limitations]
Light members see templates only when an Administrator grants LAUNCH permission. Can't create, edit, or organize templates at all. But here's why that's actually great - this focused access makes Light members ideal for pure task execution roles, and they come at a substantial discount compared to Full members.
