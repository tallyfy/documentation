## Administrator vs Standard member roles

Tallyfy has two main paid [member roles](/products/pro/documenting/members/) - Administrator and Standard. There's also a Light role, covered below.

### Full vs Light members

**Full members** (Administrator and Standard) can create templates and run tasks. **Light members** can only complete assigned tasks - they can't create or edit templates.

:::tip[Save on member costs]
Light members cost less than Full members. Give Light licenses to people who only complete tasks (warehouse staff, field workers, contractors). Save Full licenses for process designers and managers who create workflows. See our [pricing page](https://tallyfy.com/pricing/) for current rates.
:::

### Administrator role

Administrators control everything in your Tallyfy account.

#### What Administrators can do

- **Account settings:**
  - Change [billing](/products/pro/settings/billing/) and subscription plans
  - Update [organization details](/products/pro/settings/org-settings/how-can-i-update-my-organization-details/)
  - Set up custom SMTP for organization emails
  - Manage organization logo and custom branding
  - Configure SAML/SSO settings[^1] (with Tallyfy support assistance)
  - View and manage all [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) and [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)

- **People management:**
  - [Invite new members](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-to-invite-and-activate-members-on-tallyfy/)
  - Set permissions for Standard members
  - Edit member profiles and remove members
  - View activity history

- **Process control:**
  - Create, edit, and view all [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)
  - Control access to specific templates and running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)
  - Permanently delete templates and processes (not just archive)
  - Pin templates for organization-wide visibility

#### How to find Administrators

1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Members**
2. Look for the **Administrator** role label

### Standard role

Standard members have limited permissions focused on daily work - not account management.

#### What Standard members can do (if allowed by an Admin)

Standard members can do a lot, but only with Administrator-granted permissions:

- **Templates:**
  - Create, edit, and view [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) they've been given access to
  - Launch processes from templates (requires LAUNCH permission)
  - Organize templates into folders
  - Import templates from other sources

:::note[Template visibility and permissions]
Templates appear in the library for Standard and Light members unless **ALL THREE** permissions (EDIT, READ, and LAUNCH) are removed. To hide a template completely, remove all three.

New templates don't automatically grant Standard members any permissions. Administrators must explicitly grant EDIT, READ, and/or LAUNCH access.
:::

- **Collaboration:**
  - [Invite](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-to-invite-and-activate-members-on-tallyfy/) other Standard or Light members (if allowed by Admin - can't assign the Admin role)
  - View the member and [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) list
  - Access shared tags and text [snippets](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/)
  - View [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) assignments and email history of colleagues

- **Other access:**
  - View your organization's [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) key
  - Create and manage groups (if the Administrator enables this)

#### What Standard members can't do

- Permanently delete templates or processes (archiving/soft delete[^2] only)
- Pin templates for organization-wide visibility
- Access member profiles or organization settings
- Configure SMTP, SAML, or custom branding
- Change billing or subscription plans

### When to use each role

**Administrator** - executives, IT admins managing integrations and security, operations managers overseeing all workflows, HR leaders managing user access.

**Standard (Full member)** - department heads creating team workflows, process improvement specialists, team leads launching and tracking processes, QA staff refining procedures.

**Light member** - field technicians working through checklists, warehouse staff, customer service reps following scripts, external contractors, part-time employees.

:::note[Light member limitations]
Light members see templates only when an Administrator grants LAUNCH permission. They can't create, edit, or organize templates. This focused access makes them ideal for task execution roles at a lower cost.
