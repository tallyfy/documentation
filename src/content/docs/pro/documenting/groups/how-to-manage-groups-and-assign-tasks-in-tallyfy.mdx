## Managing groups and assigning tasks

### What you need
- Permission level of Administrator or Standard [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/).
- Access to the **Settings** section.

### How do I create new groups in Tallyfy?

<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings** > **Organizations** > **Groups**.
2. Click the **+** button to add a new group.
   ![Group creation interface](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-create-new-group.png)
3. Type in a name and description for the group.
4. Add people ([members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) and [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/)) to the group.
5. Click **Create** to finish.
</Steps>

:::tip[Using Groups for Recurring Guests]
Create groups with frequently used guest emails (like a specific client team) to assign tasks quickly. This saves you from typing the same guest emails over and over.

### Assigning groups to tasks in templates

When you are creating or editing a process [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/):

<Steps>
1. Select the step ([task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/)) you want to assign.
2. Click in the assignment box (where it says "Assignee").
3. Choose the group you want to assign from the list.

</Steps>

### Setting options for group assignments

Control how group assignments work with these options:

- Enable **Enforce maximum number of assignees** to limit how many group members can work on one task.
- Set your maximum number when you enable this option.
- For dynamic assignments that change based on process conditions, use [assignment actions](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/actions/asignment-actions/) instead.

:::note[How group assignments work]
When a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) gets assigned to a group, whoever launches the process can pick specific people from that group or assign it to everyone (depending on your setup).

Template setup limits you to assigning either the whole group or specific individuals - no partial group assignments. But once a process runs, any group member can take ownership by editing the task assignment and removing others.
