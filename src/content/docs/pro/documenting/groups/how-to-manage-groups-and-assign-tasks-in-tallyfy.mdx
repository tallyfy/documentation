## Managing groups and assigning tasks

### What you'll need
- Administrator or Standard [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) permissions
- Access to the **Settings** section

### How do I create new groups in Tallyfy?

<Steps>
1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Organizations** > **Groups**.
2. Click the **+** button to create a new group.

3. Give your group a name and description.
4. Add the people you want - both [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) and [guests[^1]](/products/pro/documenting/guests/).
5. Click **Create**. Done.
</Steps>

:::tip[Using Groups for Recurring Guests]
Here's a time-saver: Create groups with guest emails you use often (like your client's team). You won't have to type those same email addresses again and again.

### Assigning groups to tasks in templates

When you're working with a process [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), it's simple:

<Steps>
1. Select the step ([task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/)) you want to assign.
2. Click the assignment box - you'll see "Assignee" there.
3. Pick your group from the dropdown list.

</Steps>

### Setting options for group assignments

You've got a few ways to control how group assignments work:

- **Enforce maximum number of assignees[^2]** - this limits how many people from the group can work on one task
- Once enabled, you'll set your maximum number
- Need assignments that change based on what's happening in your process? That's where [assignment actions](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/actions/asignment-actions/) come in

:::note[How group assignments work]
When you assign a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to a group, the person launching the process decides who actually gets it - they can pick specific people from that group or assign everyone (depends on how you've set things up).

Here's the thing: In templates, you can only assign the whole group or specific people - there's no middle ground. Once the process is running though? Any group member can jump in, edit the assignment, and take ownership.
