import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Groups let you bundle people together so you can assign them to tasks as a unit instead of one by one.

### What you'll need
- Admin or Standard [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) permissions
- Access to **Settings**

### Creating a group

<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Groups**.
2. Click **+** to create a new group.
   ![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-create-new-group.png)
3. Enter a name and description (both required).
4. Add [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) and/or [guests[^1]](/products/pro/documenting/guests/).
5. Click **Create**.
</Steps>

:::tip[Using groups for recurring guests]
Create groups with guest emails you use often (like your client's team). You won't have to re-type those addresses every time.

### Assigning groups to template steps

<Steps>
1. Open a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) and select the step ([task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/)) you want to assign.
2. Click the assignment box labeled "Assignee".
3. Pick your group from the dropdown.

</Steps>

### Group assignment options

- **Maximum assignees[^2]** - limits how many people from the group can work on one task. Set this at the organization level.
- For dynamic assignments that change based on process conditions, use [assignment actions](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/actions/asignment-actions/).

:::note[How group assignments work]
When you assign a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to a group, the person launching the process picks who actually gets it - specific people from the group or everyone.

In templates, you can only assign the whole group or specific individuals. Once a process is running, any group member can edit the assignment and take ownership.
