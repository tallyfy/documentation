:::note[Note on assigning groups]

When you assign a task to a group, you'll need to pick either a member or a group of people to complete the task. You can specify a maximum number of people who can be assigned to the task by toggling the "Enforce maximum number of assignees" option in the task settings. If you're looking into a more sofisticated way of dynamically assign tasks to groups, you might want to check out [assignment actions](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/actions/asignment-actions/).

That's it! Managing groups and assigning tasks with Tallyfy has never been easier. Stay organized and streamline your workflow effortlessly.
