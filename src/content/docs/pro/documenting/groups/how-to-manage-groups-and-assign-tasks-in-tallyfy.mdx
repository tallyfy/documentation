## How to create groups and assign tasks to them

- Permission level of Administrator or Standard [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/).
- Access to the **Settings** section.

1. Go to **Settings** > **Organizations** > **Groups**.
2. Click the **+** button to add a new group.

3. Type in a name and description for the group.
4. Add people ([members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) and [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/)) to the group.
5. Click **Create** to finish.
</Steps>

### Assigning groups to tasks in templates

When you are creating or editing a process [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/):

<Steps>
1. Select the step ([task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/)) you want to assign.
2. Click in the assignment box (where it says "Assignee").
3. Choose the group you want to assign from the list.

</Steps>

### Setting options for group assignments

You have options to control how tasks are assigned to groups:

- Turn on **Enforce maximum number of assignees** if you want to limit how many people from the group can be assigned to the task at one time.
- If you turn that on, set the maximum number allowed.
- If you need assignments to change automatically based on how the process is going, use [assignment actions](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/actions/asignment-actions/) instead.

:::note[How group assignments work]
When a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) is assigned to a group, the person launching the process can choose specific people from the group *or* assign it to the whole group (depending on how you set it up).

Currently, you cannot assign *just some* members of a group to a task directly within the template setup â€“ you either assign the whole group or specific individuals. However, once a process is running, an individual member can choose to take over a group task by editing the task assignees (removing the group) and assigning it only to themselves.
