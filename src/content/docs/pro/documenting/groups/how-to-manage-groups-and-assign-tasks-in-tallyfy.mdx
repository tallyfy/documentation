### Configuring group assignments

You can control how group assignments work with these options:

- Toggle **Enforce maximum number of assignees** to limit how many people from the group can be assigned
- Set the maximum number of assignees allowed
- For dynamic assignment based on process conditions, use [assignment actions](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/actions/asignment-actions/)

:::note[Group assignment behavior]
When you assign a task to a group, assigners will select either individual members or the entire group to complete the task, depending on your configuration.

Currently, you can only assign an entire group to a task or leave it unassigned. It is not possible to select a subset of members from within the group for assignment. However, individual members can "take over" a task by unassigning everyone (including groups) and assigning it to themselves using the task editing options.
