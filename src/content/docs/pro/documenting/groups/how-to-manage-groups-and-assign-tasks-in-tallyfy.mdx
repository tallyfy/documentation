### Configuring group assignments

You can control how group assignments work with these options:

- Toggle **Enforce maximum number of assignees** to limit how many people from the group can be assigned
- Set the maximum number of assignees allowed
- For dynamic assignment based on process conditions, use [assignment actions](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/actions/asignment-actions/)

:::note[Group assignment behavior]
When you assign a task to a group, assigners will select either individual members or the entire group to complete the task, depending on your configuration.
