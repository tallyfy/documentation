### How do groups work in Tallyfy for team organization?

Groups are organized lists of people (members or guests) assembled together for efficient task assignment. Groups make it easier to assign tasks to several people at once, streamlining workflow management and reducing administrative overhead.

Groups serve as reusable collections of individuals that can be consistently assigned to similar types of work or projects.

#### What benefits do groups provide for workflow management?

- **Assign tasks faster**: Give a task to a whole group instead of adding people one by one, reducing setup time.
- **Save time managing processes**: Makes assigning tasks in your processes quicker and more consistent across workflows.
- **Keep lists updated automatically**: When members join or leave your company, Tallyfy updates the groups they are in without manual intervention.
- **Easier membership changes**: Handles updates smoothly when people's roles change, maintaining accurate group compositions.

These benefits scale particularly well for organizations with recurring team-based workflows and frequent personnel changes.

#### What does a practical group example look like?

You could have a group called "Accounting Team" with:
- Jane Doe (member)
- Jill Ramirez (member) 
- tim.smith@gmail.com (guest)

This mixed composition allows internal team members to work alongside external consultants or clients as needed for specific workflows.

#### How is group membership managed automatically?

- People who leave your company are automatically removed from all groups they were in, maintaining accurate group compositions.
- You can add new employees to the right groups when they start, ensuring immediate workflow participation.
- You can put both regular members and outside guests in the same group, enabling mixed internal-external collaboration.

This automatic management reduces administrative burden while ensuring groups remain current and functional.
