  based on organizational changes.

## Groups

Groups are collections of members or guests that allow for efficient task assignment.

### Benefits of using groups

- **Assign tasks to multiple people** at once rather than individually
- **Save time** on process management and task assignment 
- **Automatic updates** when members join or leave your organization
- **Simplified conflict resolution** for membership changes

### Example

A group called "Accounting Team" might include:
- Jane Doe (member)
- Jill Ramirez (member)
- tim.smith@gmail.com (guest)

### Managing group membership

- Members who leave your company are automatically removed from all groups
- New members can be added to relevant groups during onboarding
- Both members and guests can be included in the same group
