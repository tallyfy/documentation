### What are groups?

Groups let you assign tasks to entire teams at once - saved lists of people you work with regularly. Pick the group instead of adding people one by one.

#### Benefits

- **Faster task assignment** - one click assigns the whole team
- **Consistent workflows** - same groups work across all your processes[^2]
- **Automatic updates** - someone leaves? They're removed from all groups automatically
- **Smooth transitions** - new members get added once and they're ready to go

If you're running the same workflows every week or month, groups save you from repetitive setup work.

#### Group composition example

An "Accounting Team" group might contain:
- Jane Doe (member)
- Jill Ramirez (member)
- tim.smith@gmail.com (guest[^1])

You can mix internal team members with external partners in the same group. Your auditor, consultant, or client can work right alongside your staff.

#### Automatic membership management

When someone leaves your company, Tallyfy removes them from every group automatically. No hunting through workflows to clean up assignments.

- New hires join their groups on day one - instant access to all their workflows
- External guests work smoothly with your team (still free and unlimited)
- Membership stays current without manual effort
