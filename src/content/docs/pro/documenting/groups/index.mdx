### Understanding groups in Tallyfy

Groups are organized collections of people you can assign tasks to all at once. Instead of adding individuals one by one, you assign the entire group and save significant time on workflow setup.

Groups work as reusable collections of individuals that can be consistently assigned to similar types of work or projects.

#### Key benefits of using groups

- **Faster task assignment**: Assign to entire groups instead of adding individuals separately
- **Consistent workflows**: Use the same groups across multiple processes for standardization
- **Automatic updates**: When people join or leave your company, group memberships update automatically
- **Smooth transitions**: Role changes get handled without breaking existing workflows

This becomes especially valuable for companies with recurring team workflows and regular staff changes.

#### Group composition example

You could have a group called "Accounting Team" with:
- Jane Doe (member)
- Jill Ramirez (member) 
- tim.smith@gmail.com (guest)

This mixed composition allows internal team members to work alongside external consultants or clients as needed for specific workflows.

#### Automatic membership management

- Departing employees get removed from all groups automatically - no manual cleanup required
- New employees can join relevant groups immediately for instant workflow access
- Mix internal members with external guests in the same group for flexible collaboration

This automatic management reduces administrative burden while making sure groups remain current and functional.
