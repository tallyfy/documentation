### What are groups?

Groups are simply lists of people ([members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) or [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/)) put together. They make it easier to assign [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to several people at once.

#### Benefits of using groups

- **Assign tasks faster**: Give a task to a whole group instead of adding people one by one.
- **Save time managing processes**: Makes assigning tasks in your [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) quicker.
- **Keep lists updated automatically**: When members join or leave your company, Tallyfy updates the groups they are in.
- **Easier membership changes**: Handles updates smoothly when people's roles change.

#### Example

You could have a group called "Accounting Team" with:
- Jane Doe (member)
- Jill Ramirez (member)
- tim.smith@gmail.com (guest)

#### Managing who is in a group

- People who leave your company are automatically removed from all groups they were in.
- You can add new employees to the right groups when they start.
- You can put both regular members and outside [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) in the same group.
