## Groups

Groups are collections of members or guests.

Let's imagine there's three people:

- Jane Doe (a member)
- Jill Ramirez (a member)
- tim.smith@gmail.com (a guest)

You can put the three above in a single group and name it something like "Employees and contractors in St. Louis, MO".

Groups are excellent ways to scale your processes and lot a ton of time because you can assign a step or task to a group instead of manually assigning and unassigning people.

If a member leaves your company - they also leave all groups they belong to, using our conflict resolution process for deleting members. If someone joins your company, you can add them to any groups you choose.

You can learn how to manage and create groups in Tallyfy here:
