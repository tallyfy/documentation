### Understanding groups in Tallyfy

Groups let you assign tasks to entire teams at once - think of them as saved lists of people you work with regularly. Simple.

Instead of clicking "assign" and adding people one by one (we've all wasted time on that), you just pick the group. Your workflow setup that used to take 10 minutes? Now it's done in seconds.

#### Key benefits of using groups

- **Faster task assignment**: One click assigns the whole team
- **Consistent workflows**: Same groups work across all your processes[^2]  
- **Automatic updates**: Someone leaves? They're out of all groups automatically
- **Smooth transitions**: New team members get added once and they're ready to go

Here's where it gets really useful - if you're running the same workflows every week or month, groups save you from repetitive setup work.

#### Group composition example

Let's say you create an "Accounting Team" group:
- Jane Doe (member)
- Jill Ramirez (member) 
- tim.smith@gmail.com (guest[^1])

Notice that last one? You can mix your internal team with external partners in the same group. Your auditor, consultant, or client can work right alongside your staff.

#### Automatic membership management

This is my favorite part. When someone leaves your company, Tallyfy removes them from every group automatically. No hunting through workflows to clean up assignments.

- New hires join their groups on day one - instant access to all their workflows
- External guests work seamlessly with your team (yes, still free and unlimited)
- Everything stays current without you lifting a finger

The result? Less time managing people lists, more time getting work done.
