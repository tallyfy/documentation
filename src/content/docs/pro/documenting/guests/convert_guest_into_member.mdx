title: Convert a guest into a member
---

## Converting a guest into a member

### Prerequisites
- Administrator access
- An active guest user in your organization
- Available member seat in your plan

### Why convert a guest to a member
Converting a guest to a member provides them with:
- Full access to the Tallyfy platform based on their assigned role
- Ability to create and manage processes
- Login credentials to access the system
- Visibility across multiple processes instead of individual tasks

### Steps to convert a guest to a member

1. Navigate to **Settings > Organization > Guests**
2. Locate the guest user you want to convert
3. Click **Convert to member** in the guest's row
4. The system will:
   - Add the guest to your members list
   - Send them an email to set up their password
   - Apply the default Standard member role

### After conversion
- The new member will need to create a password upon their first login
- You can adjust their role as needed through **Settings > Organization > Members**
- The user will now count against your member seat limit rather than your guest user count
