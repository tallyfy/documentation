## How to change a guest into a member

### What you need
- Administrator permission level.
- The person must already be a [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) user in your Tallyfy account.
- You need an open spot (an available [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) seat) in your subscription plan.

### Why change a Guest to a Member?
Changing a guest into a [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) gives them more access:
- They get full access to Tallyfy based on the [role](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-do-i-manage-member-permissions-in-tallyfy/) you give them (like Standard or Light).
- They can create and manage [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).
- They get their own login and password.
- They can see more than just the individual [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) assigned to them.

### Steps to change a Guest into a Member

<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Guests**.
2. Find the guest user you want to change in the list.
3. Click **Convert to member** in that guest's row.
4. Tallyfy will automatically:
   - Move the person from the guest list to your members list.
   - Send them an email asking them to set up a password.
   - Give them the default role of Standard member.
</Steps>

### What happens next
- The person will need to create a password the first time they log in as a member.
- You can change their role (e.g., to Light or Administrator) if needed by going to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Members**.
- This person will now use one of your paid member seats instead of counting as a free guest.
