## Converting a guest to a member

To convert a guest to a member in Tallyfy, click **Convert to member** next to their name in the guest list. It's that simple.

### Before you start
You'll need three things:
- Administrator permissions (only admins can do this)
- The person should already be a [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) in your Tallyfy account
- An available [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) seat in your subscription

### Why convert someone?
Guests can only see tasks assigned to them - that's it. When you convert them to a [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/), they get:
- Full Tallyfy access based on their [role](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-do-i-manage-member-permissions-in-tallyfy/) (Standard, Light, or Administrator)
- Ability to create and manage [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) themselves
- Their own secure login and password
- Visibility into entire workflows - not just their [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/)

### The conversion process

<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Guests**.
2. Find the guest user you want to change in the list.
3. Click **Convert to member** in that guest's row.
4. Tallyfy handles everything automatically:
   - Moves them from the guest list to your members list
   - Sends them a password setup email
   - Assigns them as a Standard member (you can change this later)
</Steps>

### What happens after conversion

The new member gets an email right away. They'll need to set a password when they first log in.

Want to adjust their permissions? Head to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Members** and change their role to Light or Administrator.

One thing to note: they'll now occupy a paid member seat in your subscription. Guests are free, members aren't.
