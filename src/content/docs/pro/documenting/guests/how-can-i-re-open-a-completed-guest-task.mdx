## Re-opening completed guest tasks

### Why guests can't re-open their own tasks

[Guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) can only complete a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) once - they can't re-open it themselves. This keeps decisions final and prevents confusion in later steps.

If a guest needs to add information after submitting, they can:
- Add comments to the completed task
- Ask a [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) to re-open the task for them

### What you need to re-open a guest task
- You must be a member with Administrator or Standard permission
- The guest task must already be completed

### Steps to re-open a guest task

Only members can do this - not guests themselves:
<Steps>
1. Go to the running [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) that contains the completed guest task.
2. Click the completed task you want to re-open.
3. Click the **Re-Open** button.
4. Tallyfy handles the rest automatically:
   - Changes the task status back to active
   - Sends an email notifying the guest
   - Makes the task available for the guest to work on again
</Steps>

### Sending the task link again

After re-opening a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), you might need to resend the link:

<Steps>
1. Click the menu icon (three dots) on the task card.
2. Choose **Copy [guest link](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-to-find-a-guest-task-link-in-tallyfy/)**.
3. Send this link to the guest if they need it.
</Steps>

### Where guests see re-opened tasks

[Guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) find all their assigned [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) - including re-opened ones - on their **[Guest Dashboard](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-can-guests-monitor-their-processes-on-tallyfy/)**. They can also leave comments there.
