## How members can re-open completed guest tasks

### Understanding Guest task limitations

[Guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) can only complete a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) once and cannot re-open tasks themselves. This creates finality in your workflows and ensures downstream steps aren't disrupted by changes to previous decisions.

If guests need to provide additional information after completion, they can:
- Add comments to the completed task
- Request a [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) to re-open the task

### Requirements
- Administrator or Standard member permissions
- A completed guest task that needs to be reopened

### Steps to re-open a Guest task

<Steps>
1. Navigate to the active [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) containing the completed guest task
2. Click on the completed task to open it
3. Click the **Re-Open** button
4. The system will automatically:
   - Change the task status back to active
   - Send a notification email to the guest
   - Make the task accessible to the guest again
</Steps>

### Sharing the re-opened Task link

After re-opening a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/):

<Steps>
1. Click the ellipsis (three dots) icon on the task
2. Select **Copy [guest link](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-to-find-a-guest-task-link-in-tallyfy/)**
3. Share this link with the guest if needed
</Steps>

### Guest Task tracking

[Guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) can access all their [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) (including re-opened ones) through the **[Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** interface, where they can also leave comments on tasks.
