## How members can re-open completed guest tasks

### Why guests can't re-open their own tasks

[Guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) can only complete a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) once. They cannot re-open tasks after completing them. This is done so that decisions are final and don't mess up later steps in the process.

If a guest needs to add more information after they've completed a task, they can:
- Add comments to the completed task.
- Ask a [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) of your team to re-open the task for them.

### What you need to re-open a guest task
- You must be a member with Administrator or Standard permission.
- There must be a guest task that has already been completed.

### Steps to re-open a Guest task

Only members (not guests) can do this:
<Steps>
1. Go to the running [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) that has the completed guest task.
2. Click on the completed task you want to re-open.
3. Click the **Re-Open** button.
4. Tallyfy will automatically:
   - Change the task's status back so it's active again.
   - Send an email to the guest letting them know the task is re-opened.
   - Make the task available for the guest to work on again.
</Steps>

### Sending the Task link again

After you re-open a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/):

<Steps>
1. Click the menu icon (three dots) on the task card.
2. Choose **Copy [guest link](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-to-find-a-guest-task-link-in-tallyfy/)**.
3. You can then send this link to the guest if they need it.
</Steps>

### Where guests see re-opened tasks

[Guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) can see all their assigned [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) (including any that were re-opened) on their **[Guest Dashboard](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-can-guests-monitor-their-processes-on-tallyfy/)**. They can also leave comments there.
