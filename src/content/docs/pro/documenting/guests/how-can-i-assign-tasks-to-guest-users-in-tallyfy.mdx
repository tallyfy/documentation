## How to assign tasks to guest users

### What you need
- Permission level of Administrator or Standard [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/).
- The [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) user's email address.
- A process [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) or a running [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) that has the [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) you want to assign.

### Method 1: Assign when building the template

<Steps>
1. Open the process [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) you want to edit.
2. Go to the step ([task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/)) you want to assign to a guest.
3. Click the **Assign** tab for that step.
4. Choose **Guest** as the type of person to assign.
5. Type the guest's email address into the assignee box.
</Steps>

When someone [launches](/products/pro/launching/) this template later, Tallyfy will automatically assign this [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to the guest you entered.

:::note[Assigning many tasks quickly]
If you need to assign many [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to guests in a template, try using the [Power Assign](/products/pro/documenting/templates/how-can-power-tools-enhance-my-tallyfy-experience/) tool to speed things up.

### Method 2: Assign after starting the process

If a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) is already running, you can assign a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to a [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/):

<Steps>
1. Go to the running process that contains the task.
2. Find the task you want to assign.
3. Click the assignee box (it might say "Unassigned" or show someone else).
4. Choose **Guest** from the options.
5. Type in the guest's email address.
6. Click **Save**.
</Steps>

The guest will get an email with a special link to view and complete their task.

### Method 3: Assign using a comment

You can also assign a [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) just by mentioning their email in a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) comment:

<Steps>
1. Open the task you want to assign.
2. In the comment box, type `+` followed immediately by the guest's email address (e.g., `+guest.email@example.com`).
3. Post the comment.
</Steps>

Example comment:
```
+guest.email@example.com Please review this.
```

Typing `+guestemail@domain.com` in a comment automatically assigns that [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) to the [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/). This works when editing [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) or in tasks of running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). It's a fast way to bring outside people into your workflow.

### What happens after you assign a task to a guest?

When a [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) gets assigned a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/):
- They get an email with a special [link](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-to-find-a-guest-task-link-in-tallyfy/) to their task.
- They can open the link and complete the task without needing to log into Tallyfy.
- The task will also show up on their personal [guest dashboard](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-can-guests-monitor-their-processes-on-tallyfy/) if they have other tasks assigned to them.
- After they complete it, the task will show as "Completed" in your [process view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/).

### Managing tasks assigned to guests

- You can see all tasks assigned to guests under **Settings** > **Organization** > **[Guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/)**.
- You can find the [guest links](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-to-find-a-guest-task-link-in-tallyfy/) again anytime if you need to resend them.
- You can check if guests have completed their tasks from your [process dashboard](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/).
- You can change who a task is assigned to later if needed.
