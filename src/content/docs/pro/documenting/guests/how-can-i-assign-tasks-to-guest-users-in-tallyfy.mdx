- A template or active process with tasks to assign

### Method 1: Assign during template creation

3. Click the **Assign** tab
4. Select **Guest** as the assignment type
5. Enter the guest's email address in the assignee field

When you launch the template, the system will automatically assign the task to the specified guest.

For quickly assigning multiple tasks to guests, use the [Power Assign](/products/pro/documenting/templates/how-can-power-tools-enhance-my-tallyfy-experience/) feature to streamline the process.

### Method 2: Assign after process launch

To assign a guest to a task in an active process:

1. Navigate to the process containing the task
2. Locate the task you want to assign
3. Click the assignee dropdown
4. Select **Guest**
5. Enter the guest's email address
6. Click **Save**

The guest will receive an email notification with a link to access their task.

### Method 3: Assign through comments

You can also assign a guest by mentioning them in a task comment:

1. Open the task you want to assign
2. Type a comment that includes `+guestemail@domain.com` (replacing with the actual email)
3. Post the comment

Example comment format:
```
+guestemail@domain.com
```

### What happens after assignment

When a guest is assigned a task:
- They receive an email notification with a task link
- They can access and complete the task without logging in
- The task appears in their guest dashboard if they have multiple tasks
- Once completed, the task status updates to "Completed" in your process view

### Managing guest assignments

- View all guest assignments under **Settings > Organization > Guests**
- Access guest links at any time to resend if needed
- Monitor guest task completion status from your process dashboard
- Reassign tasks if necessary by changing the assignee
