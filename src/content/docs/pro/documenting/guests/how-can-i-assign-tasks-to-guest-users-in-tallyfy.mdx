## How to assign tasks to guest users

Enter a [guest's](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) email address when assigning any [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), and they'll get a secure link[^1] to complete their work - no account needed.

### What you need
- Administrator or Standard [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) permissions (Light members can't assign guests)
- The guest's email address
- A [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) or running [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) with the task you want to assign

:::note[Guest email restrictions]
You can't assign guest tasks to email addresses that already belong to a member in your organization. If your org uses SSO, guest emails also can't match your configured company domains.
:::

### Method 1: Assign when building the template

Set up guest assignments in your template so every process launch assigns the right external people automatically.

<Steps>
1. Open the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) you want to edit.
2. Go to the step you want to assign to a guest.
3. Click the **Assign** tab for that step.
4. Choose **Guest** as the assignment type.
5. Type the guest's email address into the assignee box.
6. **Press Enter/Return to confirm the email** - required for the email to register properly.
</Steps>

When someone [launches](/products/pro/launching/) this template, Tallyfy automatically assigns the task to your specified guest.

:::note[Assigning many tasks quickly]
Use the [Power Assign](/products/pro/documenting/templates/how-can-power-tools-enhance-my-tallyfy-experience/) tool to assign many tasks to guests at once in a template.
:::

### Method 2: Assign in a running process

You can assign tasks to guests even after a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) is already running.

<Steps>
1. Go to the running process that contains the task.
2. Find the task you want to assign.
3. Click the assignee box.
4. Choose **Guest** from the options.
5. Type the guest's email address.
6. **Press Enter/Return to confirm the email** before saving.
7. Click **Save**.
</Steps>

The guest receives an email with a secure link to view and complete their task - no account or password needed.

### Method 3: Assign using a comment

You can assign a [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) by typing `+` followed by their email in a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) comment.

<Steps>
1. Open the task you want to assign.
2. In the comment box, type `+` followed immediately by the guest's email address (e.g., `+guest.email@example.com`).
3. Post the comment.
</Steps>

Example comment:
```
+guest.email@example.com Please review this.
```

Tallyfy assigns the guest to the task as soon as the comment posts. This works in both [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) and running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) - handy when you're already discussing the task in comments.

### What happens after assignment

Once you assign a task to a [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/):

- They get an email with a secure [link](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-to-find-a-guest-task-link-in-tallyfy/) to their task
- They click the link and complete the task - no login required
- Multiple tasks appear on their personal [guest dashboard](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-can-guests-monitor-their-processes-on-tallyfy/)
- You'll see "Completed" status in your [process view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/) once they finish

:::tip[Troubleshooting guest email delivery]
**Guest not receiving emails?** Check these common issues:
1. **Email not confirmed** - Did you press Enter/Return after typing the email? Required to register it properly
2. **Task not active yet** - Guests only get notified when their task becomes active (not while it's waiting)
3. **Email in spam folder** - Ask the guest to check spam/junk and whitelist tallyfy.com
4. **Member co-assignment** - At least one member must also be assigned
5. **Wrong email address** - Verify spelling and that it's not already a member in your org
6. **Process not launched** - Template assignments only take effect after the process launches
7. **Owner re-assignment** - If removing the process owner causes them to be re-added, keep the owner assigned and add the guest as a co-assignee
8. **UI issues** - Try refreshing the page, check your permissions, or use a different browser

Find the guest link manually: **Settings** > **Organization** > **Guests** to resend.
:::

### Managing guest task assignments

- View all guests: **Settings** > **Organization** > **[Guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/)**
- Resend a lost guest link from the [guest links](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-to-find-a-guest-task-link-in-tallyfy/) page
- Track progress in your [process dashboard](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)
- Reassign tasks to different people at any time

### Member co-assignment with guest tasks

When you assign a task to a guest, a member is automatically co-assigned to that task.

:::caution[Guest-only assignment not allowed]
At least one internal member must be co-assigned to any guest task. If you remove all members, Tallyfy automatically keeps or adds a member.
:::

**Why this exists**:
1. **Comment routing** - Guest comments need a member to receive notifications
2. **Oversight** - Members can approve guest work and track progress
3. **Guest limitations[^2]** - Guests can't @-reply internal members (the member list is private to guests)

**Impact on your task list**:
- Guest tasks appear in your personal task list until completed
- If you assign 10 guest tasks, you'll have 10 pending tasks yourself
- These stay "active" for you even while the guest works on them

**Tip**: Designate specific team members as guest task coordinators to centralize oversight rather than spreading it across many people. Use filters to separate your own work from guest oversight tasks.
