## How to assign tasks to guest users

### Requirements
- Administrator or Standard [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) permissions
- [Guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) user's email address
- A [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) or active [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) with [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to assign

### Method 1: Assign during template creation

1. Open the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) editor
2. Navigate to the step you want to assign to a guest
3. Click the **Assign** tab
4. Select **Guest** as the assignment type
5. Enter the guest's email address in the assignee field

When you [launch](/products/pro/launching/) the template, the system will automatically assign the [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to the specified guest.

:::note[Power Assign for bulk guest assignments]
For quickly assigning multiple [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to guests, use the [Power Assign](/products/pro/documenting/templates/how-can-power-tools-enhance-my-tallyfy-experience/) feature to streamline the process.

### Method 2: Assign after process launch

To assign a [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) to a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in an active [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/):

1. Navigate to the process containing the task
2. Locate the task you want to assign
3. Click the assignee dropdown
4. Select **Guest**
5. Enter the guest's email address
6. Click **Save**

The guest will receive an email notification with a link to access their task.

### Method 3: Assign through comments

You can also assign a [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) by mentioning them in a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) comment:

1. Open the task you want to assign
2. Type a comment that includes `+guestemail@domain.com` (replacing with the actual email)
3. Post the comment

Example comment format:
```
+guestemail@domain.com
```

This command functionality will automatically assign the [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) to the [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/). It works in both [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) comments and active [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) tasks, providing a quick way to add external collaborators to your workflow.

### What happens after assignment

When a [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) is assigned a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/):
- They receive an email notification with a [task link](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-to-find-a-guest-task-link-in-tallyfy/)
- They can access and complete the task without logging in
- The task appears in their [guest dashboard](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-can-guests-monitor-their-processes-on-tallyfy/) if they have multiple tasks
- Once completed, the task status updates to "Completed" in your [process view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)

### Managing guest assignments

- View all guest assignments under **Settings > Organization > [Guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/)**
- Access [guest links](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-to-find-a-guest-task-link-in-tallyfy/) at any time to resend if needed
- Monitor guest task completion status from your [process dashboard](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)
- Reassign tasks if necessary by changing the assignee
