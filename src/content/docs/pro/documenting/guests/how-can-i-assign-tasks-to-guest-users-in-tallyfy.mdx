## How to assign tasks to guest users

Assigning tasks to guest users in Tallyfy is straightforward - just enter their email address when assigning any task, and they'll receive a secure link to complete their work without needing an account. Here's exactly how to do it.

### What you need
- Administrator or Standard [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) permissions (Light users can't do this)
- The [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) user's email address
- A process [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) or running [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) with the [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) you want to assign

:::note[Guest email domain restriction]
Guest email addresses cannot be from the same domain as your organization. For example, if your company uses `mydomain.com` email addresses, you cannot assign guest tasks to emails ending in `@mydomain.com`. This restriction ensures proper separation between internal members and external guests.

### Method 1: Assign when building the template

The most efficient approach? Set up guest assignments right in your template. That way, every time someone launches the process, the right external people get their tasks automatically.

<Steps>
1. Open the process [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) you want to edit.
2. Navigate to the step ([task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/)) you want to assign to a guest.
3. Click the **Assign** tab for that step.
4. Choose **Guest** as the assignment type.
5. Type the guest's email address into the assignee box.
</Steps>

When someone [launches](/products/pro/launching/) this template later, Tallyfy automatically assigns this [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to your specified guest. No extra steps needed.

:::note[Assigning many tasks quickly]
If you need to assign many [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to guests in a template, try using the [Power Assign](/products/pro/documenting/templates/how-can-power-tools-enhance-my-tallyfy-experience/) tool to speed things up.
:::

### Method 2: Assign after starting the process

Sometimes you realize mid-process that you need external help. No problem - you can assign tasks to guests even after a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) is already running.

<Steps>
1. Go to the running process that contains the task.
2. Find the task you want to assign.
3. Click the assignee box (it might say "Unassigned" or show someone else).
4. Choose **Guest** from the options.
5. Type in the guest's email address.
6. Click **Save**.
</Steps>

Done. The guest receives an email with a secure link to view and complete their task - they won't need to create an account or remember any passwords.

### Method 3: Assign using a comment

Here's a neat trick: you can assign a [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) simply by mentioning their email in a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) comment. Quick and easy.

<Steps>
1. Open the task you want to assign.
2. In the comment box, type `+` followed immediately by the guest's email address (e.g., `+guest.email@example.com`).
3. Post the comment.
</Steps>

Example comment:
```
+guest.email@example.com Please review this.
```

The moment you type `+guestemail@domain.com` in a comment, Tallyfy assigns that [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) to the [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/). This works when editing [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) or in tasks of running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). It's the fastest way to bring outside people into your workflow - especially handy when you're already discussing the task in comments.

### What happens after you assign a task to a guest?

Once you've assigned a task to a [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/), here's what they experience:

- They receive an email with a secure [link](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-to-find-a-guest-task-link-in-tallyfy/) directly to their task
- They click the link and complete the task - no login required, no passwords to remember
- If they have multiple tasks, they'll see them all on their personal [guest dashboard](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-can-guests-monitor-their-processes-on-tallyfy/)
- Once they mark it complete, you'll see "Completed" status in your [process view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)

Simple for them, transparent for you.

### Managing tasks assigned to guests

Need to keep track of guest assignments? Tallyfy makes it easy:

- View all guest tasks in one place: **Settings** > **Organization** > **[Guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/)**.
- Lost a guest link? Find and resend [guest links](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-to-find-a-guest-task-link-in-tallyfy/) anytime.
- Monitor progress through your [process dashboard](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/) - see exactly which guest tasks are pending or complete.
- Need to reassign? You can change task assignments whenever necessary.
