## How to assign tasks to guest users

Assigning tasks to guest users in Tallyfy is straightforward - just enter their email address when assigning any task, and they'll receive a secure link to complete their work without needing an account. Here's exactly how to do it.

### What you need
- Administrator or Standard [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) permissions (Light users can't do this)
- The [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) user's email address
- A process [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) or running [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) with the [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) you want to assign

:::note[Guest email domain restriction]
Guest email addresses cannot be from the same domain as your organization. For example, if your company uses `mydomain.com` email addresses, you cannot assign guest tasks to emails ending in `@mydomain.com`. This restriction ensures proper separation between internal members and external guests.

### Method 1: Assign when building the template

The most efficient approach? Set up guest assignments right in your template. That way, every time someone launches the process, the right external people get their tasks automatically.

<Steps>
1. Open the process [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) you want to edit.
2. Navigate to the step ([task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/)) you want to assign to a guest.
3. Click the **Assign** tab for that step.
4. Choose **Guest** as the assignment type.
5. Type the guest's email address into the assignee box.
6. **Press Enter/Return key to confirm the email** - this step is crucial for the email to be properly registered.
</Steps>

When someone [launches](/products/pro/launching/) this template later, Tallyfy automatically assigns this [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to your specified guest. No extra steps needed.

:::note[Assigning many tasks quickly]
If you need to assign many [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to guests in a template, try using the [Power Assign](/products/pro/documenting/templates/how-can-power-tools-enhance-my-tallyfy-experience/) tool to speed things up.
:::

### Method 2: Assign after starting the process

Sometimes you realize mid-process that you need external help. No problem - you can assign tasks to guests even after a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) is already running.

<Steps>
1. Go to the running process that contains the task.
2. Find the task you want to assign.
3. Click the assignee box (it might say "Unassigned" or show someone else).
4. Choose **Guest** from the options.
5. Type in the guest's email address.
6. **Press Enter/Return key to confirm the email** before saving.
7. Click **Save**.
</Steps>

Done. The guest receives an email with a secure link to view and complete their task - they won't need to create an account or remember any passwords.

### Method 3: Assign using a comment

Here's a neat trick: you can assign a [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) simply by mentioning their email in a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) comment. Quick and easy.

<Steps>
1. Open the task you want to assign.
2. In the comment box, type `+` followed immediately by the guest's email address (e.g., `+guest.email@example.com`).
3. Post the comment.
</Steps>

Example comment:
```
+guest.email@example.com Please review this.
```

The moment you type `+guestemail@domain.com` in a comment, Tallyfy assigns that [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) to the [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/). This works when editing [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) or in tasks of running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). It's the fastest way to bring outside people into your workflow - especially handy when you're already discussing the task in comments.

### What happens after you assign a task to a guest?

Once you've assigned a task to a [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/), here's what they experience:

- They receive an email with a secure [link](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-to-find-a-guest-task-link-in-tallyfy/) directly to their task
- They click the link and complete the task - no login required, no passwords to remember
- If they have multiple tasks, they'll see them all on their personal [guest dashboard](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-can-guests-monitor-their-processes-on-tallyfy/)
- Once they mark it complete, you'll see "Completed" status in your [process view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)

Simple for them, transparent for you.

:::tip[Troubleshooting guest email delivery]
**Guest not receiving emails?** Check these common issues:
1. **Email not confirmed** - Did you press Enter/Return after typing the email? This is required to register the email properly
2. **Task not active yet** - Guests only get notified when their task becomes active (not when it's waiting)
3. **Email in spam folder** - Ask guest to check spam/junk and whitelist tallyfy.com
4. **Member co-assignment** - Ensure at least one member is also assigned (guests can't be assigned alone)
5. **Wrong email address** - Verify spelling and that it's not from your organization's domain
6. **Process not launched** - If assigning in template, the process must be launched first
7. **Owner re-assignment bug** - If removing the process owner causes the owner to be re-added automatically, keep the owner assigned but add the guest as a co-assignee. The guest will still receive their task notification.
8. **UI state issues** - If the guest assignment button appears grayed out or unclickable, try: refreshing the page, checking you have proper permissions, ensuring the task is in an editable state, or using a different browser

Find the guest link manually: **Settings** > **Organization** > **Guests** to resend.

### Managing tasks assigned to guests

Need to keep track of guest assignments? Tallyfy makes it easy:

- View all guest tasks in one place: **Settings** > **Organization** > **[Guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/)**.
- Lost a guest link? Find and resend [guest links](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-to-find-a-guest-task-link-in-tallyfy/) anytime.
- Monitor progress through your [process dashboard](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/) - see exactly which guest tasks are pending or complete.
- Need to reassign? You can change task assignments whenever necessary.

### Understanding member co-assignment with guest tasks

**Important behavior**: When you assign a task to a guest, you (or another member) are automatically co-assigned to that task.

:::caution[Guest-only assignment not allowed]
**You cannot assign a task to ONLY guests.** At least one internal member must always be co-assigned to any guest-facing task. This is a system requirement that cannot be bypassed.

If you try to assign a task to only guests (removing all members), the system will automatically keep or add a member to maintain the co-assignment requirement.
:::

**Why this requirement exists**:
1. **Comment routing** - Guest questions and comments need a member to receive notifications
2. **Approval authority** - Members maintain oversight and can approve guest work
3. **System notifications** - Ensures someone internal tracks guest task progress
4. **Accountability** - Creates clear ownership for external collaboration
5. **Guest limitations** - Guests cannot @-reply internal members (member list is private to guests)

**Impact on your task list**:
- Guest tasks appear in your personal task list until completed
- If you delegate 10 guest tasks, you'll have 10 pending tasks yourself
- These tasks remain "active" for you even if the guest is working on them

**Managing the task burden**:
- **Current workaround**: Use filters to separate your actual work from guest oversight tasks
- **Future solution**: A "watching" feature is in development that will:
  - Allow monitoring guest tasks without being assigned
  - Send notifications without cluttering your task list
  - Maintain oversight with less administrative burden
  - Separate "doing" tasks from "monitoring" tasks

**Best practice**: Designate specific team members as guest task coordinators to centralize this oversight role rather than distributing it across many employees.
