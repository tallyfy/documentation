## What guests see (the guest dashboard)

The [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) dashboard is a special page where people outside your company (guests) can see all the [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) assigned to them from different Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), all in one place.

### How guests get to their dashboard

[Guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) can see their dashboard in two ways:
1. Click the **special [task link](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-to-find-a-guest-task-link-in-tallyfy/)** they receive in their email.
2. Go to [https://go.tallyfy.com](https://go.tallyfy.com/) and type in their email address.

### What's on the dashboard

The guest dashboard shows:

- **Process list**: A list of all processes where the guest has assigned tasks.
- **Task cards**: Each individual task assigned to the guest.
- **Status markers**: Easy-to-see signs showing if a task is waiting, being worked on, or finished.
- **Comments section**: A place to leave comments or ask questions about a task.
- **Attachments**: Any files shared with the guest for a task.
- **Due dates**: Shows when tasks need to be completed.

### Using the dashboard
