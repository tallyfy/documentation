## What guests see (the guest dashboard)

Your [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) dashboard shows all [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) assigned to you across different Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) - think of it as your personal command center. You'll find everything you need to complete your work without juggling multiple emails or systems.

Simple.

### How guests get to their dashboard

You can access your dashboard two ways:
1. Click the **special [task link](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-to-find-a-guest-task-link-in-tallyfy/)** in your email notification - it takes you straight there
2. Visit [https://go.tallyfy.com](https://go.tallyfy.com/) and enter your email address

That's it. No passwords, no complicated logins.

### What's on the dashboard

Here's what you'll see when you log in:

- **Process list**: Every process where you have work to do
- **Task cards**: Your specific assignments displayed clearly
- **Status markers**: Visual indicators showing whether tasks are pending, in progress, or complete
- **Comments section**: Where you can ask questions or provide updates (yes, it's that straightforward)
- **Attachments**: All files you need for each task
- **Due dates**: Clear deadlines so you know what's urgent

### Using the dashboard

#### Seeing process details
Want to dive deeper into a specific process? Here's how:

1. Find the [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) you need on your dashboard
2. Click its name - this opens the detailed view
3. You'll see all [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) assigned specifically to you within that process

No hunting around. Just your work, clearly laid out.

#### Working on tasks
Ready to tackle a task? The process couldn't be simpler:

1. Click the [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) you want to complete
2. Review the instructions - they tell you exactly what's needed
3. Fill in any [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) or upload required files
4. Questions? Drop them in the comments
5. Hit **Complete** when you're finished

Done.

#### Tracking progress
You'll always know where things stand:

- Completed tasks show a checkmark
- Your current task is highlighted - can't miss it
- Future tasks display when they'll unlock
- A progress bar reveals how far along the entire process has come

It's like having a GPS for your work.

### What guests can do

As a [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) user, you can:
- Complete any [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) assigned to you
- Access all documents and files attached to your tasks
- Leave comments and ask questions directly on tasks
- Monitor the overall progress of [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) you're participating in
