## Finding and sharing guest task links

[Guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) task links provide external users access to specific [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) without requiring a Tallyfy account. These links remain valid even after the guest completes the task.

- Administrator or Standard [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) permissions

### Method 1: From the task menu

1. Navigate to the [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) containing the guest task
2. Locate the task assigned to the guest
3. Click the ellipsis (⋮) icon next to the task
4. Select **Copy Guest Link** from the dropdown menu
