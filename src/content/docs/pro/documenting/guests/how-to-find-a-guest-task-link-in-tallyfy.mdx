## Finding and sharing guest task links

Need to share a task with someone outside your company? [Guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) task links make it simple - they're web addresses that let external people access specific [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) without creating a Tallyfy account. No login required.

Here's the useful part: these links stay active even after the guest completes their task. Why? Sometimes you need to [reopen](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-can-i-re-open-a-completed-guest-task/) completed tasks.

### What you need
- The [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) must already be assigned to a [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) user
- You'll need Administrator or Standard [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) permissions

### Method 1: From the task itself

This is the quickest way when you're already looking at the task:

<Steps>
1. Go to the running [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) that contains the guest task.
2. Find the specific task assigned to the guest.
3. Click the menu icon (three dots â‹®) next to the task name.
4. Choose **Copy Guest Link** from the menu.
</Steps>

### Method 2: From the main guest list in Settings

Want to find links for multiple guests? Or can't remember which process contains their task? Use this method:

<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **[Guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/)**.
2. Find the guest user you need in the list.
3. Click **Copy Guest Link** in that guest's row.
</Steps>

### Sharing the link

Got the link? Perfect. Here's what happens next:

- Paste it anywhere - email, Slack, text message, carrier pigeon (okay, maybe not that last one)
- When the [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) clicks it, they'll land directly on their assigned task. No login screens, no password resets, no hassle.
- The link stays active as long as the task exists

That's it. Simple.
