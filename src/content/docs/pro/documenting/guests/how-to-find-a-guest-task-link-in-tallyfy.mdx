## Finding and sharing guest task links

[Guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) task links are URLs that let external people access specific [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) without a Tallyfy account. No login required.

These links stay active even after the guest completes their task, so you can [reopen](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-can-i-re-open-a-completed-guest-task/) completed tasks when needed.

### What you need
- The [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) must already be assigned to a [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/)
- You'll need Administrator or Standard [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) permissions

### Method 1: From the task itself

The quickest way when you're already looking at the task:

<Steps>
1. Go to the running [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) that contains the guest task.
2. Find the specific task assigned to the guest.
3. Click the menu icon (three dots) next to the task name.
4. Select **Copy Guest Link** from the menu.
</Steps>

### Method 2: From the guest list in Settings

Use this when you need links for multiple guests or can't remember which process contains their task:

<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **[Guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/)**.
2. Find the guest you need.
3. Click **Copy Guest Link** in that guest's row.
</Steps>

### Sharing the link

:::tip[Programmatic access to guest URLs]
You can also retrieve guest URLs programmatically through the Tallyfy API:
1. Query process tasks via the API
2. Extract the `taskUrls` array from the task's `owners` object
3. Send these URLs through your own email/SMS systems
4. Use webhooks to capture URLs when tasks are created
:::

Once you've copied the link:

- Paste it anywhere - email, Slack, text message
- When the [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) clicks it, they'll land directly on their assigned task - no login screens or password resets
- The link stays active as long as the task exists
