## Finding and sharing guest task links

[Guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) task links are special web addresses that let people outside your company access specific [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) without needing to create a Tallyfy account or log in. These links keep working even after the guest finishes the task (in case it needs to be [reopened](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-can-i-re-open-a-completed-guest-task/)).

### What you need
- A [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) must already be assigned to a [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) user.
- You need Administrator or Standard [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) permission.

### Method 1: From the task itself

<Steps>
1. Go to the running [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) that contains the guest task.
2. Find the specific task assigned to the guest.
3. Click the menu icon (three dots â‹®) next to the task name.
4. Choose **Copy Guest Link** from the menu.
</Steps>

### Method 2: From the main guest list in Settings

If you want to see or copy links for any guest:

<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **[Guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/)**.
2. Find the guest user you need in the list.
3. Click **Copy Guest Link** in that guest's row.
</Steps>

### Sharing the link

Once you copy the link:
- You can paste it into an email, chat message, or anywhere else you communicate with the guest.
- The [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) can click this link to go directly to their assigned task without logging in.
- The link will keep working for the entire time the task exists.
