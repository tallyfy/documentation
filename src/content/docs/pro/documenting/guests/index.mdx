## How do guests work in Tallyfy for external collaboration?

Guests in Tallyfy enable integrated client-facing forms and tasks that can be tracked as part of a larger workflow. External individuals including clients, suppliers, contractors, or business partners can complete specific tasks and submit forms within your workflows without requiring full Tallyfy accounts. With unlimited guest access at no additional cost, you can seamlessly integrate external participation into your workflows.

This capability allows organizations to include client-facing forms and tasks as integral parts of their workflows, ensuring external inputs are tracked alongside internal processes.

:::tip[Member vs. Guest: Employee Badge vs. Visitor Pass]
Here's an easy way to think about the difference:

- **[Member](/products/pro/documenting/members/):** Like an **employee** with a company **ID badge**. They log into Tallyfy, have a specific role (Admin, Standard, or Light), and can access different parts of Tallyfy based on their role, just like an employee uses their badge to get into different office areas
- **Guest:** Like a **visitor** given a temporary **visitor pass** for one specific meeting or task. They don't get a full login or badge. Their pass is the unique *forever link* sent in their email. This link lets them access *only* the specific task they need to work on, like a visitor pass only works for one specific room. They can't access other tasks or processes

This lets you work with outside people on specific tasks without giving them access to your whole Tallyfy account.

### How can I assign workflow tasks to external guests?

When designing a process template, you can create integrated client-facing forms and tasks by assigning specific steps to external guests. This ensures external participation is tracked as part of your larger workflow:

- **Specific individuals or teams** within your organization for internal workflow steps
- **Designated job titles** (such as "Account Manager" or "Project Lead") for role-based assignments
- **External guests** (clients and partners) who complete client-facing forms and tasks integrated into your workflow

This assignment flexibility ensures that client-facing elements are seamlessly tracked as part of your larger workflow while maintaining internal oversight and control.

### What essential security and access features does guest functionality provide?

#### How does secure access work for guest users?
*   **Unique Access Links**: Each guest receives a private, unique web link for their client-facing forms and tasks. This permanent "forever link" remains constant unless the guest's email address changes or an internal member resets it.
*   **Frictionless Access**: Guests access their integrated tasks directly through their unique link without requiring account creation or login credentials, ensuring maximum ease of use for client-facing interactions.

This approach eliminates barriers to client participation while maintaining security through unique, personalized access methods.

#### What visibility and delegation capabilities do guests have?
*   **Controlled Visibility**: Guests view only their specific client-facing forms and tasks, not the complete process workflow. In a 20-step process with 2 client-facing tasks, guests see only those 2 relevant steps, maintaining confidentiality of your larger workflow.
*   **Flexible Task Delegation**: Guests can reassign their client-facing tasks to other external individuals (such as colleagues within their organization) by adding alternative email addresses as task assignees.

This selective visibility ensures client-facing elements are integrated into your workflow while protecting internal process details.

#### How does internal oversight work with guest assignments?
*   **Mandatory Internal Assignment**: Every client-facing task must include at least one internal member assignment. This ensures guest activities are tracked as part of the larger workflow with proper organizational oversight.
*   **Automated Communication**: Tallyfy automatically sends task reminder emails to guests for their client-facing forms and tasks, eliminating manual follow-up requirements and ensuring consistent communication.

This dual-assignment approach ensures that client-facing forms and tasks are properly tracked as integrated parts of your larger workflow process.

#### What customization and management options are available for guests?
*   **Email Customization**: Guests can configure email frequency preferences (including daily digest options) and manage their communication settings independently based on their preferences.
*   **Communication History**: View comprehensive email history for any guest through Settings > Guests for complete interaction tracking and audit purposes.
*   **Language Flexibility**: Guests can modify display language preferences within Tallyfy, including task instructions when automatic translation is configured.

These self-service capabilities ensure that guests can customize their experience while providing administrators with comprehensive tracking and management tools.
