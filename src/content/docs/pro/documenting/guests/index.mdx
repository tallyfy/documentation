## How do guests work in Tallyfy for external collaboration?

Guests in Tallyfy represent external individuals outside your organization, including clients, suppliers, contractors, or business partners who need to complete specific tasks or fill out designated form fields within your workflows. Tallyfy gives unlimited guest access at no additional cost, enabling seamless external collaboration without licensing restrictions.

This capability lets organizations include external stakeholders in their workflows without requiring them to have full Tallyfy accounts or access to internal systems.

:::tip[Member vs. Guest: Employee Badge vs. Visitor Pass]
Here's an easy way to think about the difference:

- **[Member](/products/pro/documenting/members/):** Like an **employee** with a company **ID badge**. They log into Tallyfy, have a specific role (Admin, Standard, or Light), and can access different parts of Tallyfy based on their role, just like an employee uses their badge to get into different office areas
- **Guest:** Like a **visitor** given a temporary **visitor pass** for one specific meeting or task. They don't get a full login or badge. Their pass is the unique *forever link* sent in their email. This link lets them access *only* the specific task they need to work on, like a visitor pass only works for one specific room. They can't access other tasks or processes

This lets you work with outside people on specific tasks without giving them access to your whole Tallyfy account.

### How can I assign workflow tasks to external guests?

When designing a process template, you determine task assignments for each workflow step during the template creation phase. Tallyfy offers flexible assignment options to accommodate both internal and external collaboration needs:

- **Specific individuals or teams** within your organization for internal workflow steps
- **Designated job titles** (such as "Account Manager" or "Project Lead") for role-based assignments
- **External guests** (individuals outside your company) who need to complete specific workflow tasks

This assignment flexibility ensures that workflows can seamlessly incorporate external stakeholders while maintaining internal oversight and control.

### What essential security and access features does guest functionality provide?

#### How does secure access work for guest users?
*   **Unique Access Links**: Each guest receives a private, unique web link sent to their email address. This permanent "forever link" remains constant unless the guest's email address changes or an internal member resets it.
*   **Frictionless Access**: Guests access tasks directly through their unique link without requiring account creation or login credentials, ensuring maximum ease of use for external collaborators.

This approach eliminates barriers to external participation while maintaining security through unique, personalized access methods.

#### What visibility and delegation capabilities do guests have?
*   **Controlled Visibility**: Guests view only tasks specifically assigned to them, not the complete process workflow. In a 20-step process with 2 guest-assigned tasks, guests see only those 2 relevant steps, maintaining process confidentiality.
*   **Flexible Task Delegation**: Guests can reassign their tasks to other external individuals (such as colleagues within their organization) by adding alternative email addresses as task assignees.

This selective visibility approach protects internal process details while providing guests with the information they need to complete their specific responsibilities.

#### How does internal oversight work with guest assignments?
*   **Mandatory Internal Assignment**: Every guest-assigned task must include at least one internal member assignment. This internal contact ensures organizational oversight, comment visibility, and notification management.
*   **Automated Communication**: Tallyfy automatically sends task reminder emails to guests, eliminating manual follow-up requirements and ensuring consistent communication.

This dual-assignment approach ensures that internal team members maintain oversight and communication channels with external guests throughout the workflow process.

#### What customization and management options are available for guests?
*   **Email Customization**: Guests can configure email frequency preferences (including daily digest options) and manage their communication settings independently based on their preferences.
*   **Communication History**: View comprehensive email history for any guest through Settings > Guests for complete interaction tracking and audit purposes.
*   **Language Flexibility**: Guests can modify display language preferences within Tallyfy, including task instructions when automatic translation is configured.

These self-service capabilities ensure that guests can customize their experience while providing administrators with comprehensive tracking and management tools.
