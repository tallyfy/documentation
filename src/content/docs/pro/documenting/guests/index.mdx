### What are guests in Tallyfy?

[Guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) are people outside your company (like clients or suppliers) who you need to complete specific [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) or fill out certain [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/). You can have unlimited guests for free in Tallyfy.

:::tip[Member vs. Guest: Employee Badge vs. Visitor Pass]
Here's an easy way to think about the difference:

- **[Member](/products/pro/documenting/members/):** Like an **employee** with a company **ID badge**. They log into Tallyfy, have a specific role (Admin, Standard, or Light), and can access different parts of Tallyfy based on their role, just like an employee uses their badge to get into different office areas.
- **Guest:** Like a **visitor** given a temporary **visitor pass** for one specific meeting or task. They don't get a full login or badge. Their pass is the unique *forever link* sent in their email. This link lets them access *only* the specific task they need to work on, like a visitor pass only works for one specific room. They can't access other tasks or processes.

This lets you work with outside people on specific tasks without giving them access to your whole Tallyfy account.
:::

When you build a process [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), you decide who does each step. You can assign a step to:

- Specific people or groups.
- A [job title](/products/pro/documenting/templates/edit-templates/understanding-assignment-types/) (like "Account Manager").
- A **guest** (someone outside your company).

Key things to know about guests:

*   A [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) gets a private, unique web [link](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-to-find-a-guest-task-link-in-tallyfy/) sent to their email. This link is sometimes called a *forever link* because it doesn't change unless the guest's email changes or a [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) resets it.
*   Guests use this link to do their tasks. They don't need to sign up or log in, making it easy for them.
*   Guests only see the specific [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) assigned to them, not the whole [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). If a process has 20 steps but only 2 are assigned to a guest, they will only see those 2 steps.
*   Guests can pass their task on to another guest if needed (e.g., if a client needs someone else in their company to handle it). They do this by adding the other person's email as an assignee on the task.
*   A [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) assigned to a guest must *also* have at least one internal [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) assigned. This member acts as the internal contact, ensuring someone inside your company sees comments or gets notified.
*   Tallyfy automatically emails guests reminders about their tasks. You don't need to chase them manually.
*   Guests can choose how often they get summary emails (daily digest) and manage their email settings.
*   You can see a history of emails sent to a guest in **Settings** > **Guests**.
*   Guests can change the display [language](/products/pro/miscellaneous/how-can-i-translate-content-in-tallyfy/) in Tallyfy, including the task instructions (if you have automatic translation set up).
