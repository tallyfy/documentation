### What are guests in Tallyfy?

[Guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) are unlimited and free on Tallyfy. Guests are designed to be used for assigning transient people a one-time set of [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) or [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to fill out and complete.

:::tip[Member vs. Guest: Employee Badge vs. Visitor Pass]
Think of the difference like this:

- **[Member](/products/pro/documenting/members/):** Like a full-time **employee** with a company **ID badge**. They log in, have a specific role (Administrator, Standard, Light), and access Tallyfy based on that role and permissions, similar to how an employee accesses different parts of an office building.
- **Guest:** Like a **visitor** or contractor given a specific **visitor pass** for a particular task or meeting. They don't need a full login or ID badge. Their pass (the unique *forever link* sent via email) grants them direct access *only* to the specific room (task) they need to be in. They can complete their work there but cannot wander the halls or access other areas (other tasks or processes).

This allows collaboration with external people (clients, suppliers, contractors) on specific tasks without giving them broad access to your Tallyfy organization.
:::

When you are documenting any [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), like a procedure - you need to make a decision on who that step is assigned to. You can assign a step to:

- **A fixed set of people** - this can include groups
- **A [job title](/products/pro/documenting/templates/edit-templates/understanding-assignment-types/)**. For example - "Project Manager"
- **A guest**. This explicitly indicates a task is for a guest. A guest is someone outside your company - like a client.

Important points about guests:

* A [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) gets a private [_forever link_](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-to-find-a-guest-task-link-in-tallyfy/) which is unique to their email address. The _forever link_ never changes if the guest email address never changes. A [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) can reset the _forever link_ if you like.
* A guest uses Tallyfy via their _forever link_. They never need to signup or login, which removes extra friction and barriers to engagement.
* A guest can only see the specific [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) they are assigned to - not other tasks within the [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). For example, let's say a process has 25 tasks and 3 of those tasks are assigned to a specific guest. The guest will only see the 3 tasks assigned to their email address.
* A guest can delegate a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to another guest by adding assignees to a task. This is very useful for example, when a customer wants to delegate a task or a form to someone else within their company. It helps people outside your company self-organize to get things done.
* A [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) assigned to a guest must _always_ have at least one [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) assigned to it as well. The reason is that the member acts as a chaperone and comments on the task notify someone within the company, instead of nobody being made aware of them.
* A guest is automatically notified and reminded of their assignments. You don't need to do anything manually. Just enter their email address, and Tallyfy handles the rest.
* A guest can set their own daily digest frequency and email preferences.
* You can see logs of which emails a guest received in **Settings > Guests**
* A guest can change the [language](/products/pro/miscellaneous/how-can-i-translate-content-in-tallyfy/) of the UI and the language of content within Tallyfy (if you've enabled a language [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) like Azure AI)
