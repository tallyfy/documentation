## Guest access for external collaboration

Guests let you include clients, suppliers, and partners in your workflows without giving them full Tallyfy accounts. They complete specific tasks through secure email links - completely free with unlimited access. This makes guests ideal for [client onboarding](https://tallyfy.com/solutions/client-onboarding-software/) where external people need to participate.

Example: You're running a 20-step approval process, but steps 5 and 12 need client input. Guests complete their parts right within your workflow. Everything stays tracked in one place.

:::tip[Member vs. Guest: Employee badge vs. visitor pass]
- **[Member](/products/pro/documenting/members/):** Like an **employee** with a company **ID badge**. They log into Tallyfy, have a specific role (Admin, Standard, or Light), and can access different areas based on their role
- **Guest:** Like a **visitor** with a temporary **visitor pass**. They don't get a full login. Their pass is the unique *forever link[^1]* sent via email. This link gives access *only* to the specific task they need to work on. They can't see other tasks or processes

Guests participate in specific tasks without getting access to your whole Tallyfy account.

### Assigning tasks to guests

Assign any step to an email address outside your organization - that person becomes a guest.

When building your template, you've got three assignment options:

- **Specific people or teams** in your organization
- **Job titles** like "Account Manager" or "Project Lead"
- **External email addresses** for clients and partners who need to complete certain steps

Every guest task must also have an internal assignee. You need someone inside your organization keeping tabs on external participation.

### Security and access

#### Secure access links
- **Unique forever links**: Each guest gets a private link to access tasks. It stays the same unless you change their email or manually reset it via **Settings > Guests**. No passwords needed.
- **Direct access**: Click the link, complete the task. No account creation, no login screens.

#### Visibility and delegation
- **Controlled visibility**: Guests only see their assigned tasks - nothing else. Your internal workflow stays confidential. (If you make a process [public](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/make-a-process-public/), guests can see everything in the Tracker view.)
- **Task delegation**: Guests can reassign their tasks to colleagues by adding their email addresses.

#### Internal oversight
- **Mandatory internal assignment**: Every guest task needs an internal assignee too. Someone in your organization always has visibility into external tasks.
- **Automated reminders**: Tallyfy sends reminder emails automatically. You don't need to chase clients for responses.

#### Customization and management
- **Daily digest**: Guests can switch to daily digest emails if they prefer fewer notifications.
- **Communication history**: Check what emails went to a specific guest at **Settings > Guests** - every reminder, every notification. Useful for audit trails.
- **Language settings**: Guests can change their display language (`app_language`) and content language (`content_language`) through their preferences.

### Guest email preferences

Guests have limited email control compared to members.

**What guests CAN control**:
- Daily digest emails (on/off) - combine all notifications into one daily summary
- Display language and content language preferences

**What guests CANNOT control**:
- Individual task notification emails - always sent when tasks are assigned
- Comment notification emails - always sent when someone comments
- Deadline reminder emails - always sent as deadlines approach

If a guest needs more email control, consider:
- Converting them to a Light member[^2] role
- Using member-level permissions instead of guest access

### Guest task completion

**How guests complete tasks**:
- Email notifications include a direct link to the task
- The green **Complete** button is prominently displayed
- Automatic reminders follow your configured cadence
- Task descriptions can include step-by-step instructions

**Tips for clearer guest tasks**:
- Add explicit instructions like "Click the green Complete button when done"
- Use numbered steps for complex actions
- Include screenshots or examples when helpful
- Set appropriate deadlines to create urgency

:::tip[Alternative: Expiring tasks for optional guest work]
For low-priority guest tasks that might not get completed, use **expiring tasks** that auto-complete on the deadline:

1. In the template, set the task type to **Expiring**
2. Set an appropriate deadline (e.g., 3 days)
3. The task automatically completes if the guest doesn't respond
4. Good for optional feedback requests or "nice to have" input

This prevents processes from getting stuck on unresponsive external parties. [Learn more about task types](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-types-of-tasks-can-i-create-with-tallyfy/).
