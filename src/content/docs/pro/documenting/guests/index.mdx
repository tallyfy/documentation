## What are guests in Tallyfy?

[Guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) are unlimited and free on Tallyfy. Guests are designed to be used for assigning transient people a one-time set of [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) or [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to fill out and complete.

When you are documenting any [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), like a procedure - you need to make a decision on who that step is assigned to. You can assign a step to:

- **A fixed set of people** - this can include groups
- **A [job title](/products/pro/documenting/templates/edit-templates/understanding-assignment-types/)**. For example - "Project Manager"
- **A guest**. This explicitly indicates a task is for a guest. A guest is someone outside your company - like a client.

Important points about guests:

* A [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) gets a private [_forever link_](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-to-find-a-guest-task-link-in-tallyfy/) which is unique to their email address. The _forever link_ never changes if the guest email address never changes. A [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) can reset the _forever link_ if you like.
* A guest uses Tallyfy via their _forever link_. They never need to signup or login, which removes extra friction and barriers to engagement.
* A guest can only see the specific [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) they are assigned to - not other tasks within the [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). For example, let's say a process has 25 tasks and 3 of those tasks are assigned to a specific guest. The guest will only see the 3 tasks assigned to their email address.
* A guest can delegate a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to another guest by adding assignees to a task. This is very useful for example, when a customer wants to delegate a task or a form to someone else within their company. It helps people outside your company self-organize to get things done.
* A [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) assigned to a guest must _always_ have at least one [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) assigned to it as well. The reason is that the member acts as a chaperone and comments on the task notify someone within the company, instead of nobody being made aware of them.
* A guest is automatically notified and reminded of their assignments. You don't need to do anything manually. Just enter their email address, and Tallyfy handles the rest.
* A guest can set their own daily digest frequency and email preferences.
* You can see logs of which emails a guest received in **Settings > Guests**
* A guest can change the [language](/products/pro/miscellaneous/how-can-i-translate-content-in-tallyfy/) of the UI and the language of content within Tallyfy (if you've enabled a language [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) like Azure AI)
