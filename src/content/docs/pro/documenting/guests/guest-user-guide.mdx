## How to assign, manage, and convert guests

Guests are external people - clients, vendors, contractors - who can complete tasks in your workflows without creating a Tallyfy account. They're free and unlimited on paid plans.

### Guests vs. members

| Feature | Guest users | Members |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| Cost | Free, unlimited | Paid seat |
| Account needed | No | Yes |
| Can create templates | No | Yes (Standard/Admin) |
| Can launch processes | No | Yes |
| Task visibility | Only assigned tasks | All tasks (based on role) |
| Authentication | Secure email link | Login credentials |
| Can post comments | Yes (unless disabled per task) | Yes |

### How to assign tasks to guests

Two options:

1. **In a template** (repeatable processes):
   - Select a step in your template
   - Go to the **Assignment** tab
   - Choose "Guest" as the assignment type
   - Enter the guest's email address

2. **In an active process** (on-the-fly):
   - Open the task you want to assign
   - Click **Reassign**
   - Select "Assign to guest"
   - Enter the guest's email address
   - Click **Save**

When assigned, guests receive an email with a secure link to their task[^1]. No passwords. No account creation.

### Guest notifications and tracking

You can:
- Customize the email notification message
- Set up reminder notifications for uncompleted tasks
- Track when guests access their tasks (via the `last_accessed_at` timestamp)

The Tracker view shows which guest tasks are complete, pending, or in progress. Guests can also see @mentions directed at them in task comments.

### Common guest use cases

**Collecting information from customers** - Use guest tasks to gather data through forms, collect document uploads, get approvals, or request feedback.

**Involving external experts** - Legal reviews, technical consultations, vendor approvals. Guests contribute to specific steps without full user accounts.

**Onboarding new clients** - Create a process that walks clients through every step: submitting documents, filling out forms, and receiving information as they go.

### Document collection workflows

Great for loan applications, mortgage processing, or compliance checks. Set up tasks where guests can:
- See required documents with explanations
- Upload files directly to their tasks
- Check off completed items
- Get clear instructions at every step

### Troubleshooting guest access

#### Guest can't access their task

1. Double-check the email address for typos
2. Guest emails can't match your organization's domain. If your org uses `mydomain.com`, guests with `@mydomain.com` emails won't work - they'll need a different email address
3. Resend the invitation from the task view
4. Confirm the process is still active (completed processes lock everyone out)
5. Verify the task hasn't been reassigned

The domain restriction (#2) catches most people.

#### Guest completed a task by mistake

1. Go to the completed task
2. Click **Reopen** in the task menu
3. The task returns to active status
4. The guest can access it again with their original link

#### Changing a guest's email

Click **Reassign** on the task, enter the correct email, and click **Save**. Tallyfy sends a fresh invitation to the new address. The old link stops working immediately.

### Security and privacy

#### What guests can and can't see

**Guests CAN see:**
- Their assigned tasks
- Attachments and fields within those tasks
- Comments where they're @mentioned

**Guests CANNOT see:**
- Other tasks in the process
- Your templates or organization settings
- Member information or other processes

:::warning[Important security consideration]
When you make a process **[Public to the world](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/make-a-process-public/)**, guests can see **all tasks** in the Tracker view - including tasks assigned to other guests or members.

Keep processes private when:
- Different guests shouldn't see each other's work
- Task titles or descriptions contain sensitive information
- You need strict task-level access control
:::

#### Guest security tips

- Share only what's necessary in guest tasks
- Use form fields to collect information instead of exposing sensitive details
- Keep confidential data out of task descriptions and attachments
- Use the **Reset link** option in **Settings > Guests** to invalidate old guest links when needed
- Review and remove guest access when projects finish

### Converting between guests and members

#### Converting a guest to a member

You need Administrator permissions and an available member seat.

##### Method 1: Convert from the Guests list

<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Guests**.
2. Find the guest you want to change in the list.
3. Click **Convert to member** in that guest's row.
4. Tallyfy moves them to Members and sends a password setup email.
</Steps>

##### Method 2: Invite as a member

1. Go to **Settings > Members**
2. Click **Invite member**
3. Enter the guest's email address
4. Select the role (Standard, Light[^2], or Administrator)
5. Click **Send**

##### What happens after conversion
- They receive a temporary password email
- They're initially set as a Standard member (changeable later)
- They occupy a paid member seat
- Adjust their role in **Settings > Organization > Members**

#### Converting a member to a guest

The member must be disabled first. Then:

1. Go to **Settings > Members**
2. Find the disabled member
3. Click the three-dot menu and select **Convert to guest**
4. Confirm the change

They can still complete guest tasks but won't have member privileges.

### Advanced guest features

#### Guest form submission without task assignment

Create a process with a form, generate a shareable link, and send it out. Anyone with the link can submit the form - useful for surveys, registrations, or feedback collection.

#### Custom branding for guest interfaces

Customize the guest experience with your logo, welcome messages, and branded email notifications. Task descriptions can reflect your organization's voice and style.

[^1]: Links contain a unique guest_code token that authenticates without requiring account credentials
[^2]: Light users have view-only permissions and can't complete tasks, unlike guest users who can complete assigned tasks
