### Understanding guest users

- External participants who don't need a Tallyfy account
- Unlimited and free to include in your processes
- Limited to completing only tasks assigned specifically to them
- Identified by their email address

### Inviting and managing guests

#### How to assign tasks to guests

1. **In a template**:
   - Select a step in your template
   - Go to the **Assignment** tab
   - Select "Guest" as the assignment type
   - Enter the guest's email address

2. **In an active process**:
   - Navigate to the task you want to assign
   - Click **Reassign**
   - Select "Assign to guest"
   - Enter the guest's email address
   - Click **Save**

#### Guest notification options

When you assign a task to a guest:
- The guest receives an email notification with a link to the task
- You can customize the email notification message
- You can set up reminder notifications for uncompleted tasks
- Guests don't need to remember passwords or login credentials

#### Tracking guest progress

To monitor guest task completion:
- View the process in the Tracker view to see all task statuses
- Check the task history to see when guests accessed their tasks
- Set up email notifications to be alerted when guests complete tasks
- Use comments to communicate with guests on specific tasks

### Common guest scenarios

#### Collecting information from customers

Use guest tasks to:
- Gather customer information via forms
- Collect document uploads
- Get approvals or signatures
- Request feedback or reviews

#### Involving external experts or partners

Invite external participants to:
- Provide specialized input
- Review documents or deliverables
- Approve decisions or changes
- Contribute expertise to specific steps

#### Onboarding new clients

Create onboarding processes that:
- Guide clients through initial setup steps
- Collect required documentation
- Provide information at each stage
- Ensure all necessary information is captured

### Troubleshooting guest access issues

#### Guest can't access their task

If a guest reports they can't access their task:
1. Verify the email address is correct
2. Check if the task link has expired
3. Resend the invitation from the task view
4. Ensure the process is still active and not completed
5. Check if the task has been reassigned to someone else

#### Guest completed a task by mistake

If a guest mistakenly completes a task:
1. Navigate to the completed task
2. Click the **Reopen** option in the task menu
3. The task will return to "In Progress" status
4. The guest can then access it again to complete it properly

#### Changing guest email address

To change the email address for a guest:
1. Go to the task assigned to the guest
2. Click **Reassign**
3. Enter the new guest email address
4. Click **Save**
5. A new invitation will be sent to the updated email address

### Security and privacy considerations

#### Guest data access limitations

Guests can only see:
- The specific tasks assigned to them
- Any attachments or fields within those tasks
- Comments directed to them using @mentions

Guests cannot access:
- Other tasks in the process
- Templates or organization settings
- Member information or other processes
- Historical data outside their assigned tasks

#### Best practices for guest security

- Only share necessary information in guest tasks
- Use form fields to collect specific information rather than sharing sensitive details
- Avoid including confidential information in task descriptions or attachments
- Consider setting expiration times for guest task links
- Review and delete guest access when no longer needed

### Converting between guests and members

#### Converting a guest to a member

If a guest needs more extensive access:
1. Navigate to **Settings > Members**
2. Click **Invite Member**
3. Enter the guest's email address
4. Select the appropriate role
5. Send the invitation

The guest will receive an invitation to create a full member account.

#### Converting a member to a guest

If a member should be changed to a guest:
1. Go to **Settings > Members**
2. Find the member you want to convert
3. Click the three dots menu and select **Convert to guest**
4. Confirm the change

The person will no longer have member access but can still be assigned guest tasks.

### Advanced guest features

#### Guest form submission without task assignment

You can allow guests to submit forms without being directly assigned:
1. Create a process with a form
2. Generate a shareable link
3. Distribute the link to multiple potential respondents
4. Collect form submissions from anyone with the link

#### Custom branding for guest interfaces

Customize the guest experience with:
- Your organization's logo
- Custom welcome messages
- Branded email notifications
- Customized task descriptions and instructions

By effectively managing guest users, you can include external participants in your workflows without additional cost while maintaining security and process integrity.
