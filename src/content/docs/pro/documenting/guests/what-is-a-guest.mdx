## What is a guest in Tallyfy?

[Guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) represent external stakeholders outside your organization who require access to complete specific [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) within Tallyfy workflows.

Guests operate without requiring full Tallyfy accounts or paid subscription seats, enabling cost-effective external collaboration while maintaining security boundaries around organizational data and processes.

### What are the key characteristics of Tallyfy guests?

Guests provide secure external collaboration capabilities with carefully designed access controls and cost-effective implementation:

- **External Stakeholders**: Typically clients, suppliers, contractors, or other third-party collaborators requiring limited workflow participation
- **Cost-Effective Access**: Unlimited and free guest access enables scalable external collaboration without subscription cost constraints
- **Secure Task Access**: Guests utilize unique [task links](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-to-find-a-guest-task-link-in-tallyfy/) delivered via email, eliminating login requirements while maintaining security
- **Limited Visibility**: Guests access exclusively their assigned tasks, ensuring focused collaboration without broader system exposure
- **Data Protection**: Complete isolation from other organizational [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) and data maintains security and privacy boundaries

### Common ways to use Guests

- Getting approvals from clients.
- Asking external people to review documents.
- Getting information from suppliers for purchasing.
- Collecting feedback from customers.
- Getting sign-offs from partners or stakeholders.

### Member vs Guest comparison

#### What Members can do
- Log into Tallyfy with an email and password.
- Create and manage process [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) (depending on role).
- [Start](/products/pro/launching/) and track [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).
- See information across the whole organization (depending on role).
- [Invite](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-to-invite-and-activate-members-on-tallyfy/) other members and guests.
- Use a paid seat in your company's subscription.

#### What Guests can do
- Use unique links to access specific [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) assigned to them.
- Fill out [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) in their tasks.
- Upload files needed for their tasks.
- Add comments *only* on the tasks assigned to them.
- See their list of assigned tasks on the [guest dashboard](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-can-guests-monitor-their-processes-on-tallyfy/).
- Get email notifications about their tasks.

### What Guests cannot do
- Re-open [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) they have already completed.
- Change task details (like due dates) or who is assigned.
- See process [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) or other [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) they aren't part of.
- [Start processes](/products/pro/launching/).
- See tasks assigned to other people.
- Log into the main Tallyfy website or app.
- Use email addresses from the same domain as your organization (e.g., if your company uses `mydomain.com`, guest emails cannot be from `mydomain.com`).
- (Note: Only one guest email can be initially assigned per task, but guests can delegate their tasks to other external individuals through self-delegation).
