## Understanding guests in Tallyfy

[Guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) are people outside your company who need to complete specific [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in Tallyfy. They don't need a full Tallyfy account or paid subscription seat.

### Key things about Guests

- **Who they are**: Usually people outside your organization (like clients, suppliers, or contractors).
- **Cost**: Unlimited and free â€“ you can add as many as you need.
- **How they access tasks**: They use unique [task links](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-to-find-a-guest-task-link-in-tallyfy/) sent to their email, no login needed.
- **What they see**: They can *only* see and work on the specific tasks assigned to them.
- **Security**: They cannot access other parts of your Tallyfy account, keeping your other [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) and data private.

### Common ways to use Guests

- Getting approvals from clients.
- Asking external people to review documents.
- Getting information from suppliers for purchasing.
- Collecting feedback from customers.
- Getting sign-offs from partners or stakeholders.
