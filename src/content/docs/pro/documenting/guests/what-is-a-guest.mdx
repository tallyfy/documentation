## What is a guest in Tallyfy?

[Guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) are people outside your company - clients, suppliers, contractors - who need to complete specific [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in your workflows. They don't need Tallyfy accounts or paid seats.

Here's the brilliant part: You get unlimited guest access completely free. Your guests receive secure email links to their tasks, complete them, and that's it. No logins, no complexity.

### What are the key characteristics of Tallyfy guests?

Think of guests as having a VIP pass to just their part of your workflow - nothing more, nothing less. Here's what makes the guest system work so well:

- **External Stakeholders**: Your clients, suppliers, contractors, and business partners who need to participate in specific parts of your workflows
- **Cost-Effective Access**: Unlimited guests at zero cost. Yes, really - whether you have 10 or 10,000 external collaborators, it won't affect your subscription
- **Secure Task Access**: Each guest gets unique [task links](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-to-find-a-guest-task-link-in-tallyfy/) via email. Click the link, complete the task - it's that straightforward
- **Limited Visibility**: Guests only see their assigned tasks. They can't wander around your other [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) or access company data
- **Data Protection**: Your organizational information stays completely isolated from guest access. Perfect security boundaries

### Common ways to use Guests

You'll find guests perfect for:
- Getting approvals from clients
- Asking external people to review documents
- Collecting information from suppliers for purchasing
- Gathering customer feedback
- Getting sign-offs from partners or stakeholders

### Member vs Guest comparison

Here's how members and guests differ in Tallyfy:

#### What Members can do
- Log into Tallyfy with an email and password
- Create and manage process [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) (depending on their role)
- [Start](/products/pro/launching/) and track [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)
- View information across the whole organization (based on their role)
- [Invite](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-to-invite-and-activate-members-on-tallyfy/) other members and guests
- Take up a paid seat in your subscription

#### What Guests can do
- Access specific [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) through unique email links - no login needed
- Complete [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) in their assigned tasks
- Upload any files their tasks require
- Add comments on their tasks (and only their tasks)
- View all their assigned tasks on the [guest dashboard](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-can-guests-monitor-their-processes-on-tallyfy/)
- Receive email notifications about task updates

### What Guests cannot do
- Re-open [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) once they've completed them
- Modify task details like due dates or assignments
- Access process [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) or view [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) they're not involved in
- [Start new processes](/products/pro/launching/)
- See tasks assigned to other people
- Log into the main Tallyfy platform
- Use email addresses from your organization's domain (if your company uses `mydomain.com`, guests can't use `mydomain.com` emails)

*Important note*: You can initially assign only one guest email per task. But here's a clever feature - guests can delegate their tasks to other external people through self-delegation.
