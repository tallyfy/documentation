## What is a guest in Tallyfy?

[Guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) are people outside your company - clients, suppliers, contractors - who need to complete specific [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in your workflows. They don't need Tallyfy accounts or paid seats.

Here's the brilliant part: Your guests receive secure email links to their tasks, complete them, and that's it. No logins, no complexity.

### Key characteristics of Tallyfy guests

Think of guests as having a VIP pass to just their part of your workflow - nothing more, nothing less. Here's what makes the guest system work so well:

- **External Stakeholders**: Your clients, suppliers, contractors, and business partners who need to participate in specific parts of your workflows
- **External Access**: Guests can participate without needing internal accounts
- **Secure Task Access**: Each guest gets unique [task links](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-to-find-a-guest-task-link-in-tallyfy/) via email. Click the link, complete the task - it's that straightforward
- **Limited Visibility**: Guests only see their assigned tasks. They can't wander around your other [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) or access company data
- **Data Protection**: Your organizational information stays completely isolated from guest access. Perfect security boundaries

### Common ways to use Guests

You'll find guests perfect for:
- Getting approvals from clients
- Asking external people to review documents
- Collecting information from suppliers for purchasing
- Gathering customer feedback
- Getting sign-offs from partners or stakeholders

### Member vs Guest comparison

Here's how members and guests differ in Tallyfy:

#### What Members can do
- Log into Tallyfy with an email and password
- Create and manage process [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) (depending on their role)
- [Start](/products/pro/launching/) and track [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)
- View information across the whole organization (based on their role)
- [Invite](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-to-invite-and-activate-members-on-tallyfy/) other members and guests
- Take up a paid seat in your subscription

#### What Guests can do
- Access specific [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) through unique email links - no login needed
- Complete [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) in their assigned tasks
- Upload any files their tasks require
- Add comments on their tasks (and only their tasks)
- View all their assigned tasks on the [guest dashboard](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-can-guests-monitor-their-processes-on-tallyfy/)
- Receive email notifications about task updates

### What Guests cannot do
- Re-open [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) once they've completed them
- Modify task details like due dates or assignments
- Access process [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) or view [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) they're not involved in
- [Start new processes](/products/pro/launching/)
- See tasks assigned to other people
- Log into the main Tallyfy platform
- Use email addresses from your organization's domain (if your company uses `mydomain.com`, guests can't use `mydomain.com` emails)

*Important note*: You can initially assign only one guest email per task. But here's a clever feature - guests can delegate their tasks to other external people through self-delegation[^1].

### Guest vs Light vs Standard member comparison

Understanding the differences helps you choose the right access level for each person.

| Feature | Guest | Light Member | Standard Member |
|---------|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Email domain** | External only | Any domain | Any domain |
| **Login access** | No (email links only) | Yes | Yes |
| **Edit templates** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Archive processes** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ |
| **Complete tasks** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Receive notifications** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Pre-assign in templates** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **View all processes** | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Access type** | Guest | Member | Member |
| **Best for** | Clients, vendors, contractors | View-only employees | Process designers |

:::note[Contractors and access considerations]
**External contractors who work regularly with your organization** present an access decision. While they can be guests, guests have limitations - they can't see all processes or log in directly. If contractors need broader access or work on multiple processes regularly, they'll need Light member status. This ensures they can track their work across all assigned processes. Consider the contractor's involvement level when deciding between guest (limited access) and member (full access) status.
:::

:::important[Email domain restrictions]
**Guests must use external email addresses** - not your company domain. If your company uses `yourcompany.com`, you cannot assign `anyone@yourcompany.com` as a guest. They must be a Light or Standard member instead.

This restriction is especially important for SSO organizations where company emails automatically require member status.
