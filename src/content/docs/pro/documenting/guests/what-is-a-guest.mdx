## Understanding guests in Tallyfy

[Guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) are external users who can access and complete specific [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in Tallyfy without requiring full system access or a subscription.

### Key characteristics of Guests

- **Unlimited and free** - No limit on the number of guests you can add
- **No login required** - Access through unique [task links](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-to-find-a-guest-task-link-in-tallyfy/)
- **Task-specific access** - Can only see and interact with assigned tasks
- **Secure collaboration** - Cannot access your organization's other [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) or data
