## Adding editable fields to document templates

[Document templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) in Tallyfy use a "fill in the blanks" approach, where specific [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) are editable while the rest of the document remains read-only to maintain consistency.

### Prerequisites
- Access to create or edit document templates
- Understanding of which [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) should be editable in your document

### Types of editable fields

Tallyfy supports three main [field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) types for document templates:

1. **Short text** - For brief responses such as names, titles, or IDs
2. **Long text** - For paragraphs, descriptions, or detailed responses
3. **Date** - For capturing deadlines, start dates, or other time-based information

### Adding new fields

To add a new editable [field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to your document template:

1. Open the document template in edit mode
2. Position your cursor where the field should appear
3. Click **New Field** in the toolbar
4. Select the appropriate field type (Short text, Long text, or Date)
5. Give the field a descriptive name
6. Click **Add** to insert the field

### Reusing existing fields

To use the same [field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) in multiple locations within your document:

1. Position your cursor where you want to insert the field
2. Click **Existing fields** in the toolbar
3. Locate the field you want to reuse
4. Drag the field into the desired location in your document

### Field behavior in document templates

When a document template with [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) is [launched](/products/pro/launching/):
- Users are prompted to fill in the editable fields
- The same value automatically appears in all instances of that field
- The rest of the document remains read-only
- Completed documents maintain consistency in formatting and structure

### Best practices for document fields

- Use descriptive [field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) names that clearly indicate what information is needed
- Consider the field length needed when choosing between short and long text fields
- Group related fields together logically in the document
- Limit the number of editable fields to keep documents streamlined
- Test your [document template](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) by [launching](/products/pro/launching/) it before widespread use
