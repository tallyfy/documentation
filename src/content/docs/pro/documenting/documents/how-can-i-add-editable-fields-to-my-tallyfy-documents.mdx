## How to add editable fields to document templates

[Document templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) in Tallyfy work like smart forms - you fill in the blanks while the rest stays locked. This keeps every document consistent.

### Requirements
- Edit permissions for document templates.
- Know which parts of your document need editable [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) - what changes each time?

### Types of editable fields

Tallyfy's document editor supports three [field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) types:

1. **Short Text** - Names, titles, reference numbers.
2. **Long Text** - Paragraphs and detailed explanations.
3. **Date** - Deadlines, start dates, and similar.

### Adding new fields

<Steps>
1. Open the document template you want to edit.
2. Click where you want the field to appear.
3. Expand the **New Fields** section in the side panel.
4. Pick your field type (Short Text, Long Text, or Date).
5. Give it a clear name - "Customer Name" beats "Name" every time.
6. Click **Add** to insert the field.
</Steps>

### Reusing existing fields

You can place the same field in multiple spots without creating it twice:

<Steps>
1. Click where you want to add the existing field.
2. Expand the **Existing Fields** section in the side panel.
3. Search or browse to find the field you need.
4. Drag it into position in your document.
</Steps>

### How fields work in launched documents

When someone [launches](/products/pro/launching/) a document template with [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/):
- They fill in the editable fields. That's it.
- If the same field appears in multiple places, they enter it once and it populates everywhere.
- All other content stays locked.
- Documents come out consistent every time.

### Tips for using document fields

- **Name fields clearly.** "Customer Name" prevents confusion. "Name" causes headaches.
- **Match field size to content.** Short Text for company names, Long Text for detailed project descriptions.
- **Group related fields together.**
- **Don't go overboard.** Too many fields overwhelm users. Keep it focused.
- **Test first.** [Launch](/products/pro/launching/) your own [document template](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) before sharing it with others.
