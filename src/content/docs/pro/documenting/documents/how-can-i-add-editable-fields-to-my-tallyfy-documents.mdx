## How to add editable fields to document templates

[Document templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) in Tallyfy work like forms where you can fill in specific blanks ([fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/)). The rest of the document stays the same to keep everything consistent.

### Requirements
- You need permission to create or edit document templates.
- You should know which parts of your document need to be editable [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/).

### Types of editable fields

You can add three main types of editable [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to document templates:

1. **Short text** - For short answers like names, titles, or IDs.
2. **Long text** - For longer answers like paragraphs or descriptions.
3. **Date** - For picking dates like deadlines or start dates.

### Adding new fields

To add a new editable [field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to your document template:

<Steps>
1. Open the document template you want to edit.
2. Click where you want the field to go.
3. Click **New Field** in the toolbar above the document.
4. Choose the type of field you need (Short text, Long text, or Date).
5. Give the field a clear name so people know what to enter.
6. Click **Add** to put the field in the document.
</Steps>

### Reusing existing fields

If you need to use the same [field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) in several places in your document:

<Steps>
1. Click where you want to add the existing field.
2. Click **Existing fields** in the toolbar.
3. Find the field you want to use again in the list.
4. Drag that field into the spot you chose in the document.

### How fields work in launched documents

When someone uses ([launches](/products/pro/launching/)) a document template that has [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/):
- They will be asked to fill in the editable fields.
- If you used the same field multiple times, the value entered once will show up everywhere that field appears.
- The rest of the document cannot be changed.
- This keeps the final documents consistent in their look and structure.

### Tips for using document fields

- Give your [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) clear names so people understand what information to put in.
- Think about how much text someone might need to enter when deciding between short and long text fields.
- Put related fields close together in the document.
- Try not to add too many editable fields, to keep the document simple.
- Test your [document template](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) by [launching](/products/pro/launching/) it yourself before others use it widely.
