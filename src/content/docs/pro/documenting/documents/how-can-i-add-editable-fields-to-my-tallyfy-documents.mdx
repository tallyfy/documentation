## Adopt a "fill in the blanks" approach to recurring documents

Are you tired of trying to maintain consistency in your Word or Google Docs templates? With Tallyfy, you can say goodbye to the mess of countless variations and uncontrolled changes. Our document templates provide a solution by allowing you to add editable form fields while keeping the rest of the document read-only.

Gone are the days of manually customizing each template. Tallyfy lets you create snippets and embedded templates, enabling you to edit a single block of content once and have it reflected across all relevant templates and processes. It's like building with Lego bricks!

So how can you add editable fields to your document? It's simple!

To add a new field, click on _New Field_ and select the type of field you want to add to your document. You can add **Short text**, for something like the name of a client or a project, **Long text** for a description or notes and **Date** for a deadline or the current date!.

### Use existing fields in your document

Click on _Existing fields_ and drag the one you want to use into your document - they will fill in with whatever the value collected was - great for fields where you collect the data once e.g. "First Name" but then have to pull it into many different slots throughout the document without re-entering it again.
