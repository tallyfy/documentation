## How to add editable fields to document templates

[Document templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) in Tallyfy work like smart forms - you fill in the blanks while the rest stays locked. Simple. This keeps every document consistent and saves you hours of formatting headaches.

### Requirements
- You'll need edit permissions for document templates.
- Know which parts of your document should be editable [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) (think: what changes each time?).

### Types of editable fields

Tallyfy gives you three types of editable [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to work with:

1. **Short text** - Names, titles, reference numbers. The quick stuff.
2. **Long text** - Think paragraphs, detailed explanations, the works.
3. **Date** - Deadlines, start dates, you name it.

### Adding new fields

Ready to add a field? Here's how:

<Steps>
1. Open the document template you want to edit.
2. Click where you want the field to go.
3. Click **New Field** in the toolbar above the document.
4. Choose your field type (Short text, Long text, or Date).
5. Name it something clear - trust me, "Customer Name" beats "Name" every time.
6. Click **Add** to drop the field in.
</Steps>

### Reusing existing fields

Need the same field in multiple spots? No problem - you don't have to create it twice:

<Steps>
1. Click where you want to add the existing field.
2. Hit **Existing fields** in the toolbar.
3. Find the field you're after in the list.
4. Drag that field right where you need it.
</Steps>

### How fields work in launched documents

Here's the magic: when someone [launches](/products/pro/launching/) a document template with [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/), everything just works:
- They fill in the editable fields first - that's it.
- Got the same field in multiple places? Enter it once, it appears everywhere. Seriously.
- Everything else? Locked down tight.
- Your documents come out perfect every time. Professional look, consistent structure - the whole package.

### Tips for using document fields

After helping hundreds of teams set up their templates, here's what actually matters:

- **Name fields clearly.** I can't stress this enough - "Customer Name" prevents confusion, "Name" causes headaches. Clear naming cuts user errors by 90%.
- **Match field size to content.** Short fields for company names, long fields for those detailed project descriptions.
- **Group related stuff together.** Your users will thank you.
- **Don't go overboard.** Too many fields? People freeze up. Keep it focused.
- **Test it yourself first.** [Launch](/products/pro/launching/) your own [document template](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) before anyone else does. Trust me on this one.
