## How to add editable fields to document templates

[Document templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) in Tallyfy work like smart forms - you fill in specific blanks while keeping the rest unchanged. This approach maintains consistency across all your documents.

### Requirements
- You need edit permissions for document templates.
- You should identify which parts of your document need to be editable [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/).

### Types of editable fields

You can add three main types of editable [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to document templates:

1. **Short text** - Perfect for names, titles, or reference numbers.
2. **Long text** - Use this for paragraphs, detailed descriptions, or comments.
3. **Date** - Let users pick specific dates like deadlines or start dates.

### Adding new fields

To add a new editable [field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to your document template:

<Steps>
1. Open the document template you want to edit.
2. Click where you want the field to go.
3. Click **New Field** in the toolbar above the document.
4. Choose the type of field you need (Short text, Long text, or Date).
5. Give the field a clear name so people know what to enter.
6. Click **Add** to put the field in the document.
</Steps>

### Reusing existing fields

If you need to use the same [field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) in several places in your document:

<Steps>
1. Click where you want to add the existing field.
2. Click **Existing fields** in the toolbar.
3. Find the field you want to use again in the list.
4. Drag that field into the spot you chose in the document.
</Steps>

### How fields work in launched documents

When someone [launches](/products/pro/launching/) a document template with [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/), here's what happens:
- They'll fill in the editable fields first.
- Any field used multiple times gets filled automatically - enter it once, and it appears everywhere.
- Everything else stays locked to maintain consistency.
- Your final documents keep their professional look and structure.

### Tips for using document fields

- Name your [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) clearly - "Customer Name" beats "Name" every time.
- Consider text length needs: use short fields for titles, long fields for detailed explanations.
- Group related fields together for better user experience.
- Keep it simpleâ€”too many fields overwhelm users.
- Always test your [document template](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) by [launching](/products/pro/launching/) it yourself first.
