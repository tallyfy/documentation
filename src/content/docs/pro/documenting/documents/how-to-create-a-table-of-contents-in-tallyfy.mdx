## How automatic table of contents work in Tallyfy

Tallyfy automatically generates a table of contents from your headings - just add headings and watch the navigation build itself. No manual linking, no updating page numbers. Your [documents](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) and [procedure templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) become instantly navigable.

### What you need
- A document or procedure template open for editing
- Text you want to organize with headings

### How Tallyfy's table of contents is different from Word's

Remember fighting with Word's table of contents? Page numbers that won't update, manual refreshing, formatting that breaks? Tallyfy works differently:

- **Instant creation**: Add a heading - it appears in the navigation immediately
- **Live updates**: Change a heading and the table of contents updates in real-time
- **Screen-optimized**: Built for clicking and navigating, not printing
- **Zero maintenance**: Never manually update navigation again

### Creating a table of contents in Documents

Here's where it gets good - watch your table of contents build itself:

<Steps>
1. Highlight the text you want as a main section heading.
2. Click the formatting menu in your toolbar (might show **Normal text** or heading styles).
3. Choose **H1** to make it a main heading.

4. For sub-headings, highlight text in that subsection.
5. Pick **H2** (sits under H1) or **H3** (sits under H2) from the menu.

</Steps>

That's it. Your headings instantly appear in the table of contents panel as clickable links.

### Tips for using headings well

Want a table of contents that actually helps readers? Follow these rules:
- **H1** is for main sections only - think chapter titles
- **H2** goes inside H1 sections - your subchapters
- **H3** goes inside H2 sections (if you really need that level)
- Don't skip levels - no jumping from H1 to H3
- Keep headings short. Really short.

### Table of contents in Procedure templates

Procedure templates work a bit differently. You still get automatic navigation - you just access it through preview mode:

<Steps>
1. Open your procedure template.
2. Click **Preview** to see the user view.
3. Look for the table of contents icon in the top right (looks like stacked lines).

4. Click any heading to jump directly to that section.

</Steps>

### Why automatic table of contents matter

Think about the last time you scrolled endlessly through a long document, hunting for that one section you needed. Frustrating, right?

With Tallyfy's automatic table of contents:
- Readers grasp your document structure in seconds
- One click takes them anywhere - no scrolling marathons
- You're forced to organize content logically (trust me, this is good)
- 50-page documents become as easy to navigate as 5-page ones
- Everyone knows exactly what they're getting before they dive in
