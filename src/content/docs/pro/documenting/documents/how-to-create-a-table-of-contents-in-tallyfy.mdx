## Creating a table of contents

Tallyfy builds a table of contents automatically using your headings - no manual work required. This makes your [documents](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) and [procedure templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) much easier to navigate.

### What you need
- A document or procedure template opened for editing.
- Some text that you want to organize using headings.

### How Tallyfy's table of contents is different from Word's

Unlike Microsoft Word where you manually insert and update tables of contents, Tallyfy handles everything automatically:

- **Instant creation**: Add a heading and it appears in the navigation instantly.
- **Live updates**: Change a heading and the table of contents updates immediately.
- **Screen-optimized**: Built for online reading and clicking, not printing.
- **Zero maintenance**: Never worry about outdated navigation again.

### Creating a table of contents in Documents

Watch your table of contents build itself as you create headings:

<Steps>
1. Highlight the text you want to make a main section heading.
2. Click the formatting menu in the toolbar (it might look like **Normal text** or show heading styles).
3. Choose **H1** to make it a main heading.

4. To make sub-headings, highlight the text for the subsection.
5. Choose **H2** (for a sub-heading under H1) or **H3** (for a sub-heading under H2) from the menu.

</Steps>

Your headings will automatically show up in the table of contents panel, creating links to those sections.

### Tips for using headings well

To make your table of contents clear and organized:
- Use **H1** only for the main sections of your document.
- Use **H2** for sections inside an H1 section.
- Use **H3** for sections inside an H2 section, if needed.
- Don't skip heading levels (like going from H1 straight to H3).
- Keep your heading titles short and clear.

### Table of contents in Procedure templates

Procedure templates get automatic navigation too - here's how to access it:

<Steps>
1. Open the procedure template you want to view.
2. Click **Preview** to see how it looks to users.
3. Find and click the table of contents icon (usually looks like lines or a list) in the top right corner.

4. Click on any heading in the table of contents to jump straight to that section.

### Why automatic table of contents matter
- Users see the document structure at a glance.
- One-click navigation to any section saves time.
- Forces you to organize content logically.
- Long documents become instantly scannable.
- Readers know exactly what they're getting into.
