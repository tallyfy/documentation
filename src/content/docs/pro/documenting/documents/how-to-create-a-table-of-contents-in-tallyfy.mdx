## Creating a table of contents

Tallyfy automatically generates a table of contents based on heading structure, providing easy navigation through [documents](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) and [procedure templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).

### Requirements
- A document or procedure template in edit mode
- Content to organize with headings

### Tallyfy vs Word: Table of contents approach

Unlike Microsoft Word where you need to manually insert and update a table of contents, Tallyfy builds it automatically from your semantic headings:

- **Automatic generation**: As you create headings, they instantly appear in the navigation panel
- **Always updated**: Changes to headings are immediately reflected in the table of contents
- **Purpose-built for digital**: Designed for screen reading and navigation rather than print layouts
- **No manual refreshing**: Never worry about outdated tables of contents as in Word documents

### Creating a table of contents in Documents

The table of contents is created automatically as you add headings to your document:

<Steps>
1. Select the text you want to designate as a main section
2. Click the formatting dropdown in the toolbar
3. Select **H1** to create a top-level heading

4. For subsections, select the appropriate text
5. Choose **H2** or **H3** from the formatting dropdown

</Steps>

The table of contents will automatically populate with your headings in the navigation panel.

### Heading hierarchy best practices

For optimal table of contents organization:
- Use **H1** for main sections only
- Use **H2** for subsections within H1 sections
- Use **H3** for further subdivision when needed
- Maintain a logical hierarchy without skipping levels
- Keep heading text concise and descriptive

### Table of contents in Procedure templates

Procedure templates also contain a table of contents for easier navigation:

<Steps>
1. Open a procedure template
2. Click **Preview** to view the template as it will appear to users
3. Navigate to the table of contents by clicking the TOC icon in the upper right

4. Use the table of contents to jump to specific sections

- Enables quick navigation to specific sections
- Encourages logical organization of content
- Makes lengthy documents more accessible
- Helps users understand the document flow at a glance
