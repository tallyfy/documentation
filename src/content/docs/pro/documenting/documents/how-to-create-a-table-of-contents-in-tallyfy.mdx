## How automatic table of contents work in Tallyfy

Tallyfy builds a table of contents from your headings automatically. Add headings, and the navigation appears - no manual linking or page numbers. Your [documents](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) and [procedure templates[^1]](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) become instantly navigable.

### What you need
- A document or procedure template open for editing
- Text you want to organize with headings

### How Tallyfy's table of contents differs from Word

Word's table of contents needs manual refreshing, page numbers break, and formatting fights you. Tallyfy works differently:

- **Instant creation** - add a heading and it appears in navigation immediately
- **Live updates** - change a heading and the table of contents updates in real-time
- **Screen-optimized[^2]** - built for clicking and navigating, not printing
- **Zero maintenance** - you'll never manually update navigation again

### Creating a table of contents in documents

<Steps>
1. Highlight the text you want as a main section heading.
2. Click the formatting menu in your toolbar (it may show **Normal text** or heading styles).
3. Choose **H1** to make it a main heading.

4. For sub-headings, highlight text in that subsection.
5. Pick **H2** (sits under H1) or **H3** (sits under H2) from the menu.

</Steps>

Your headings instantly appear in the table of contents panel as clickable links.

### Tips for using headings well

- **H1** is for main sections only - think chapter titles
- **H2** goes inside H1 sections - your subchapters
- **H3** goes inside H2 sections (if you really need that level)
- Don't skip levels - no jumping from H1 to H3
- Keep headings short. Really short.

### Table of contents in procedure templates

Procedure templates work a bit differently. You still get automatic navigation, but you access it through preview mode:

<Steps>
1. Open your procedure template.
2. Click **Preview** to see the user view.
3. Look for the table of contents icon in the top right (looks like stacked lines).

4. Click any heading to jump directly to that section.

### Why automatic table of contents matter

An automatic table of contents gives readers:
- A clear view of your document's structure in seconds
- One-click jumps to any section - no scrolling marathons
- A reason to organize content logically (this makes your docs better, too)
- Equal ease of navigation whether a document is 5 or 50 pages
