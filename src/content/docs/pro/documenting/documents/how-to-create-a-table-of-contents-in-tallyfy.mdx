## Creating a table of contents

Tallyfy automatically makes a table of contents for you based on the headings you use. This helps people navigate through your [documents](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) and [procedure templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).

### What you need
- A document or procedure template opened for editing.
- Some text that you want to organize using headings.

### How Tallyfy's table of contents is different from Word's

In Microsoft Word, you usually have to insert and update a table of contents manually. Tallyfy does it automatically using your headings:

- **Made automatically**: When you make a heading, it shows up in the navigation list right away.
- **Always up-to-date**: If you change a heading, the table of contents updates instantly.
- **Built for screens**: It's designed for easy clicking and reading online, not for printing.
- **No manual updates**: You don't have to worry about the table of contents being old, unlike in Word.

### Creating a table of contents in Documents

The table of contents appears automatically as you add headings:

<Steps>
1. Highlight the text you want to make a main section heading.
2. Click the formatting menu in the toolbar (it might look like **Normal text** or show heading styles).
3. Choose **H1** to make it a main heading.

4. To make sub-headings, highlight the text for the subsection.
5. Choose **H2** (for a sub-heading under H1) or **H3** (for a sub-heading under H2) from the menu.

</Steps>

Your headings will automatically show up in the table of contents panel, creating links to those sections.

### Tips for using headings well

To make your table of contents clear and organized:
- Use **H1** only for the main sections of your document.
- Use **H2** for sections inside an H1 section.
- Use **H3** for sections inside an H2 section, if needed.
- Don't skip heading levels (like going from H1 straight to H3).
- Keep your heading titles short and clear.

### Table of contents in Procedure templates

Procedure templates also have an automatic table of contents to help you find things:

<Steps>
1. Open the procedure template you want to view.
2. Click **Preview** to see how it looks to users.
3. Find and click the table of contents icon (usually looks like lines or a list) in the top right corner.

4. Click on any heading in the table of contents to jump straight to that section.

### Benefits of using a table of contents
- Shows a clear outline of the document.
- Lets users quickly jump to the section they need.
- Helps you organize your content logically.
- Makes long documents easier to read and use.
- Helps users quickly understand what the document covers.
