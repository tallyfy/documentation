## How to auto-generate documents from Tallyfy form data

Create contracts, reports, or signature requests directly from Tallyfy form responses - it takes about 15 minutes to set up.

### What you'll need
- A Tallyfy [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) with [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) that collect your data
- A [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) account (see our middleware guide for platform comparisons)
- A document creation service (like WebMerge/Formstack Documents, DocuSign, or HelloSign)

### How it works
When someone completes a task in Tallyfy, a webhook fires with all form field data[^2]. [Middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) catches that webhook and sends the data to your document service - which creates PDFs, Word files, or triggers signature requests. No manual copying.

### Step 1 - Set up your Tallyfy template
<Steps>
1. Create or edit a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in Tallyfy.
2. Add the [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) you need - every piece of information your document requires.
3. Mark essential fields as required so people can't skip them.
4. Pick which step should trigger document creation. When someone completes this step, your document gets generated.
</Steps>

### Step 2 - Configure your middleware connection
<Steps>
1. Open your middleware tool and create a new workflow (Zapier calls these "Zaps", Power Automate calls them "Flows").
2. Select Tallyfy as your trigger app.
3. Choose "New Task Completed" as your trigger event (the exact name varies by middleware platform).
4. Configure it to watch for your specific step from Step 1.
</Steps>

### Step 3 - Connect your document service
<Steps>
1. Add an action step using your document service (WebMerge, DocuSign, HelloSign, etc.).
2. Select your document template - this could be a contract, NDA, or any document you've set up.
3. Map Tallyfy's [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to your document's placeholders. The webhook payload includes each field's alias, label, and value.
4. Choose your output format (PDF works for most cases) or set up signature request details.
</Steps>

### Step 4 - Deliver documents and track signatures
<Steps>
1. Add a delivery step - email it, save to Google Drive or Dropbox, or whatever you need.
2. **(Optional for signatures)**: Set up a second workflow that watches for completed signatures. When someone signs, this workflow finds the original Tallyfy task (you'll need to store the Task ID)[^1] and marks it complete.
3. Test everything. Launch a test process and confirm your documents generate correctly before going live.
</Steps>

[^1]: Task IDs use a non-incrementing string format unique to each task instance
[^2]: Data flows via webhook events triggered on task completion, processed by middleware
