## Generate documents via form fields using other document generation systems

This article will show you how to use middleware to generate documents from form fields in Tallyfy.

To start, you can connect a step in a Tallyfy template to Zapier or other middleware like Microsoft Power Automate. This will allow you to send form contents from previous steps to WebMerge.

Once the form contents are sent to WebMerge, you can then have the document automatically sent to a designated email address.
