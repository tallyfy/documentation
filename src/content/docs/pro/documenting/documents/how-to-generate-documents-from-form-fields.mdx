## Sending Tallyfy form data to document creation systems

### What you need
- A Tallyfy [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) that includes [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to collect information.
- An account with a [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) tool (like Zapier or Microsoft Power Automate).
- An account with a service that creates documents automatically (like WebMerge/Formstack Documents, DocuSign, HelloSign, or other e-signature platforms).

### Overview
You can automatically create documents (PDFs, Word files) or send signature requests using data from Tallyfy [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/). The process works by connecting Tallyfy to document services through [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) tools.

### Step 1: Prepare your Tallyfy Template
<Steps>
1. Create or edit a Tallyfy [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).
2. Add all the [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) needed to gather the information for your final document.
3. Configure field requirements - mark essential fields as required so they can't be skipped.
4. Choose a step in your template. When this step is completed, the document creation process should start automatically.
</Steps>

### Step 2: Set up the connection in your middleware tool
<Steps>
1. Create a new workflow in your middleware tool (a "Zap" in Zapier or "Flow" in Power Automate).
2. Choose Tallyfy as the starting application (the trigger).
3. Select the event that should start the workflow (e.g., "New Task Completed" or similar, depending on the middleware).
4. Set up the trigger to watch for when the specific step you chose in Step 1 is completed in Tallyfy.
</Steps>

### Step 3: Connect to the document creation or e-signature service
<Steps>
1. Add an action step in your middleware workflow using your document service (WebMerge, DocuSign, HelloSign, etc.).
2. Choose the specific document template (e.g., your contract template) or signature request template that you want to populate.
3. Match the Tallyfy [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) (from the trigger step) to the correct blanks or signer roles in your document/signature template.
4. Choose what kind of file you want to create (PDF, Word document, etc.) or configure the signature request details.
</Steps>

### Step 4: Set up how to deliver the document or track signatures
<Steps>
1. Add a final step in your middleware workflow to send the newly created document somewhere (e.g., send it in an email, save it to Google Drive or Dropbox) or to handle the signature request.
2. **(Optional for signatures)**: Want Tallyfy to update when documents get signed? Create a second workflow that triggers when the signature platform reports completion. This workflow finds the original Tallyfy task (store the Task ID during setup) and marks it complete automatically.
3. Test the complete workflow end-to-end - launch a process and verify documents get created properly.
</Steps>
