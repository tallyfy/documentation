## Sending Tallyfy form data to document creation systems

### What you need
- A Tallyfy [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) that includes [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to collect information.
- An account with a [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) tool (like Zapier or Microsoft Power Automate).
- An account with a service that creates documents automatically (like WebMerge/Formstack Documents, DocuSign, HelloSign, or other e-signature platforms).

### Overview
You can automatically create documents (like PDFs or Word files) or initiate signature requests using information collected in Tallyfy [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/). You do this by connecting Tallyfy to a document creation or e-signature service using a [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) tool.

### Step 1: Prepare your Tallyfy Template
<Steps>
1. Create or edit a Tallyfy [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).
2. Add all the [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) needed to gather the information for your final document.
3. Make sure important fields are set up correctly (e.g., required fields must be filled in).
4. Choose a step in your template. When this step is completed, the document creation process should start automatically.
</Steps>

### Step 2: Set up the connection in your middleware tool
<Steps>
1. Create a new workflow in your middleware tool (e.g., a Zap in Zapier or a Flow in Power Automate).
2. Choose Tallyfy as the starting application (the trigger).
3. Select the event that should start the workflow (e.g., "New Task Completed" or similar, depending on the middleware).
4. Set up the trigger to watch for when the specific step you chose in Step 1 is completed in Tallyfy.
</Steps>

### Step 3: Connect to the document creation or e-signature service
<Steps>
1. In your middleware workflow, add an action step using your chosen document creation or e-signature service (e.g., WebMerge/Formstack Documents, DocuSign, HelloSign).
2. Choose the specific document template (e.g., your contract template) or signature request template that you want to populate.
3. Match the Tallyfy [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) (from the trigger step) to the correct blanks or signer roles in your document/signature template.
4. Choose what kind of file you want to create (PDF, Word document, etc.) or configure the signature request details.
</Steps>

### Step 4: Set up how to deliver the document or track signatures
<Steps>
1. Add a final step in your middleware workflow to send the newly created document somewhere (e.g., send it in an email, save it to Google Drive or Dropbox) or to handle the signature request.
2. **(Optional - For Signatures)**: To automatically update Tallyfy when a document is signed, you may need a separate middleware workflow. This workflow would be triggered by the e-signature platform when the document is completed. It would then need to find the original Tallyfy task (you might need to store the Task ID in the middleware or the e-signature request) and use a Tallyfy action (like "Complete Task") to update its status.
3. Test the entire setup from start to finish to make sure it works correctly.
</Steps>
