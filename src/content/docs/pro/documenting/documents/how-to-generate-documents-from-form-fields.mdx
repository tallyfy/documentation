## Generating documents from form field data

### Requirements
- A Tallyfy [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) with [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/)
- Access to [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) like Zapier or Microsoft Power Automate
- Account with a document generation service (e.g., WebMerge/Formstack Documents)

### Overview
You can automate document creation by sending [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) data collected in Tallyfy to third-party document generation systems through middleware [integrations](/products/pro/integrations/).

### Step 1: Prepare your Tallyfy Template
<Steps>
1. Create a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) with [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to collect the necessary data
2. Ensure all required fields have appropriate validation
3. Add a step that will trigger the integration
</Steps>

### Step 2: Set up the middleware connection
<Steps>
1. Create a new Zap in Zapier or Flow in Microsoft Power Automate
2. Select Tallyfy as the trigger application
3. Choose the appropriate trigger event (e.g., "New Task Completed")
4. Configure the trigger to monitor the specific step in your template
</Steps>

### Step 3: Connect to document generation
<Steps>
1. Add WebMerge/Formstack Documents (or similar service) as the action step
2. Select the [document template](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) you want to populate
3. Map the Tallyfy [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to the corresponding fields in your document template
4. Configure output options (PDF, Word, etc.)
</Steps>

### Step 4: Set up delivery
<Steps>
1. Add a final action to deliver the document (email, storage service, etc.)
2. Test the entire workflow to verify proper functionality
</Steps>
