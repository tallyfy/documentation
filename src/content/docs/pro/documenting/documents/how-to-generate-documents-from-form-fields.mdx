## How to automatically generate documents from Tallyfy form data

You can automatically create contracts, reports, or signature requests directly from Tallyfy form responses - it takes about 15 minutes to set up. Here's how.

### What you'll need
- A Tallyfy [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) with [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) that collect your data
- A [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) account (Zapier or Microsoft Power Automate work great)
- A document creation service (like WebMerge/Formstack Documents, DocuSign, HelloSign - pick your favorite)

### The basic idea
When someone completes a form in Tallyfy, that data automatically flows to your document service to create PDFs, Word files, or trigger signature requests. No manual copying[^2]. The magic happens through [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) that connects everything together.

### Step 1: Set up your Tallyfy template
<Steps>
1. Create or edit a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in Tallyfy.
2. Add the [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) you need - think about every piece of information your document requires.
3. Mark essential fields as required (this prevents people from skipping important stuff).
4. Pick which step should trigger document creation. When someone completes this step, your document gets generated automatically.
</Steps>

### Step 2: Configure your middleware connection
<Steps>
1. Open your middleware tool and create a new workflow (Zapier calls these "Zaps", Power Automate calls them "Flows").
2. Select Tallyfy as your trigger app - this is what starts everything.
3. Choose "New Task Completed" as your trigger event (the exact name varies by middleware).
4. Configure it to watch for your specific step from Step 1. That's your automation trigger.
</Steps>

### Step 3: Connect your document service
<Steps>
1. Add an action step using your document service (WebMerge, DocuSign, HelloSign - whatever you're using).
2. Select your document template. This might be your contract template, NDA, or any other document you've set up.
3. Here's the fun part - map Tallyfy's [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to your document's placeholders. Match each field to where it belongs in your document.
4. Choose your output format (PDF works for most cases) or set up signature request details if you're collecting signatures.
</Steps>

### Step 4: Deliver documents and track signatures
<Steps>
1. Add one more step to handle your finished document. Email it, save to Google Drive or Dropbox - your choice.
2. **(Optional for signatures)**: Want the full circle? Set up a second workflow that watches for completed signatures. When someone signs, this workflow finds the original Tallyfy task (you'll need to store the Task ID)[^1] and marks it complete. Pretty slick.
3. Test everything. Launch a test process and make sure your documents generate correctly. Trust me - test it now, not when the CEO's waiting for that contract.
</Steps>

[^1]: Task IDs use a 32-character hash format unique to each task instance in the system
[^2]: Data flows via webhook events triggered on task completion, processed by middleware
