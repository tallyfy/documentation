## Sending Tallyfy form data to document creation tools

### What you need
- A Tallyfy [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) that includes [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to collect information.
- An account with a [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) tool (like Zapier or Microsoft Power Automate).
- An account with a service that creates documents automatically (like WebMerge/Formstack Documents).

### Overview
You can automatically create documents (like PDFs or Word files) using information collected in Tallyfy [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/). You do this by connecting Tallyfy to a document creation service using a [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) tool.

### Step 1: Prepare your Tallyfy Template
<Steps>
1. Create or edit a Tallyfy [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).
2. Add all the [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) needed to gather the information for your final document.
3. Make sure important fields are set up correctly (e.g., required fields must be filled in).
4. Choose a step in your template. When this step is completed, the document creation process should start automatically.
</Steps>

### Step 2: Set up the connection in your middleware tool
<Steps>
1. Create a new workflow in your middleware tool (e.g., a Zap in Zapier or a Flow in Power Automate).
2. Choose Tallyfy as the starting application (the trigger).
3. Select the event that should start the workflow (e.g., "New Task Completed" or similar, depending on the middleware).
4. Set up the trigger to watch for when the specific step you chose in Step 1 is completed in Tallyfy.
</Steps>

### Step 3: Connect to the document creation service
<Steps>
1. In your middleware workflow, add an action step using your document creation service (e.g., WebMerge/Formstack Documents).
2. Choose the specific document template (e.g., your contract template) that you want to fill with Tallyfy data.
3. Match the Tallyfy [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) (from the trigger step) to the correct blanks in your document template in the document creation service.
4. Choose what kind of file you want to create (PDF, Word document, etc.).
</Steps>

### Step 4: Set up how to deliver the document
<Steps>
1. Add a final step in your middleware workflow to send the newly created document somewhere (e.g., send it in an email, save it to Google Drive or Dropbox).
2. Test the entire setup from start to finish to make sure it works correctly.
</Steps>
