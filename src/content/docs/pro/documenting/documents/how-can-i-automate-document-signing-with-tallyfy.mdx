## How to automate document signing using middleware

Connect Tallyfy to e-signature services like DocuSign or HelloSign through [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) tools. When someone completes a workflow step, documents automatically go out for signing. No manual work. Most teams save 15-20 minutes per document[^1].

### What you'll need
- A Tallyfy account with [webhook](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) access
- A [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) account (Zapier, Power Automate, or Make.com)
- An e-signature service account (DocuSign or HelloSign)
- A document template ready in your signature service

:::note[Setting up middleware]
If you haven't used middleware before, check the [middleware integration guide](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) for setup instructions and platform comparisons.
:::

### How it works
<Steps>
1. Create a workflow in your middleware tool that receives data from Tallyfy.
2. Set up a Tallyfy [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) with [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to collect what your document needs - name, email, contract terms, etc.
3. Add a [webhook](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) to the Tallyfy step that should trigger signing.
4. Connect your e-signature service in the middleware tool.
5. Test everything and activate the [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/).
</Steps>

### Document signing automation flow

# Document Signing Automation Flow
direction: down

# People
User: "User" {
  shape: person
  style.fill: "#f2faf4"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

Signer: "Signer" {
  shape: person
  style.fill: "#f2faf4"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

# Systems
Tallyfy: "Tallyfy" {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#e1f7e6"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.stroke-width: 2
}

Webhook: "Webhook" {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#e1f7e6"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

Middleware: "Middleware" {
  shape: hexagon
  style.fill: "#f2faf4"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

DocuSign: "DocuSign" {
  shape: cloud
  style.fill: "#f2faf4"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

# Process Flow
User -> Tallyfy: "1. Complete task" {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

Tallyfy -> Webhook: "2. Trigger webhook" {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.animated: true
}

Webhook -> Middleware: "3. Send data" {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.animated: true
}

Middleware -> DocuSign: "4. Create envelope" {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

DocuSign -> Signer: "5. Email to sign" {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

Signer -> DocuSign: "6. Sign document" {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

DocuSign -> Middleware: "7. Signed webhook" {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.stroke-dash: 3
}

Middleware -> Tallyfy: "8. Update process" {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.stroke-dash: 3
}

Tallyfy -> User: "9. Notify complete" {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}
```

**Key points:**
- **Steps 2-3**: The webhook fires[^2] when someone completes a Tallyfy step - no manual triggers needed
- **Step 4**: Middleware handles field mapping - set it up once and it works every time
- **Steps 7-8**: The optional return path means Tallyfy knows when documents get signed without you checking

### Step 1: Create a webhook listener in your middleware

<Steps>
1. Create a new workflow in your middleware tool (called a "Zap" in Zapier, "Flow" in Power Automate, or "Scenario" in Make.com).
2. Choose "Webhooks" as the starting trigger.
3. Select "Catch Hook" or "When a HTTP request is received" as the trigger event.
4. Copy the unique URL your middleware gives you - Tallyfy sends data to this address.

</Steps>

### Step 2: Set up your Tallyfy process

<Steps>
1. Create or edit a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in Tallyfy.
2. Add [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to collect what your document needs - client name, email, contract details, etc.
3. Pick the step where document signing should trigger. When someone completes this step, the signature request goes out automatically.
4. Add the webhook URL from Step 1 to this step:
   - Click the settings icon for the step.
   - Go to the **[Outbound Webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/)** section.
   - Paste the URL you copied from your middleware tool.
   - Choose which form field data to send.

</Steps>

### Step 3: Connect your e-signature service in the middleware

#### For HelloSign
<Steps>
1. Prepare your document template in HelloSign with all signature fields and data spots marked.
   ![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/auto-sign-zapier-5.png)
2. In your middleware workflow, add a HelloSign action step after the webhook trigger.
3. Choose "Send Signature Request From Template".
4. Select your HelloSign template.
5. Map the Tallyfy fields to HelloSign fields - for example, Tallyfy's 'Client Name' goes to HelloSign's 'Signer Name'.

</Steps>

#### For DocuSign
<Steps>
1. Prepare your document template in DocuSign with signature and data fields marked.
   ![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/auto-sign-zapier-7.png)
2. In your middleware workflow, add a DocuSign action step after the webhook trigger.
3. Choose "Create Signature Request".
4. Select your DocuSign template.
5. Map each Tallyfy field to the corresponding DocuSign field.
   ![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/auto-sign-zapier-8.png)
</Steps>

### Step 4: Test and activate
<Steps>
1. Test your middleware workflow to confirm everything connects.
2. [Launch](/products/pro/launching/) a Tallyfy [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) with test data - use your own email to see it work.
3. Complete the step that has the [webhook](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) attached.
4. Check your email for the signature request.
5. If it works, activate your middleware workflow. Look for "Publish", "Turn On", or "Activate" depending on your platform.
</Steps>

### Tracking when the document is signed

You can set up a return path so Tallyfy knows when documents get signed:

<Steps>
1. Create a second workflow in your middleware tool that triggers when your e-signature service reports "document signed."
2. Use the Tallyfy [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) to find the right [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) and mark it complete.
3. You'll need three IDs from Tallyfy:
   - Your [Organization ID](/products/pro/miscellaneous/how-to-find-your-tallyfy-ids/) (found in Tallyfy settings).
   - The Process ID for the launched process instance.
   - The Task ID for the task to mark complete.
</Steps>

The end result:
1. Someone completes a Tallyfy step - document goes out for signing.
2. Recipient signs the document.
3. Tallyfy updates to show the signing task is done.
