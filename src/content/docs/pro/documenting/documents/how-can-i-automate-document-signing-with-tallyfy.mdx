## Automating document signatures with middleware

Tallyfy can integrate with electronic signature services through middleware platforms to automate the document signing process at specific points in your workflow.

### Prerequisites
- A Tallyfy account with webhook capabilities
- Access to a middleware system (Zapier, Microsoft Power Automate, Make.com, etc.)
- Account with an eSignature service (DocuSign, HelloSign, etc.)
- Prepared template in your eSignature service

:::note[Setting up middleware]
If you're new to middleware systems, see our [guide on connecting Tallyfy to Zapier](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/zapier/how-to-connect-your-tallyfy-account-to-zapier/) for an example setup.
:::

### Implementation overview
1. Create a middleware workflow to receive data from Tallyfy
2. Set up a Tallyfy process with form fields to collect necessary information
3. Configure an outbound webhook in Tallyfy to send data to the middleware
4. Connect your eSignature service through the middleware
5. Test and activate the automation

### Step 1: Create a webhook in your middleware

Using Zapier as an example:
1. Create a new Zap
2. Select "Webhooks by Zapier" as the trigger app
3. Choose "Catch Hook" as the trigger event
4. Save the generated webhook URL

### Step 2: Set up your Tallyfy process

1. Create a procedure template in Tallyfy
2. Add form fields to collect all information needed for the signature document:
   - Client name
   - Email address
   - Other relevant data
3. Create a step that will trigger the signature request when completed
4. Add the webhook URL to this step:
   - Click the step settings
   - Select the **Webhooks** tab
   - Paste the URL from your middleware
   - Configure which data to send

### Step 3: Configure your eSignature integration

#### For HelloSign
1. Prepare your template in HelloSign with all required fields
   ![HelloSign template setup](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/auto-sign-zapier-5.png)
2. In your middleware, add a HelloSign action after the webhook trigger
3. Choose "Send Signature Request From Template"
4. Select your HelloSign template
5. Map the data from Tallyfy to the appropriate fields in HelloSign

#### For DocuSign
1. Prepare your template in DocuSign with all required fields
   ![DocuSign template setup](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/auto-sign-zapier-7.png)
2. In your middleware, add a DocuSign action after the webhook trigger
3. Choose "Create Signature Request"
4. Select your DocuSign template
5. Map the data from Tallyfy to the appropriate fields in DocuSign
   ![Mapping data to DocuSign](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/auto-sign-zapier-8.png)

### Step 4: Testing and activating the integration
1. Test your middleware configuration
2. Launch your Tallyfy process with test data
3. Complete the step with the webhook
4. Verify that the signature request is sent properly
5. Activate your middleware workflow

### Tracking signature completion

To automatically update Tallyfy when a document is signed:

1. Create a second middleware workflow that triggers when a document is signed
2. Configure it to use the Tallyfy API to mark the appropriate task as complete
3. You'll need:
   - Organization ID (from Tallyfy settings)
   - Process ID (from the active process)
   - Task ID (for the task to be completed)

This creates a complete automation cycle where:
1. Tallyfy triggers a signature request when a step is completed
2. The signer receives and signs the document
3. Tallyfy is automatically updated when the document is signed
