## How to automate document signing using helper tools (middleware)

You can connect Tallyfy to online signature services (like DocuSign or HelloSign) using helper tools called [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/). This lets you automatically send documents for signing when a specific step in your Tallyfy workflow is finished.

### What you need
- A Tallyfy account that allows [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) (a way for Tallyfy to send information out).
- An account with a [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) tool (like Zapier, Microsoft Power Automate, Make.com).
- An account with an e-signature service (like DocuSign, HelloSign).
- A ready-to-use document [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) set up in your e-signature service.

:::note[Setting up middleware]
If you haven't used middleware before, check our [guide on connecting Tallyfy to Zapier](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/zapier/how-to-connect-your-tallyfy-account-to-zapier/) for an example.
:::

### How it works (overview)
<Steps>
1. Create a workflow in your middleware tool that can receive information from Tallyfy.
2. Set up a Tallyfy [Process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) with [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to collect the information needed for the document (like name, email).
3. Set up a [webhook](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) in a specific Tallyfy step to send the collected information to your middleware tool.
4. Connect your e-signature service to your middleware tool.
5. Test the connection and turn on the [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/).
</Steps>

### Step 1: Create a listening point (webhook) in your middleware

Here's how using Zapier as an example:
<Steps>
1. Start creating a new "Zap" (Zapier workflow).
2. Choose "Webhooks by Zapier" as the starting app.
3. Select "Catch Hook" as the event that starts the Zap.
4. Zapier will give you a unique web address (URL). Copy and save this URL â€“ it's where Tallyfy will send information.

</Steps>

### Step 2: Set up your Tallyfy Process

<Steps>
1. Create or edit a [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in Tallyfy.
2. Add [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to collect all the details needed for the document you want signed (e.g., client name, email address, contract details).
3. Choose a step in your process. When this step is completed, the document signing request should be sent automatically.
4. Add the webhook URL (the web address from Step 1) to this trigger step:
   - Click the settings icon for that step.
   - Go to the **[Webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/)** tab.
   - Paste the URL you copied from your middleware tool.
   - Choose which form field data Tallyfy should send to the webhook URL.

</Steps>

### Step 3: Connect your e-signature service in the middleware

This part happens in your middleware tool (like Zapier).

#### For HelloSign
<Steps>
1. Make sure your document template is ready in HelloSign with all the places for information and signatures defined.
   ![HelloSign template setup](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/auto-sign-zapier-5.png)
2. In your middleware workflow (Zap), add a HelloSign action step right after the webhook trigger.
3. Choose the action "Send Signature Request From Template".
4. Select the HelloSign template you prepared.
5. Match the information coming from Tallyfy (via the webhook) to the correct fields in your HelloSign template (e.g., Tallyfy's 'Client Name' field goes to HelloSign's 'Signer Name' field).
   ![Mapping data to HelloSign](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/auto-sign-zapier-6.png)
</Steps>

#### For DocuSign
<Steps>
1. Make sure your document template is ready in DocuSign with all the places for information and signatures defined.
   ![DocuSign template setup](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/auto-sign-zapier-7.png)
2. In your middleware workflow (Zap), add a DocuSign action step right after the webhook trigger.
3. Choose the action "Create Signature Request".
4. Select the DocuSign template you prepared.
5. Match the information coming from Tallyfy (via the webhook) to the correct fields in your DocuSign template.

</Steps>

### Step 4: Testing and turning on the connection
<Steps>
1. Test your middleware workflow setup to make sure it connects correctly.
2. [Launch](/products/pro/launching/) your Tallyfy [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) using some test information.
3. Complete the Tallyfy step that has the [webhook](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) attached.
4. Check if the signature request email was sent correctly from your e-signature service.
5. If everything works, turn on your middleware workflow (activate the Zap).
</Steps>

### Tracking when the document is signed

Want Tallyfy to know when the document is actually signed? You can set up another automation:

<Steps>
1. Create a second workflow in your middleware tool. This one should start when your e-signature service reports that a document has been signed.
2. Set up this workflow to use the Tallyfy [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) (a way for other programs to talk to Tallyfy) to find the right Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) and mark it as complete.
3. To do this, you'll need specific IDs from Tallyfy:
   - Your unique [Organization ID](/products/pro/miscellaneous/how-to-find-your-tallyfy-ids/) (find this in Tallyfy settings).
   - The Process ID for the specific process instance that was launched.
   - The Task ID for the specific task you want to mark as complete.
</Steps>

Setting this up creates a full circle:
1. Completing a Tallyfy step automatically sends a document for signing.
2. The person signs the document.
3. Tallyfy automatically gets updated to show the signing task is done.
