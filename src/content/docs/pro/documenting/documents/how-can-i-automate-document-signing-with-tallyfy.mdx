## How to automate document signing using middleware

Tallyfy can integrate with electronic signature services through [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) platforms to automate the document signing process at specific points in your workflow.

### Requirements
- A Tallyfy account with [webhook](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) capabilities
- Access to a [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) system (Zapier, Microsoft Power Automate, Make.com, etc.)
- Account with an eSignature service (DocuSign, HelloSign, etc.)
- Prepared [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in your eSignature service

:::note[Setting up middleware]
If you're new to middleware systems, see our [guide on connecting Tallyfy to Zapier](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/zapier/how-to-connect-your-tallyfy-account-to-zapier/) for an example setup.
:::

### Implementation overview
1. Create a middleware workflow to receive data from Tallyfy
2. Set up a Tallyfy [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) with [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to collect necessary information
3. Configure an outbound [webhook](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) in Tallyfy to send data to the middleware
4. Connect your eSignature service through the middleware
5. Test and activate the [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/)

### Step 1: Create a webhook in your middleware

Using Zapier as an example:
1. Create a new Zap
2. Select "Webhooks by Zapier" as the trigger app
3. Choose "Catch Hook" as the trigger event
4. Save the generated webhook URL
   ![Creating a Zapier webhook](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/auto-sign-zapier-1.png)

### Step 2: Set up your Tallyfy process

1. Create a [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in Tallyfy
2. Add [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to collect all information needed for the signature document:
   - Client name
   - Email address
   - Other relevant data
3. Create a step that will trigger the signature request when completed
4. Add the webhook URL to this step:
   - Click the step settings
   - Select the **[Webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/)** tab
   - Paste the URL from your middleware
   - Configure which data to send

### Step 3: Configure your eSignature integration

#### For HelloSign
1. Prepare your template in HelloSign with all required fields
   ![HelloSign template setup](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/auto-sign-zapier-5.png)
2. In your middleware, add a HelloSign action after the webhook trigger
3. Choose "Send Signature Request From Template"
4. Select your HelloSign template
5. Map the data from Tallyfy to the appropriate fields in HelloSign
   ![Mapping data to HelloSign](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/auto-sign-zapier-6.png)

#### For DocuSign
1. Prepare your template in DocuSign with all required fields
   ![DocuSign template setup](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/auto-sign-zapier-7.png)
2. In your middleware, add a DocuSign action after the webhook trigger
3. Choose "Create Signature Request"
4. Select your DocuSign template
5. Map the data from Tallyfy to the appropriate fields in DocuSign
   ![Mapping data to DocuSign](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/auto-sign-zapier-8.png)

### Step 4: Testing and activating the integration
1. Test your middleware configuration
2. [Launch](/products/pro/launching/) your Tallyfy [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) with test data
3. Complete the step with the [webhook](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/)
4. Verify that the signature request is sent properly
5. Activate your middleware workflow

### Tracking signature completion

To automatically update Tallyfy when a document is signed:

1. Create a second middleware workflow that triggers when a document is signed
2. Configure it to use the Tallyfy [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) to mark the appropriate [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) as complete
3. You'll need:
   - [Organization ID](/products/pro/miscellaneous/how-to-find-your-tallyfy-ids/) (from Tallyfy settings)
   - Process ID (from the active process)
   - Task ID (for the task to be completed)

This creates a complete [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) cycle where:
1. Tallyfy triggers a signature request when a step is completed
2. The signer receives and signs the document
3. Tallyfy is automatically updated when the document is signed
