## Launching and using a Document Template

To launch a document template in Tallyfy, just click **Launch Document** on any template card in your library - this creates a new document where you fill in the editable fields through a simple form. It's that straightforward.

Once you've created a [Document Template](/products/pro/documenting/documents/), you can launch as many instances as you need. Each launched document combines your template's fixed content with the specific data you enter.

### How to launch

<Steps>
1.  Navigate to your **Library**
2.  Find the Document Template you want to use
3.  Click **Launch Document** on the template card
    *Alternatively, you can click **Launch Document** from within the Document Template editor*

4.  A **kick-off form** will appear - this contains all the editable [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) you added to your template (think of it like filling out a smart form)

5.  Fill in the required information in the kick-off form fields
6.  Once you've completed all required fields, click the **Launch Document** button at the bottom of the form

</Steps>

Done. Tallyfy creates your launched document instance, automatically populating it with the information you just entered.

### Viewing and editing the launched document

Here's what happens after you launch:

<Steps>
1.  The launched document opens immediately - you'll see your fixed template content merged with the data you entered
2.  To **preview** or **download** the completed document, click the **Preview** button (you'll see either a printer or eye icon, depending on where you are)

3.  Need to change something? Click the **Edit** button (pencil icon) next to the fields section - this reopens the form so you can update any values
</Steps>
