## How to create document instances from templates

Click **Launch Document** on any template card in your **Library** to create a new document instance. You'll fill in editable fields through a kick-off form, and Tallyfy merges your data with the template's fixed content.

You can launch as many instances as you need from a single [Document Template](/products/pro/documenting/documents/). Each one is independent.

### How to launch

<Steps>
1.  Go to your **Library**
2.  Find the Document Template you want
3.  Click **Launch Document** on the template card
    *You can also click **Launch Document** from within the Document Template editor*

4.  A **kick-off form[^1]** appears - it contains all the editable [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) from your template

5.  Fill in the required fields
6.  Click **Launch Document** at the bottom of the form

</Steps>

That's it. Tallyfy creates your document instance, populated with the data you entered.

### Viewing and editing the launched document

<Steps>
1.  The launched document opens right away - your fixed template content is merged with the data you entered
2.  Click **Preview** (glasses icon) to read the document, or **Print** (printer icon) to print or download it

3.  Need to change something? Click the **Edit** button (pen icon) to reopen the form and update field values
</Steps>
