## Launching and using a Document Template

Once you have created a [Document Template](/products/pro/documenting/documents/), you can launch instances of it. Launching creates a specific version of the document where users fill in the predefined editable fields.

### How to launch

<Steps>
1.  Navigate to your **Library**.
2.  Find the Document Template you want to use.
3.  Click **Launch Document** on the template card.
    *Alternatively, you can click **Launch Document** from within the Document Template editor.*

4.  A **kick-off form** will appear. This form contains all the editable [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) you added to the document template.

5.  Fill in the required information in the kick-off form fields.
6.  Once all required fields are complete, click the **Launch Document** button at the bottom of the form.

</Steps>

Tallyfy now creates a launched instance of the document, populating it with the information you entered.

### Viewing and editing the launched document

After launching:

<Steps>
1.  The launched document instance will open. You can see the fixed content combined with the data you entered.
2.  To **preview** or **download** the filled document, click the **Preview** button (often a printer or eye icon, depending on context).

3.  To **edit** the information you entered, click the **Edit** button (pencil icon) next to the fields section. This will reopen the form view allowing you to update the values.
</Steps>
