## What are document templates?

Document templates in Tallyfy let you create policies, reference materials, and guides where people don't need to follow a strict sequence. They're smart forms[^1] - your standard text and formatting stays locked, but editable fields let users add their specific details.

Unlike [procedure templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) built for sequential workflows, document templates work best for information sharing that doesn't need task sequencing or dependencies.

You can also publish document templates in [knowledge-only mode](/products/pro/tutorials/knowledge-only-mode/) - making them searchable reference materials without launching a formal process. Great for policies, guidelines, and SOPs that people need to read but not track.

### Why use document templates?

- **Brand consistency** - every document looks the same across all teams (fonts, layout, appearance)
- **Speed** - users fill in the blanks instead of starting from scratch
- **Protection** - standard content stays locked, so nobody can accidentally break it
- **Central updates** - change the template once and all future documents reflect it
- **Any device** - works on phone, tablet, or computer with no downloads needed

### How they're structured

Document templates have two parts:

1. **Fixed content** - your standard text, formatting, headers, footers. Users can't edit these sections
2. **Editable fields** - the blanks users fill in (names, dates, specific details)

### What you can create

- **Corporate policies** (social media guidelines, remote work rules, code of conduct)
- **Procedural guidance** (client communication scripts, meeting protocols, escalation paths)
- **Reference materials** (vendor contacts, security codes, resource lists)
- **Legal documents** (contracts, agreements, compliance forms, terms of service)
- **Business proposals** (sales decks, project proposals, partnership agreements)
- **Intake forms** (client info sheets, vendor onboarding, assessment questionnaires)
- **Standard operating instructions** (equipment guides, safety procedures, tech manuals)

### Launching a document template

When you launch a document template:

1. Tallyfy creates a fresh copy as an active process you can track
2. Users can only change the fields you've marked as editable - everything else stays locked
3. Every completed document matches your template's intended format

### Tallyfy documents vs. traditional files

Tallyfy documents fix common problems with traditional file-based documents:

- **Auto-formatting** - templates handle fonts and margins automatically
- **Clear boundaries** - editable fields are highlighted, locked content isn't touchable
- **Single version** - one document, one location. No "Final_v3_REALLY_final.docx" problem
- **Snippets** - use snippets[^2] to drop reusable text blocks across documents
- **Translation** - built-in content translation for global teams
- **Cross-platform** - same experience on phones, tablets, and computers

### Tallyfy documents vs. Microsoft Word

| Feature | Tallyfy documents | Microsoft Word |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Main use** | Online reading and collaboration | Primarily print-focused |
| **Formatting** | Consistent company-wide style, auto-cleaned text | Manual formatting per document |
| **Table of contents** | Auto-generated from headings | Manual creation and updates |
| **Version control** | Single version with tracked changes | Multiple file versions |
| **Collaboration** | Role-based access tied to workflows | File sharing with limited live co-editing |
| **Images** | Web-optimized with sizing options | More print formatting options |

:::tip[Moving from Word to Tallyfy]
When copying from Word, bring over the text first, then structure it with Tallyfy headings (H1, H2, H3). Tallyfy strips Word's formatting on paste, so your documents stay clean and consistent.
