## Document templates

Document templates provide standardized layouts for frequently used business documents with editable fields for customization while maintaining consistent formatting and content.

### Key benefits of document templates

- **Consistency** - Core content remains unchanged across all document instances
- **Efficiency** - Users only need to fill in variable information
- **Quality control** - Prevent unwanted modifications to standard text
- **Centralized management** - Update templates once to affect all future instances
- **Mobile accessibility** - View and complete on any device without downloads

### Document structure

Each document template contains two types of content:

1. **Read-only content** - Fixed text, formatting, and structure that remains consistent
2. **Editable fields** - Customizable areas that can be modified with specific information

### Working with documents

#### Creating document templates
Create standardized templates for frequently used documents such as:
- Contracts
- Sales proposals
- Legal forms
- Client onboarding packets
- Standard operating procedures

#### Using document templates
When you launch a document template:
1. A new instance is created as a process
2. Only designated fields can be edited
3. The document maintains consistency with the original template

#### Digital vs. traditional documents

The digital document approach eliminates common issues with downloaded documents:
- No manual formatting required
- Clear distinction between editable and non-editable content
- No risk of inconsistent versions circulating
- Support for reusable content blocks (snippets)
- Automatic language translation capabilities when needed
- Cross-device compatibility
