## Understanding document templates

Document templates in Tallyfy help you create policies, reference materials, and guides where people don't need to follow a strict sequence. Think of them as smart forms - they keep your documents looking perfect while saving hours of formatting time.

Here's how they work. Document templates lock down your standard text and formatting, but include editable fields where users add their specific details. Perfect consistency meets real-world flexibility.

Unlike [procedure templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) designed for sequential step-by-step workflows (such as employee onboarding processes), document templates excel for information sharing that doesn't need strict task sequencing or workflow dependencies.

### Advantages of document templates

- **Brand Consistency**: Every document looks exactly the same - same fonts, same layout, same professional appearance across all teams
- **Operational Efficiency**: What used to take hours now takes minutes. Users just fill in the blanks instead of starting from scratch
- **Quality Assurance**: Nobody can accidentally mess up your standard content. The important stuff stays locked while users customize what they need
- **Centralized Updates**: Change the template once, and all future documents get the update. No more hunting down outdated versions
- **Universal Accessibility**: Works on any device - phone, tablet, computer. No downloads, no special software

Three customer case studies show these changes cut document creation time by 70%. That's real time back in your day.

### Document template structure

Document templates have two parts:

1. **Fixed Content Sections**: The stuff that never changes - your standard text, formatting, headers, footers. Users can't touch these parts, which keeps everything consistent
2. **Dynamic Editable Fields**: The blanks users fill in. Name fields, dates, specific details - whatever makes each document unique

Simple. Your documents stay on-brand while users add what they need.

### Working with document templates

#### Types of document templates you can create
You can build templates for pretty much any document your organization uses:
- **Corporate Policies** (social media guidelines, remote work rules, code of conduct)
- **Procedural Guidance** (how to talk to clients, meeting protocols, escalation paths)
- **Reference Materials** (vendor contacts, security codes, resource lists)
- **Legal Documents** (contracts, agreements, compliance forms, terms of service)
- **Business Proposals** (sales decks, project proposals, partnership agreements)
- **Intake Forms** (client info sheets, vendor onboarding, assessment questionnaires)
- **Standard Operating Instructions** (equipment guides, safety procedures, tech manuals)

We've seen companies use these templates for 95% of their documents. Hours of work become minutes.

#### Deploying document templates
When you launch a document template, here's what happens:
1. **Instance Creation**: Tallyfy creates a fresh copy of your template as an active process. You can track who's working on it and when
2. **Controlled Editing**: Users can only change the fields you've marked as editable. Everything else stays locked
3. **Consistent Output**: Every completed document looks exactly like your template intended

Launch, fill in, done. Each document meets your standards without the hassle.

#### Digital documents vs. traditional files

Remember wrestling with Word documents? Tallyfy online documents fix those headaches:
- **Automated Formatting**: No more fiddling with fonts and margins. Your templates handle all the formatting automatically
- **Clear Edit Boundaries**: You can instantly see what's editable (highlighted fields) and what's locked. No accidents
- **Version Control**: One document, one location. No more "Final_v3_REALLY_final.docx" chaos
- **Content Reusability**: Use snippets to drop in standard text blocks. Write once, use everywhere
- **Multilingual Support**: Built-in translation for global teams (yes, really)
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works the same on phones, tablets, computers. No weird formatting issues

Bottom line? You spend 90% less time managing documents and more time getting actual work done.

### Tallyfy Documents vs. Microsoft Word

Here's how Tallyfy documents compare to programs like Microsoft Word:

| Feature | Tallyfy Documents | Microsoft Word |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Main Use** | Reading and working together online | Mostly for printing, but can be used online |
| **Formatting** | Consistent style set for the whole company; text is cleaned up | Manual formatting for each document |
| **Navigation (TOC)** | Table of contents made automatically from headings | Table of contents needs to be created and updated manually |
| **Version Control** | One main version; changes are tracked | Often results in many different file versions |
| **Working Together** | Real-time access based on roles; connects to workflows | Sharing files; fewer options for working together live |
| **Images** | Optimized for web viewing; sizing options | More formatting options for print and screen |

:::tip[Moving from Word to Tallyfy]
When copying text from Word into Tallyfy, focus on bringing over the words first. Then, use Tallyfy headings (H1, H2, H3) to structure the content. Tallyfy removes Word's formatting when you paste, ensuring your documents look clean and consistent with your company's style.
