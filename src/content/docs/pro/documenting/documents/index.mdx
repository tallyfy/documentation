## What are document templates?

[Document templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) provide standardized layouts for frequently used business documents with editable [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) for customization while maintaining consistent formatting and content.

### Key benefits of Document templates

- **Consistency** - Core content remains unchanged across all document instances
- **Efficiency** - Users only need to fill in variable information
- **Quality control** - Prevent unwanted modifications to standard text
- **Centralized management** - Update templates once to affect all future instances
- **Mobile accessibility** - View and complete on any device without downloads

### Document structure

Each document template contains two types of content:

1. **Read-only content** - Fixed text, formatting, and structure that remains consistent
2. **Editable [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/)** - Customizable areas that can be modified with specific information

### Working with Documents

#### Creating Document templates
Create standardized templates for frequently used documents such as:
- Contracts
- Sales proposals
- Legal forms
- Client onboarding packets
- Standard operating procedures

#### Using Document templates
When you [launch](/products/pro/launching/) a document template:
1. A new instance is created as a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)
2. Only designated [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) can be edited
3. The document maintains consistency with the original template

#### Digital vs. traditional documents

The digital document approach eliminates common issues with downloaded documents:
- No manual formatting required
- Clear distinction between editable and non-editable content
- No risk of inconsistent versions circulating
- Support for reusable content blocks ([snippets](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/))
- Automatic [language translation](/products/pro/miscellaneous/how-can-i-translate-content-in-tallyfy/) capabilities when needed
- Cross-device compatibility

### Tallyfy Documents vs. Microsoft Word

When choosing between Tallyfy and traditional word processors like Microsoft Word, consider these key differences:

| Feature | Tallyfy | Microsoft Word |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| **Primary purpose** | Digital reading and collaboration | Print-oriented with digital features |
| **Formatting** | Global brand styling with sanitized content | Manual, document-specific formatting |
| **Navigation** | Automatic table of contents from semantic headings | Manual table of contents creation and updates |
| **Version control** | Single source of truth with audit trail | Multiple file versions and tracking changes |
| **Collaboration** | Real-time, role-based access with workflow integration | File sharing with more limited collaboration options |
| **Image handling** | Web-optimized with customizable sizing | Print and screen resolution with more formatting options |

:::tip[Transitioning from Word]
When moving content from Word to Tallyfy, focus on transferring the text content first, then applying structure through headings. Tallyfy will strip Word's formatting when you copy/paste to ensure clean, consistent styling across your organization.
