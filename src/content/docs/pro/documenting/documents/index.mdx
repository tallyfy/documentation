## What are document templates?

[Document templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) are like pre-made layouts for business documents you use often. They have standard text and formatting that stays the same, but also include editable [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) (blanks) that people can fill in with specific details.

### Key benefits of Document templates

- **Consistency**: Ensures the main parts of your documents always look the same.
- **Efficiency**: Saves time because users only need to fill in the blanks.
- **Quality control**: Prevents accidental changes to standard information.
- **Easy updates**: Change the template once, and all future documents created from it are updated.
- **Works anywhere**: View and complete documents on any device (phone, tablet, computer) without downloading files.

### Document structure

Document templates have two main parts:

1. **Fixed content**: Text, formatting, and structure that cannot be changed by users.
2. **Editable [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/)**: Areas where users can add specific information.

### Working with Documents

#### Creating Document templates
You can create standard templates for documents like:
- Contracts
- Sales proposals
- Legal forms
- Client information forms
- Standard instructions (SOPs)

#### Using Document templates
When you use ([launch](/products/pro/launching/)) a document template:
1. Tallyfy creates a new instance of it as a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).
2. Users can only edit the specific [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) you set up.
3. The final document looks consistent and matches the original template.

#### Digital documents vs. traditional documents

Using Tallyfy's online documents avoids common problems with downloaded files (like Word docs):
- No need to manually format the document.
- It's clear which parts can be edited and which parts cannot.
- Avoids confusion from having multiple different versions of a file.
- You can reuse common blocks of text ([snippets](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/)).
- Automatic [language translation](/products/pro/miscellaneous/how-can-i-translate-content-in-tallyfy/) is available if needed.
- Works well on any device.

### Tallyfy Documents vs. Microsoft Word

Here's how Tallyfy documents compare to programs like Microsoft Word:

| Feature | Tallyfy Documents | Microsoft Word |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Main Use** | Reading and working together online | Mostly for printing, but can be used online |
| **Formatting** | Consistent style set for the whole company; text is cleaned up | Manual formatting for each document |
| **Navigation (TOC)** | Table of contents made automatically from headings | Table of contents needs to be created and updated manually |
| **Version Control** | One main version; changes are tracked | Often results in many different file versions |
| **Working Together** | Real-time access based on roles; connects to workflows | Sharing files; fewer options for working together live |
| **Images** | Optimized for web viewing; sizing options | More formatting options for print and screen |

:::tip[Moving from Word to Tallyfy]
When copying text from Word into Tallyfy, focus on bringing over the words first. Then, use Tallyfy's headings (H1, H2, H3) to structure the content. Tallyfy removes Word's formatting when you paste, ensuring your documents look clean and consistent with your company's style.
