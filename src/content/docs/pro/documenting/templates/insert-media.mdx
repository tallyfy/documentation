## Adding media to tasks

You can add pictures, videos, files, tables, and links directly into task descriptions in Tallyfy templates - just click the **Insert** button in the editor toolbar. This makes your instructions crystal clear, especially when you're explaining something visual or complex.

### What you need for adding media
- A template opened in edit mode
- The image, video, or file you want to add (if uploading)
- The web address (URL) if linking to online content

### Types of media you can add

Here's what you can add to task descriptions (yes, it's quite a lot):

| Media Type | How it looks | Size Limit (if uploading) |
|------------|--------------|--------------------------|
| Images | Shows the picture (JPG, PNG, GIF) | 100MB |
| Files | Shows a link to download the file (Docs, PDFs, etc.) | 100MB |
| Videos | Plays the video (uploaded or linked) | 100MB |
| Links | Clickable web link | N/A |
| Tables | Organizes info in rows/columns | N/A |
| URLs | Shows as a clickable web link | N/A |

1. Open the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in **Edit** mode
2. Click on the [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) step where you want to add media
3. Click inside the description box where you want the media to appear
4. Click the **Insert** button in the editor toolbar above the description

</Steps>

Each media type works a bit differently - here's exactly how to add each one.

### Instructions for each media type

#### Adding images
<Steps>
1. Choose **Image** from the Insert menu
2. Pick one:
   - **Upload**: Choose an image file from your computer
   - **URL**: Paste the web address of an image found online
3. *(Optional but recommended)* Add a short description of the image in the alt text box (helps people using screen readers)
4. Click **Insert**
</Steps>

#### Adding files
<Steps>
1. Choose **File** from the Insert menu
2. Click **Upload** and choose a file from your computer
3. Wait for it to upload
4. A link to download the file will appear in the description
</Steps>

#### Adding videos
<Steps>
1. Choose **Video** from the Insert menu
2. Pick one:
   - **Upload**: Choose a video file (MP4, WebM) from your computer (max 100MB)
   - **URL**: Paste a link from YouTube, Vimeo, or another video site
3. Click **Insert**
</Steps>

:::tip[Best way to add videos]
Uploading videos works, but it's usually better to upload your video to YouTube or Vimeo first, then paste the link into Tallyfy. Why? Better quality, smoother playback, and it won't eat up your storage space. Use the **URL** option above or try **Embed URL** below.

#### Adding tables
<Steps>
1. Choose **Table** from the Insert menu
2. Select how many rows and columns you need
3. Click **Insert**
4. Click inside the table cells to type your information
</Steps>

#### Adding links
<Steps>
1. Choose **Link** from the Insert menu
2. Paste the web address you want to link to in the **URL** box
3. *(Optional)* Type the words you want the link to display in the **Text to display** box (e.g., "Click here for details") - if you leave this blank, the full web address will show
4. Click **Insert**
</Steps>

#### Adding page breaks

If you're editing a Document template, you can add page breaks to control where new pages start when printing or saving as PDF. Perfect for keeping related content together.

<Steps>
1. Click where you want the page break
2. Choose **Page Break** from the Insert menu
3. A line will appear showing the page break
</Steps>

#### Using Embed URL

Want to show a preview of content from other websites right in your task description? That's what Embed URL does - it pulls in live content instead of just showing a link.

<Steps>
1. Choose **Embed URL** from the Insert menu
2. Paste the web address (URL) of the content (e.g., a YouTube video page, a Tweet, a Google Map)
3. Click **Insert**
</Steps>

:::tip[What can you embed?]
Tallyfy works with hundreds of sites - YouTube, Vimeo, Spotify, Instagram, Twitter, Google Maps, and tons more. The embedded content stays interactive too. Much slicker than uploading files.

### Best practices for using media
- Use pictures to show steps that are hard to explain in words
- Attach files people need to reference while doing the task
- Use videos to demonstrate how something works
- Keep uploaded files under 20MB if you can - they'll load faster for everyone
- Always add alt text to images (helps people using screen readers)
- Use tables when you've got data to organize
