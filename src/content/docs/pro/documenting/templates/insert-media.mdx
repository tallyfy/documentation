:::tip[Best practice for videos]
While you can upload videos directly (up to 100MB), we recommend hosting your videos with a dedicated video hosting service (like YouTube, Vimeo, etc.) and embedding them instead. This provides better video performance, reliability, and features like adaptive streaming. The rich text editor supports embedding from over 400 providers of videos, audio, photos, and products using the embed URL option.

2. Select **Page Break** from the Insert dropdown.

#### Using the Embed URL option

Instead of uploading media files directly, you can embed external content using the **Embed URL** option:

<Steps>

3. Click **Insert**
</Steps>

:::tip[Embedding capabilities]
Tallyfy supports embedding from over 400 different providers of videos, audio, photos, and products. This means you can embed content from platforms like YouTube, Vimeo, Spotify, SoundCloud, Instagram, Twitter, Google Maps, and many more, all while maintaining a preview of the content directly in your task descriptions.

Using the Embed URL option often provides better performance and additional features compared to direct uploads, while also saving storage space in your Tallyfy account.

### Best practices for media in tasks
- Use images to illustrate complex procedures
- Include reference files that might be needed to complete the task
- Add videos for demonstrations of [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)
- Keep media files under 20MB when possible for faster loading
- Provide descriptive alt text for images to improve accessibility
- Use tables to organize structured information
