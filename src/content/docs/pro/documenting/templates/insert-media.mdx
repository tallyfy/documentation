:::tip[Best way to add videos]
It's usually better to upload your video to YouTube or Vimeo first, then paste the link into Tallyfy. Better quality, smoother playback, and it won't use your storage. Use **URL** above or **Embed URL** below.

### Tips for using media
- Use images to show steps that are hard to explain in words
- Attach files people need while doing the task
- Use videos to demonstrate how something works
- Keep uploaded files under 20MB[^2] when possible - they'll load faster
- Add alt text to images for accessibility
- Use tables to organize structured data

[^1]: Alt text is required for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance and improves SEO ranking
[^2]: Files larger than 20MB may cause timeout errors on slower connections (under 10 Mbps)
