### What are best practices for using media effectively in tasks?
- Use pictures to show steps that are hard to explain in words, improving comprehension.
- Attach files that people need to reference to do the task, providing necessary resources.
- Use videos to show how to do something, offering dynamic instruction.
- Try to keep uploaded file sizes reasonable (under 20MB if possible) so they load faster for all users.
- Always add alt text to images for people who can't see them, ensuring accessibility.
- Use tables to show data clearly, organizing information for easy consumption.

These practices ensure your media enhances rather than complicates the task completion process.
