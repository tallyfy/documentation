## Adding media to tasks

You can add pictures, videos, files, tables, and links into task descriptions in your templates. This gives clearer instructions and useful resources that help people complete tasks better.

Visual and multimedia elements improve task clarity and reduce the need for additional explanations.

### What you need for adding media
- A template opened in edit mode
- The image, video, or file you want to add (if uploading)
- The web address (URL) if linking to online content

These requirements make sure you can successfully add media to task descriptions.

### Types of media you can add

You can add these types of media to task descriptions for improved clarity and functionality:

| Media Type | How it looks | Size Limit (if uploading) |
|------------|--------------|--------------------------|
| Images | Shows the picture (JPG, PNG, GIF) | 100MB |
| Files | Shows a link to download the file (Docs, PDFs, etc.) | 100MB |
| Videos | Plays the video (uploaded or linked) | 100MB |
| Links | Clickable web link | N/A |
| Tables | Organizes info in rows/columns | N/A |
| URLs | Shows as a clickable web link | N/A |

### Instructions for each media type

#### Adding images

#### Adding files
<Steps>
1. Choose **File** from the Insert menu
2. Click **Upload** and choose a file from your computer

#### Adding videos
<Steps>

   - **URL**: Paste a link from YouTube, Vimeo, or another video site
3. Click **Insert**
</Steps>

:::tip[Best way to add videos]
Uploading videos works, but it's usually better to upload your video to a service like YouTube or Vimeo first. Then, paste the video's web link (URL) into Tallyfy using the **URL** option above or the **Embed URL** option below. This usually gives better quality and playback.

#### Adding page breaks

If you're editing a Document template, you can add a page break to control where a new page starts when printing or saving as PDF. This helps maintain professional document formatting and structure.

2. Choose **Page Break** from the Insert menu

2. Paste the web address (URL) of the content (e.g., a YouTube video page, a Tweet, a Google Map)
3. Click **Insert**
</Steps>

:::tip[What can you embed?]
Tallyfy can embed content from hundreds of sites, including YouTube, Vimeo, Spotify, Instagram, Twitter, Google Maps, and more. This often looks better and works better than just uploading files.

### Best practices for using media
- Use pictures to show steps that are hard to explain in words, improving comprehension
- Attach files that people need to reference to do the task, providing necessary resources
- Use videos to show how to do something, offering dynamic instruction
- Try to keep uploaded file sizes reasonable (under 20MB if possible) so they load faster for all users
- Always add alt text to images for people who can't see them, ensuring accessibility
- Use tables to show data clearly, organizing information for easy consumption

These practices help your media improve rather than complicate task completion.
