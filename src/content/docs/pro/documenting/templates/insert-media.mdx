## Adding pictures, videos, and files to tasks

- The image, video, or file you want to add (if uploading).

### What you can add

You can add these types of media to task descriptions:

| Media Type | How it looks | Size Limit (if uploading) |
|------------|--------------|--------------------------|
| Images | Shows the picture (JPG, PNG, GIF) | 100MB |
| Files | Shows a link to download the file (Docs, PDFs, etc.) | 100MB |
| Videos | Plays the video (uploaded or linked) | 100MB |
| Links | Clickable web link | N/A |
| Tables | Organizes info in rows/columns | N/A |
| URLs | Shows as a clickable web link | N/A |

</Steps>

Follow the specific instructions below based on the media type you chose.

### Instructions for each media type

#### Adding Images
<Steps>
1. Choose **Image** from the Insert menu.
2. Pick one:
   - **Upload**: Choose an image file from your computer.
   - **URL**: Paste the web address of an image found online.
3. *(Optional but recommended)* Add a short description of the image in the alt text box (helps people using screen readers).
4. Click **Insert**.
</Steps>

#### Adding Files
<Steps>
1. Choose **File** from the Insert menu.
2. Click **Upload** and choose a file from your computer.
3. Wait for it to upload.

</Steps>

#### Adding Videos
<Steps>
1. Choose **Video** from the Insert menu.
2. Pick one:
   - **Upload**: Choose a video file (MP4, WebM) from your computer (max 100MB).
   - **URL**: Paste a link from YouTube, Vimeo, or another video site.
3. Click **Insert**.
</Steps>

:::tip[Best way to add videos]
Uploading videos works, but it's usually better to upload your video to a service like YouTube or Vimeo first. Then, paste the video's web link (URL) into Tallyfy using the **URL** option above or the **Embed URL** option below. This usually gives better quality and playback.

2. Paste the web address you want to link to in the **URL** box.
3. *(Optional)* Type the words you want the link to display in the **Text to display** box (e.g., "Click here for details"). If you leave this blank, the full web address will show.
4. Click **Insert**.
</Steps>

#### Adding Page Breaks (for Documents)

If you are editing a [Document template](/products/pro/documenting/documents/), you can add a page break to control where a new page starts when printing or saving as PDF.

<Steps>
1. Click where you want the page break.
2. Choose **Page Break** from the Insert menu.
3. A line will appear showing the page break.
</Steps>

#### Using Embed URL (for many types of online content)

This option lets you show a preview of content from many different websites directly in your task description.

<Steps>
1. Choose **Embed URL** from the Insert menu.
2. Paste the web address (URL) of the content (e.g., a YouTube video page, a Tweet, a Google Map).
3. Click **Insert**.
</Steps>

:::tip[What can you embed?]
Tallyfy can embed content from hundreds of sites, including YouTube, Vimeo, Spotify, Instagram, Twitter, Google Maps, and more. This often looks better and works better than just uploading files.

### Tips for using media in tasks
- Use pictures to show steps that are hard to explain in words.
- Attach files that people need to reference to do the task.
- Use videos to show how to do something.
- Try to keep uploaded file sizes reasonable (under 20MB if possible) so they load faster.
- Always add alt text to images for people who can't see them.
- Use tables to show data clearly.
