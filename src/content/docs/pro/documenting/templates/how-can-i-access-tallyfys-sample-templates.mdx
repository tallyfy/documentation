## Using Tallyfy's sample templates

You can import ready-made templates from Tallyfy's library in just a few clicks - they cover everything from employee onboarding to sales processes. These templates give you a massive head start.

Why build from scratch? The templates come from real companies who've refined these workflows over years. You get their best practices instantly. Just import, tweak for your team, and you're ready to go.

Here's what you need to know about finding and using them.

### Benefits of sample templates

Let's be honest - nobody wants to stare at a blank template. Sample templates solve that problem:

- **Faster setup**: Launch your first process in minutes, not hours
- **Learn best practices**: See how successful companies structure their workflows (it's like having a consultant show you what works)
- **Stay consistent**: Every department uses the same proven process structure
- **Understand templates**: The best way to learn? Start with working examples
- **Save time**: We're talking 80% faster deployment compared to building from zero

Think of it this way: you wouldn't code a CRM from scratch when you could customize Salesforce. Same principle here.

### Finding sample templates

Two places to grab templates - pick whichever's easier for you:

1. **Tallyfy's Public Template Library**
   - Head to [Tallyfy's Public Library](https://go.tallyfy.com/public/library)
   - Templates are sorted by category - HR, Marketing, you name it
   - Preview everything before importing (no surprises)
   - One click imports it straight to your account. Done.

2. **Inside Your Tallyfy Account**
   - Go to Templates in your dashboard
   - Click **Import** or **New Template**
   - Pick **Sample Templates**
   - Browse categories and grab what you need

Both ways get you the same templates. The public library's great for browsing before you commit - the in-app option's faster if you know what you want.

### Available template categories

#### Marketing templates
- New Email Campaign for marketing communications
- Facebook Ad Creation for social media advertising

- Request for System Access for security management

#### Onboarding templates

That's 20+ templates covering pretty much every department. If you can't find what you need here, you've got a really unique business.

### Customizing sample templates

Got your template imported? Perfect. Now make it yours:

<Steps>
1. Review the workflow - does the flow make sense for your team?
2. Rename steps to match your company's language (we say "Manager Review", maybe you say "Supervisor Approval")
3. Fix the assignments - replace the generic roles with your actual people
4. Add or cut steps as needed - no template is sacred
5. Update the [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to capture your specific data
6. Adjust deadlines - what takes us 2 days might take you 1 hour
7. Always run a test - [launch](/products/pro/launching/) a dummy [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) before going live
</Steps>

### Organizing imported templates

After importing a few templates, things can get messy fast. Here's how to stay organized:

- Create folders by department or process type - whatever makes sense for your team
- Name templates clearly: "Employee Onboarding v2" beats "HR Process 3"
- Tag everything - you'll thank yourself when you're searching through 50+ templates
- Document major changes - add a note like "Added legal review step for California compliance"

Trust me, spending 5 minutes organizing now saves hours of hunting later. Nothing worse than knowing you have the perfect template somewhere but can't find it.
