### Customizing sample templates

After importing a template, make it yours:

<Steps>
1. Review the workflow - does the flow make sense for your team?
2. Rename steps to match your company's language
3. Fix the assignments - replace generic roles with your actual people
4. Add or cut steps as needed
5. Update the [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to capture your specific data
6. Adjust deadlines to match your team's pace
7. Run a test - [launch](/products/pro/launching/) a dummy [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) before going live
</Steps>

### Organizing imported templates

- Create folders by department or process type
- Name templates clearly - "Employee Onboarding v2" beats "HR Process 3"
- Tag templates so they're easy to find later
- Document major changes with notes like "Added legal review step for California compliance"
