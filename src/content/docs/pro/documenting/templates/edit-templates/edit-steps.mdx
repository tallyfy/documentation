## How to edit steps in a template

This article explains how to add new steps and edit existing steps in a template.

## Add a new step

To add a new step to a template, scroll down through the step list until you find the **Add Step** option. Enter a name for your new step to create it.


## Editing steps

To edit any step, first access the template edit view:

- From the sidebar, select the **Templates** option.
- Once there, select the **Edit** option in the template you want to modify or add a step.

The following sections explain what can be changed in a template's steps.

### Editing/adding a description to a step

The description in any step is a representation of the task that needs to be completed. It can include images, files, URLs, tables, and videos, as well as any [variable](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/) or [snippet](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/) of your choice. To start adding a description to your step:

- Click on the specific step you want to edit and select the **Description** option.
- You'll be greeted with a rich text editor that allows you to format your text in any way you want.
- Your changes will be saved automatically.

### Assigning/ Re-assigning steps

Tallyfy allows you to assign either a coworker, a group of people, a guest to any step, or leave it unassigned. Simply follow the next steps:

- Click on the specific step you want to edit and select the **Assign** option.
- You can then add or remove any assignee of your choice by simply typing its name or email in the case of assigning a guest.
- You can also select **Nobody right now** if you want to create the step without an assignee. This allows you to create tasks that can be assigned later as needed.
- You can check the **"enforce a maximum number of assignees?"** to establish a maximum number of assignees in a step

:::note[Important: Nobody right now and Assign launcher automatically]
When you select **Nobody right now**, the behavior of the task after launching depends on the **Assign launcher automatically** setting in the **Advanced** tab:

- If **Assign launcher automatically** is ON: The process launcher will be automatically assigned to the task
- If **Assign launcher automatically** is OFF: The task will remain unassigned (nobody assigned)

See the [Advanced tab documentation](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-can-i-utilize-tallyfys-advanced-tab-features/) for more details.

:::note[Note on groups]

If you want to assign a task to a specific group of people, you'll have to set up the group before assigning it, for more information on how to create and modify groups, head over to this [article.](/products/pro/documenting/groups/how-to-manage-groups-and-assign-tasks-in-tallyfy/)

### Changing the type of step

:::note[Detailed explanation on step types]

Check this [article](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-types-of-tasks-can-i-create-with-tallyfy/) if you're looking for a detailed explanation of step types

:::

To change the type of a step:

- Click on the specific step you want to edit and simply click on **Type**, this will drop a menu where you can select the type of task you want that step to be.

### Add/change form fields

You can change or add a form field by following these steps:

- Click on the specific step and then select the **Form fields** options.
- You can then select the form field you want to edit, or click on **Add field** to add a new form field to your step.

For a detailed explanation of form fields and how can they be useful for your processes, go to this [article.](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/)

### Change the timings/deadline of a step

To allow you full control over a step deadline, you can set up how many time before/after launch or before/after a specific step has been completed.

- Click on your step, and then select the **Timings** section.
- In this menu, you can set up the deadline as you wish to. By default, every step's deadline is relative to when you launch a process, however, you can set it up so that the deadline for a task is calculated once another step has been completed by selecting **TIME > after > ANOTHER STEP**.

![Image](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-setup-deadline-after-completion-example.png)

- You can specify if you want to  _advise_ but not enforce that the assignees _should_ start working on a step after a specific time, rather than  immediately. This is done by using the toggle "Start On-time" or "Start Anytime". The default is "Start Anytime" which means "Start doing this task anytime you like - no need to wait".

### Advanced settings

Tallyfy allows for advanced customization in your steps. Here's a brief explanation of every option we provide.

- **Launch another process when this task is complete**: By selecting this option, you can launch a process when the step is completed. Once selected, you may specify the process you want to launch that **Doesn't have a REQUIRED kick-off form**, whether or not you want to inject(add) the tasks of the selected template to be launched into the current process, or not, and if you want to specify the name of the process or not. (By default, it will be the date and time, and the name of the template). We have a dedicated article on this process, just follow this [link.](/products/pro/launching/launch-process-when-task-is-completed/)

:::note[Injecting tasks]

If you mark this option as "yes", rather than spawning a new process when the task is completed, it will add all the tasks of the template selected to the current process.

:::

- **All assignees must complete this task**: This will ensure that the task won't be considered as complete until every assignee completes it.

- **Assign launcher automatically**: This setting determines what happens when a step has no assignees. When turned ON, the person who launches the process will be automatically assigned to the task if it has no other assignees. When turned OFF, the task will remain unassigned if no assignees are specified. This setting also affects guest user assignments:
  - ON: If only guests are assigned, both the launcher and guests will be assigned
  - OFF: If only guests are assigned, only the guests will be assigned

- **Task is mandatory and cannot be removed at launch**: If selected, it will make the task unable to be removed from the process and it will be mandatory to complete.

- **Only assigned members can complete this task**: If selected, only assigned members will be able to complete the task. This setting applies to all task types, including approve/reject tasks. When enabled, only the specifically assigned members to the task can complete, approve, reject, or edit it. This restriction does not apply to users with Administrator roles, as they always maintain full access to all tasks.

- **Prevent guests from making or seeing comments**: If selected, any guest assigned to a task won't be able to comment on it.

- **Tags**: This is an optional field, where you can select a series of tags to better organize your templates and processes.
