## How to edit steps in a template

This guide explains how to add new steps and change existing steps within a process [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).

:::note[Who can edit steps?]
[Members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) with a "Light" role cannot edit templates or their steps. Only "Standard" members (if allowed by an Admin) or "Administrator" members can edit steps.
:::

### Add a new step

To add a step, open the template in Edit mode. Scroll to the bottom of the steps list and click **Add Step**. Type a name for your new step and press Enter.


### Editing an existing step

First, open the template for editing:
- Go to the **Templates** library.
- Find the template and click the **Edit** icon (pencil).

Once in edit mode, click on any step in the list to open its details panel (usually on the right). Here's what you can edit:

#### Editing the step description
This is where you write the instructions for the [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/). You can add text, formatting, images, files, links, tables, videos, [variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/), and [snippets](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/).

<Steps>
1. Click on the step you want to edit.
2. Click into the **Description** area in the details panel.

3. Use the toolbar to format text, add links, images, etc. See [Insert Media](/products/pro/documenting/templates/insert-media/) for details.
4. Changes save automatically.
</Steps>

:::tip[Use videos for clear instructions]
A short video (like a screen recording) can often explain a step better than lots of text. Consider embedding videos for complex tasks.
:::

#### Changing who is assigned
You can set who should do this task.

<Steps>
1. Click on the step you want to assign.
2. Go to the **Assign** tab in the details panel.
3. Choose how to assign:
    - **Specific Person/Group**: Pick members or groups from the list.
    - **[Job Title](/products/pro/documenting/templates/edit-templates/understanding-assignment-types/)**: Assign based on role (e.g., "Account Manager").
    - **[Guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-can-i-assign-tasks-to-guest-users-in-tallyfy/)**: Assign to someone outside your company using their email.
    - **Nobody right now**: Leave it unassigned initially. (See note below).
</Steps>

*   **If you choose "Nobody right now"**: What happens when the process runs depends on the **Assign launcher automatically** setting (in the Advanced tab). If ON, the person starting the process gets assigned. If OFF, the task stays unassigned.
*   **Assigning Groups**: You need to [create the group first](/products/pro/documenting/groups/how-to-manage-groups-and-assign-tasks-in-tallyfy/) before you can assign a task to it.

#### Changing the step type
Different step types behave differently (e.g., Approve/Reject steps have different buttons). See [Step Types Explained](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-types-of-tasks-can-i-create-with-tallyfy/) for details.

<Steps>
1. Click on the step you want to change.
2. Click the **Type** dropdown in the details panel and choose the new type.
</Steps>

#### Adding or changing form fields
Add fields to collect information during this step.

<Steps>
1. Click on the step.
2. Go to the **Form fields** tab in the details panel.
3. Click **Add field** to add a new one, or click an existing field to edit it.
</Steps>

See [Types of Form Fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) for more details.

#### Changing deadlines (Timings)
Set when the task should be due.

<Steps>
1. Click on the step.
2. Go to the **Timings** tab.
3. Set the deadline relative to:
    - **Process Launch**: Due X time after the process starts (default).
    - **Another Step**: Due X time after another specific step is completed.
   ![Image](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-setup-deadline-after-completion-example.png)
4. Choose **Start On-Time** (suggests a start time, but doesn't force it) or **Start Anytime** (no suggested start time, default).
</Steps>

#### Advanced Step Settings
These options offer more control over how the step works.

- **Launch another process when this task is complete**: Set to "Yes" to automatically start another process (from a different template) when this task finishes. You can choose to add the new tasks into the current process or start a completely separate one. See [Launch another process guide](/products/pro/launching/launch-process-when-task-is-completed/).
- **All assignees must complete this task**: If "Yes", the task isn't done until *everyone* assigned has marked it complete.
- **Assign launcher automatically**: If a step has *no* assignees set, turning this ON means the person who starts the process will automatically be assigned. If OFF, it remains unassigned.
- **Task is mandatory...**: If "Yes", this step cannot be removed when someone starts the process.
- **Only assigned members can complete or edit...**: If "Yes", only people directly assigned can work on or complete the task (except Administrators, who can always access it).
- **Emit webhook when completed**: If "Yes", Tallyfy sends an automatic notification to another web service (via a [webhook](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/)) when this task is done.
- **Prevent guests from making or seeing comments**: If "Yes", any [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) assigned won't see or be able to add comments on this task.
- **Unique Step Alias**: An internal ID for this specific step, mostly used for technical integrations via [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) or the [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/).
- **Tags**: Add organizational tags to this step.
