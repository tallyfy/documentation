## How to edit steps in a template

This article explains how to add new steps and edit existing steps in a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).

:::note[Role permission requirement]
[Members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) with a "Light" role cannot create or edit templates, including adding or editing steps. Only members with a "Standard" role (if they have appropriate permissions) or "Administrator" role can edit template steps.
:::

## Add a new step

To add a new step to a template, scroll down through the step list until you find the **Add Step** option. Enter a name for your new step to create it.


## Editing steps

To edit any step, first access the template edit view:

- From the sidebar, select the **Templates** option.
- Once there, select the **Edit** option in the template you want to modify or add a step.

The following sections explain what can be changed in a template's steps.

### Editing/adding a description to a step

The description in any step is a representation of the [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) that needs to be completed. It can include images, files, URLs, tables, and videos, as well as any [variable](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/) or [snippet](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/) of your choice. To start adding a description to your step:

- Click on the specific step you want to edit and select the **Description** option.
- You'll be greeted with a rich text editor that allows you to format your text in any way you want.
- Your changes will be saved automatically.

### Assigning/ Re-assigning steps

Tallyfy offers multiple assignment types to fit different workflow needs:

- **Fixed assignments**: When you know exactly who will do the [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) (people or groups)
- **[Job title assignments](/products/pro/documenting/templates/edit-templates/understanding-assignment-types/)**: When you know the role but not the specific person
- **[Guest assignments](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-can-i-assign-tasks-to-guest-users-in-tallyfy/)**: For external collaborators outside your organization

To assign a step in your template:

- Click on the specific step you want to edit and select the **Assign** option.
- Choose the appropriate assignment type based on your needs
- You can also select **Nobody right now** if you want to create the step without an assignee

When you select **Nobody right now**, the behavior of the [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) after [launching](/products/pro/launching/) depends on the **Assign launcher automatically** setting in the **Advanced** tab:

- If **Assign launcher automatically** is ON: The [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) launcher will be automatically assigned to the task
- If **Assign launcher automatically** is OFF: The task will remain unassigned (nobody assigned)

:::note[Note on groups]
If you want to assign a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to a specific group of people, you'll have to set up the group before assigning it, for more information on how to create and modify groups, head over to this [article.](/products/pro/documenting/groups/how-to-manage-groups-and-assign-tasks-in-tallyfy/)

### Changing the type of step

:::note[Detailed explanation on step types]

Check this [article](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-types-of-tasks-can-i-create-with-tallyfy/) if you're looking for a detailed explanation of step types

:::

To change the type of a step:

- Click on the specific step you want to edit and simply click on **Type**, this will drop a menu where you can select the type of [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) you want that step to be.

### Add/change form fields

You can change or add a [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) by following these steps:

- Click on the specific step and then select the **Form fields** options.
- You can then select the form field you want to edit, or click on **Add field** to add a new form field to your step.

For a detailed explanation of [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) and how can they be useful for your processes, go to this [article.](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/)

### Change the timings/deadline of a step

To allow you full control over a step deadline, you can set up how many time before/after [launch](/products/pro/launching/) or before/after a specific step has been completed.

- Click on your step, and then select the **Timings** section.
- In this menu, you can set up the deadline as you wish to. By default, every step's deadline is relative to when you [launch a process](/products/pro/launching/), however, you can set it up so that the deadline for a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) is calculated once another step has been completed by selecting **TIME > after > ANOTHER STEP**.

![Image](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-setup-deadline-after-completion-example.png)

- You can specify if you want to _advise_ but not enforce that the assignees _should_ start working on a step after a specific time, rather than immediately. This is done by using the toggle "Start On-time" or "Start Anytime".
  - **Start On-Time**: This option sets a preferred time when work on the task should begin. This is not enforced but provides guidance to assignees. It's useful when you want to indicate that a task shouldn't be started too early (for example, when new information might come to light that could require rework if the task was done prematurely).
  - **Start Anytime**: This is the default option, which means assignees can begin working on the task whenever they like, with no recommended start time.

### Advanced settings

Tallyfy allows for advanced customization in your steps. Here's a detailed explanation of each option:

- **[Launch another process](/products/pro/launching/launch-process-when-task-is-completed/) when this task is complete**: When set to "Yes", this feature allows you to automatically launch a new [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) using another template once you complete the task. After selecting a template to launch, you can choose whether to inject the [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) into the current process or create a separate process, and optionally customize the process name. For detailed instructions, see [Launch another process when a task is completed](/products/pro/launching/launch-process-when-task-is-completed/).

:::note[Injecting tasks]
If you mark this option as "yes", rather than spawning a new [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) when the [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) is completed, it will add all the tasks of the template selected to the current process.
:::

- **All assignees must complete this [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/)**: When set to "Yes", this ensures that the task won't be considered complete until every assigned [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) or [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) has completed it. A single person cannot mark the task as complete for everyone.

- **Assign launcher automatically**: This setting determines what happens when a step has no assignees. When turned ON, the person who [launches the process](/products/pro/launching/) will be automatically assigned to the [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) if it has no other assignees. When turned OFF, the task will remain unassigned if no assignees are specified. This setting also affects [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) user assignments:
  - ON: If only guests are assigned, both the launcher and guests will be assigned
  - OFF: If only guests are assigned, only the guests will be assigned

- **Task is mandatory and cannot be removed at launch**: When set to "Yes", this makes the [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) mandatory, ensuring it cannot be removed from the process at the start.

- **Only assigned members can complete or edit this [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/)**: When set to "Yes", only [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) explicitly assigned to the task can complete, approve, reject, or edit it. The task will be locked to anyone not assigned. Note that this restriction does not apply to users with Administrator roles, as they always maintain full access to all tasks regardless of this setting.

- **Emit [webhook](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) when completed**: When enabled, this allows you to set up a webhook that fires when the [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) is completed. This is useful for integrating Tallyfy with other applications and automating workflows. For more information, see [Details about webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/how-to-set-up-webhooks-in-tallyfy/).

- **Prevent [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) from making or seeing comments**: When set to "Yes", any guest assigned to the [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) won't be able to see existing comments or add new ones. This helps maintain privacy in guest-facing tasks.

- **Unique Step Alias**: This identifier is used to identify the specific step when using [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/). By combining this alias with a task ID or process ID, you can precisely locate any single [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in Tallyfy. This is particularly useful for webhook integrations and [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) operations.

- **Tags**: This is an optional field, where you can select a series of tags to better organize your [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) and [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).
