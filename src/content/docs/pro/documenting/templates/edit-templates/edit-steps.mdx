## How can I edit steps in a Tallyfy template?

This comprehensive guide demonstrates adding new steps and modifying existing steps within Tallyfy process [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), enabling precise workflow customization and optimization.

Mastering step editing capabilities in Tallyfy allows organizations to continuously refine their process templates, ensuring workflows remain aligned with evolving business requirements and operational improvements.

:::note[Who can edit steps?]
[Members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) with a "Light" role cannot edit templates or their steps. Only "Standard" members (if allowed by an Admin) or "Administrator" members can edit steps.
:::

### How do I add new steps to templates?

Adding new steps to templates expands workflow capabilities and accommodates evolving process requirements through straightforward template modification:

To add a step, access the template in Edit mode, scroll to the bottom of the existing steps list, click **Add Step**, type a descriptive name for your new step, and press Enter to confirm.


### How can I modify existing template steps?

Modifying existing template steps enables workflow refinement and process optimization without requiring complete template recreation.

To begin editing existing steps, first open the template for modification:
- Navigate to the **Templates** library interface
- Locate your target template and click the **Edit** icon (pencil symbol)

Once in edit mode, click on any step in the list to open its details panel in Tallyfy (usually on the right). Here's what you can edit:

#### How do I edit the step description?
This is where you write the instructions for the [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/). You can add text, formatting, images, files, links, tables, videos, [variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/), and [snippets](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/).

<Steps>
1. Click on the step you want to edit.
2. Click into the **Description** area in the details panel.

3. Use the toolbar to format text, add links, images, etc. See [Insert Media](/products/pro/documenting/templates/insert-media/) for details.
4. Tallyfy saves changes automatically.
</Steps>

:::tip[Use videos for clear instructions]
A short video (like a screen recording) can often explain a step better than lots of text. Consider embedding videos for complex tasks.
:::

#### How do I change who is assigned?
You can set who should do this task in Tallyfy.

<Steps>
1. Click on the step you want to assign.
2. Go to the **Assign** tab in the details panel.
3. Choose how to assign:
    - **Specific Person/Group**: Pick members or groups from the list.
    - **[Job Title](/products/pro/documenting/templates/edit-templates/understanding-assignment-types/)**: Assign based on role (e.g., "Account Manager").
    - **[Guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-can-i-assign-tasks-to-guest-users-in-tallyfy/)**: Assign to someone outside your company using their email.
    - **Nobody right now**: Leave it unassigned initially. (See note below).
</Steps>

*   **If you choose "Nobody right now"**: What happens when the process runs depends on the **Assign launcher automatically** setting (in the Advanced tab). If ON, the person starting the process gets assigned. If OFF, the task stays unassigned.
*   **Assigning Groups**: You need to [create the group first](/products/pro/documenting/groups/how-to-manage-groups-and-assign-tasks-in-tallyfy/) in Tallyfy before you can assign a task to it.

#### How do I change the step type?
Different step types behave differently (e.g., Approve/Reject steps have different buttons). See [Step Types Explained](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-types-of-tasks-can-i-create-with-tallyfy/) for details.

<Steps>
1. Click on the step you want to change.
2. Click the **Type** dropdown in the details panel and choose the new type.
</Steps>

#### How do I add or change form fields?
Add fields to collect information during this step.

<Steps>
1. Click on the step.
2. Go to the **Form fields** tab in the details panel.
3. Click **Add field** to add a new one, or click an existing field to edit it.
</Steps>

See [Types of Form Fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) for more details.

#### How do I change deadlines and timings?
Set when the task should be due and when work should start.

<Steps>
1. Click on the step.
2. Go to the **Timings** tab.
3. Set the **deadline** (when work should be complete) relative to:
    - **Process Launch**: Due X time **after** the process starts (default).
    - **Another Step**: Due X time **after** another specific step is completed.
    - **Future Step Completion**: Due X time **before** a *later* step in the process is due to be completed. This is useful for working backward from a final deadline (e.g., "Draft due 3 weeks before Publish Date").

   ![Setting deadline relative to a future step](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-deadline-before-future-step.png)
4. Choose **Start On-Time** or **Start Anytime** to control when work should begin:
    - **Start On-Time**: Suggests a specific start time when work should begin on the task. This provides guidance about when to start working, but doesn't force it.
    - **Start Anytime**: No suggested start time - work can begin at any time (default).
</Steps>

:::note[Understanding start time vs deadline]
**Start time** and **deadline** serve different purposes in task management:

- **Start time**: When work should **begin** on the task. This helps with planning and scheduling but is not enforced.
- **Deadline**: When work should be **complete** on the task. This is the due date that determines if a task becomes overdue.

Both start times and deadlines can be set for tasks within processes (using the template editor) and for one-off tasks (when creating them directly).

Example: A task might have a start time of "Monday 9 AM" (when you should begin working) and a deadline of "Wednesday 5 PM" (when it must be finished).
:::

:::note[Understanding overall process deadlines]
The longest deadline for any given process is determined by the task that's set at the latest deadline relative to the launch date. However, this is not true if you set a deadline relative to completing another step - because you never know when that other step will complete, so that deadline will be unpredictable and set at run-time, dynamic and dependent on the other task's completion state.
:::

#### What are the advanced step settings?
These options offer more control over how the step works.

- **Launch another process when this task is complete**: Set to "Yes" to automatically start another process (from a different template) when this task finishes. You can choose to add the new tasks into the current process or start a completely separate one. See [Launch another process guide](/products/pro/launching/launch-process-when-task-is-completed/).
- **All assignees must complete this task**: If "Yes", the task isn't done until *everyone* assigned has marked it complete.
- **Assign launcher automatically**: If a step has *no* assignees set, turning this ON means the person who starts the process will automatically be assigned. If OFF, it remains unassigned.
- **Task is mandatory...**: If "Yes", this step cannot be removed when someone starts the process.
- **Only assigned members can complete or edit...**: If "Yes", only people directly assigned can work on or complete the task (except Administrators, who can always access it).
- **Emit webhook when completed**: If "Yes", Tallyfy sends an automatic notification to another web service (via a [webhook](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/)) when this task is done.
- **Prevent guests from making or seeing comments**: If "Yes", any [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) assigned won't see or be able to add comments on this task.
- **Unique Step Alias**: An internal ID for this specific step, mostly used for technical integrations via [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) or the [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/).
- **Tags**: Add organizational tags to this step.
