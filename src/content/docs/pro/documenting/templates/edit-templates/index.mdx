## Options for editing templates

You can change your [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in many ways after you create them.

:::note[Who can edit templates?]
[Members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) with the "Light" role **cannot** edit templates. Only "Standard" members (if an Admin gives them permission for a specific template) or "Administrator" members can edit templates.
:::

To start making changes, first open the template in **Edit view**:

1. Go to the **Templates** library.
2. Find the template you want to change.
3. Click the **Edit** icon (the pencil) on the template card.

This opens the **Edit view**, where you can modify steps, descriptions, settings, and more.
