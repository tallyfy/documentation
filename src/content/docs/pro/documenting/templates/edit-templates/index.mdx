## What are my options for editing templates?

To edit a template in Tallyfy, click the **Edit** icon (pencil) on any template card. You'll then access the Edit view where you can modify steps, descriptions, settings - basically everything about your [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).

Simple.

:::note[Who can edit templates?]
[Members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) with the "Light" role **cannot** edit templates. Only "Standard" members (if an Admin gives them permission for a specific template) or "Administrator" members can edit templates.
:::

Here's how to get started:

1. Go to the **Templates** library.
2. Find the template you want to change.
3. Click the **Edit** icon (the pencil) on the template card.

This opens the **Edit view** - your command center for template modifications. You can change steps, tweak descriptions, adjust settings, and much more.
