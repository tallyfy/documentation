## How to change the name of a template

:::note[Changes made won't affect ongoing processes]

Note that any change you make to a template won't affect any ongoing process that depends on it. This ensures the integrity and consistency of processes.

:::

To rename a template, head over to the **Config** button, and then click on your template's name, once you're happy with the changes, click on **"Save"**.

Alternatively, you can rename a template from the **Edit view** by simply clicking the name of your template at the top of the screen and then selecting the **Rename** option
