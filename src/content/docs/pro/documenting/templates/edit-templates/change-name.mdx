## How can I rename a Tallyfy template?

You can rename a template in Tallyfy two ways - either through the Settings menu or by clicking directly on the template name. Both methods take less than 10 seconds.

:::note[Changes only affect future processes]
Changing a template's name in Tallyfy does **not** affect any processes that are already running from the old version of the template. The name change only applies to *new* processes started *after* you rename it.

Here's how to rename your [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/):

**Method 1: Using the Settings/Config Menu**

1. Open the template in Tallyfy's Edit mode.
2. Click the **Settings** (or **Config**) button in the top toolbar.
3. Click on the current template name shown at the top of the settings panel.
4. Type the new name.
5. Click **Save**.

Done.

**Method 2: Directly from the Edit View**

This one's even faster:

1. Open the template in Tallyfy's Edit mode.
2. Click directly on the template's name displayed at the very top of the editor screen.
3. Choose the **Rename** option.
4. Type the new name and save.
