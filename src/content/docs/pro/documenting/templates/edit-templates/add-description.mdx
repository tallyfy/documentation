## How to add a description to a template or step

You can add descriptions to provide more detail about your overall [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) or individual [steps](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) within it.

:::note[Changes only affect future processes]
Remember, changes you make to a template (like adding descriptions) only apply to *new* [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) started *after* you make the change. They don't affect processes already running.
:::

To add or edit a description:

1.  Open the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in **Edit** mode.
2.  How you access the description depends on the template type:
    *   **For the overall Template description**: Click the **Settings** (or **Config**) button in the top toolbar, go to the **Summary** tab, and find the **Description** box.

    *   **For a specific Step description (in Procedure templates)**: Click directly on the [step](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) you want to add a description to. The description box will appear in the panel that opens (usually on the right).
    *   **For Document templates**: The main content area is where you add your description or primary text.
3.  Type your description into the text box.
4.  Changes are usually saved automatically as you type.

:::caution[Pasting content might lose formatting]
If you copy text from other programs (like Word or Google Docs) and paste it into Tallyfy's description boxes or rich text editors, the original formatting (like fonts, colors, complex layouts) might not carry over perfectly. Tallyfy uses its own standard formatting to keep things consistent.
