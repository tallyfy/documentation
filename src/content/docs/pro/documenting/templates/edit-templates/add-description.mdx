## How to add descriptions

Open your [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in **Edit** mode, then click **Settings** (gear icon in the sub-nav bar) for the overall template description - or click directly on any step for step-specific descriptions.

:::note[Changes only affect future processes]
Changes you make to a template (like adding descriptions) only apply to *new* [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) started *after* you save. Already-running processes aren't affected.
:::

1.  Open the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in **Edit** mode.
2.  Where you add the description depends on what you're describing:
    *   **Overall template description**: Click the **Settings** button (gear icon) in the sub-nav bar, then open the **Summary** tab. You'll see a rich text Description box.

    *   **Step description (Procedure templates)**: Click directly on the [step](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) you want to describe. A panel opens on the right with the description editor.
    *   **Document templates**: The main content area is your editing canvas for the primary text.
3.  Type your description into the text box.
4.  For step descriptions, Tallyfy auto-saves as you type. For the template-level description in Settings, click **Save** when you're done.

:::caution[Pasting content might lose formatting]
If you paste text from programs like Word or Google Docs, the original formatting (fonts, colors, complex layouts) might not carry over exactly. Tallyfy uses its own standard formatting for consistency.
