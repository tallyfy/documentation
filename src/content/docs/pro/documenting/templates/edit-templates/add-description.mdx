## How to add descriptions

To add a description in Tallyfy, open your [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in **Edit** mode and either click **Settings** for the overall template description or click directly on any step for step-specific descriptions. Type your description and it saves automatically. That's it.

Need more details? Let's walk through each option.

:::note[Changes only affect future processes]
Remember, changes you make to a template in Tallyfy (like adding descriptions) only apply to *new* [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) started *after* you make the change. They don't affect processes already running.
:::

Here's exactly how to add descriptions:

1.  Open the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in **Edit** mode.
2.  Where you add the description depends on what you're describing:
    *   **For the overall Template description**: Click the **Settings** (or **Config**) button in the top toolbar, head to the **Summary** tab, and you'll see the **Description** box waiting for you.

    *   **For a specific Step description (in Procedure templates)**: Just click directly on the [step](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) you want to describe. The description box appears in the panel that opens - usually on the right side.
    *   **For Document templates**: The main content area is your canvas. That's where your description or primary text goes.
3.  Type your description into the text box.
4.  Tallyfy saves changes automatically as you type - no save button needed.

Simple.

:::caution[Pasting content might lose formatting]
If you copy text from other programs (like Word or Google Docs) and paste it into Tallyfy's description boxes or rich text editors, the original formatting (like fonts, colors, complex layouts) might not carry over perfectly. Tallyfy uses its own standard formatting to keep things consistent.
