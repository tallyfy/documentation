## How step assignments work

Every step in a Tallyfy [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) needs an assignment type. This controls who gets each [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) when someone [launches your process](/products/pro/launching/). The assignment panel offers three modes: **Fixed**, **Dynamic**, and **Guest**.

### Fixed assignment (specific people or groups)

Pick this when you know exactly who should handle a step. Every time.

#### Specific people
- The same person gets this task each time the process runs
- No need to choose assignees at launch - it's already decided
- Great for tasks with clear ownership, like approval from your CFO

*How to:* Click the step > select **Fixed** > type a member's name

#### Groups
Groups work like pre-built teams. Use them when:
- Multiple people could handle the task
- You don't want to list everyone individually
- Your team changes but the group stays constant

*How to:* Click the step > select **Fixed** > type the group name

:::note[Setting up groups]
You need to [create groups](/products/pro/documenting/groups/how-to-manage-groups-and-assign-tasks-in-tallyfy/) in Tallyfy Settings before you can assign tasks to them.

### Dynamic assignment (job titles)

Sometimes you know the *role* that should handle a task - but not which specific person. That's what job titles are for.

:::tip[Job titles = casting roles in a play]
- **Fixed:** Like choosing specific actors beforehand. Same actors every show.
- **Dynamic (Job Title):** Like saying you need a "Lead Actor" but not picking who yet. When the play starts (process launches), you pick who fills the role *for that run*. Different people can fill it each time.

This works well when the person depends on the project or client, but the job function stays the same (e.g., always needs a "Project Manager").
:::

How it works:
- You define a role in your template ("Legal Reviewer", "Project Manager", etc.)
- When someone [launches the process](/products/pro/launching/), they pick who fills that role
- Next run? They can choose someone different.

*How to:* Click the step > select **Dynamic** > choose or create a job title

### Guest assignment

Need someone outside your company to complete a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/)? Guest assignments handle this - for clients, vendors, or contractors who don't have Tallyfy accounts.

*How to:* Click the step > select **Guest** > add their email (or leave blank to decide at launch)

What happens at launch:
- If you set an email in the template, the [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) is assigned automatically
- If you left it blank, you'll enter the email when launching
- Either way, they get an email with a direct link - no login needed

### Automation rules for assignments

[Automation rules](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) let you change who gets a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) based on what happens during the process. For example, if someone selects "Budget over $10K" in a form field, you can route approval to senior management automatically.

Your rules can:
- **Add** extra assignees alongside existing ones
- **Replace** the current assignee with someone else
- **Clear** all assignees and start fresh

See [Automate task assignments](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/actions/asignment-actions/) for the full guide.
