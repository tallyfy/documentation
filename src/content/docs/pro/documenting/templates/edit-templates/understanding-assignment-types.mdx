## Choosing how to assign steps in templates

When you build a process [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in Tallyfy, you decide who should do each [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/). There are several ways to set this up, affecting who gets assigned when someone [starts a process](/products/pro/launching/) from the template.

### Option 1: Assign to Specific People or Groups (Fixed)

Use this when you know exactly who (or which group) should always do this specific task.

#### Assigning to specific people
- The same person always gets this task every time the process runs.
- No need to choose assignees when starting the process.
- Good for tasks with clear, unchanging ownership.

*How to:* Select the step > **Assign** tab > Type and select the member's name.

#### Assigning to groups
A group is a list of people you set up beforehand. Assigning to a group is useful when:
- Several people might do the task.
- You don't want to list individuals.
- Team members change, but the group stays the same.

*How to:* Select the step > **Assign** tab > Type and select the group name.

:::note[Setting up Groups]
You need to [create groups](/products/pro/documenting/groups/how-to-manage-groups-and-assign-tasks-in-tallyfy/) in Settings before you can assign tasks to them.

### Option 2: Assign based on Job Title (Dynamic)

Use this when you know the *type* of role needed for the task, but the specific person might change each time the process runs.

:::tip[Job Titles = Casting Roles in a Play]
- **Fixed Assignment:** Like **choosing specific actors** for roles beforehand. The same actors always play those parts.
- **Job Title Assignment:** Like saying you need a **"Lead Actor"** but not picking who yet. When the play starts (process launches), you **hold auditions** and choose who plays the Lead Actor *for that specific show*. Different actors can play the role on different nights.

This is useful when the person doing the task depends on the project or client, but the *job function* is always the same (e.g., always needs a "Project Manager").
:::

When using job titles:
- You define the role needed in the template (e.g., "Legal Reviewer").
- When someone [starts the process](/products/pro/launching/), Tallyfy asks them to choose the *actual person* who will fill that role for this specific run.
- Different people can be picked for the same job title on different runs of the process.

*How to:* Select the step > **Assign** tab > Choose **Job Title** > Type a clear job title name.

### Option 3: Assign to Guests

Use this to assign [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to people outside your company (clients, vendors, etc.) who don't have a Tallyfy account.

*How to:* Select the step > **Assign** tab > Choose **Guest** > Enter the guest's email address (or leave it blank to fill in when the process starts).

When the process starts:
- If you entered an email in the template, that guest is automatically assigned.
- If you left it blank, the person starting the process will be asked to enter the [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/)'s email address.
- The guest gets an email with a link to their task.

:::note[Guest Email Shortcut]
You can quickly assign a guest by typing `+guest@email.com` in any task comment box.
:::

### Option 4: Use Automation Rules

For the most flexibility, you can set up [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) rules that change who is assigned to a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) based on conditions met during the process (e.g., based on form answers).

These rules can:
- Add assignees.
- Replace assignees.
- Clear assignees.

See [Automate task assignments](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/actions/asignment-actions/) for details.
