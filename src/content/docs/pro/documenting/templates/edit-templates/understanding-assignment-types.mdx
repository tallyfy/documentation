## How do I choose assignment types for template steps?

You need to decide who does what in your Tallyfy [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). There are several ways to assign [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) - and your choice determines who gets work when someone [launches your process](/products/pro/launching/).

### How do I assign to specific people or groups?

This works when you know exactly who should handle a task. Every time.

#### How do I assign to specific people?
- The same person gets this task each time the process runs
- You won't need to choose assignees at launch (it's already decided)
- Perfect for tasks with clear ownership - like approval from your CFO

*How to:* Click the step > **Assign** tab > Type the member's name

#### How do I assign to groups?
Think of groups as pre-built teams. You'll want groups when:
- Multiple people could handle the task
- You'd rather not list everyone individually  
- Your team changes but the group stays constant (new hires automatically get included)

*How to:* Click the step > **Assign** tab > Type the group name

:::note[Setting up Groups]
You need to [create groups](/products/pro/documenting/groups/how-to-manage-groups-and-assign-tasks-in-tallyfy/) in Tallyfy Settings before you can assign tasks to them.

### How do I assign based on job title?

Sometimes you know what role should handle a task - but not which specific person. That's where job titles come in.

:::tip[Job Titles = Casting Roles in a Play]
- **Fixed Assignment:** Like **choosing specific actors** for roles beforehand. The same actors always play those parts.
- **Job Title Assignment:** Like saying you need a **"Lead Actor"** but not picking who yet. When the play starts (process launches), you **hold auditions** and choose who plays the Lead Actor *for that specific show*. Different actors can play the role on different nights.

This is useful when the person doing the task depends on the project or client, but the *job function* is always the same (e.g., always needs a "Project Manager").
:::

Here's how it works:
- You define the role in your template ("Legal Reviewer", "Project Manager", etc.)
- When someone [launches the process](/products/pro/launching/), they pick who fills that role this time
- Next run? They can choose someone else. The flexibility is built in.

*How to:* Click the step > **Assign** tab > Choose **Job Title** > Enter a clear role name

### How do I assign to guests?

Need someone outside your company to complete a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/)? That's what guest assignments are for - clients, vendors, contractors who don't have Tallyfy accounts.

*How to:* Click the step > **Assign** tab > Choose **Guest** > Add their email (or leave blank to decide later)

What happens at launch:
- Got an email in the template? The [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) is assigned automatically
- Left it blank? You'll enter the email when launching
- Either way, they receive an email with a direct link - no login needed

:::note[Guest Email Shortcut]
You can quickly assign a guest by typing `+guest@email.com` in any task comment box.
:::

### How do I use automation rules for assignments?

Want assignments that adapt? [Automation rules](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) let you change who gets a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) based on what happens during the process. If someone selects "Budget over $10K" in a form field, you can automatically route approval to senior management.

Your rules can:
- Add extra assignees
- Switch out the current assignee
- Remove everyone and start fresh

Check out [Automate task assignments](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/actions/asignment-actions/) for the complete guide.
