## Choosing the right assignment type for template steps

When creating [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in Tallyfy, you have multiple ways to assign [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to individuals. The assignment method you choose determines how flexible or fixed the task assignment will be when [launching processes](/products/pro/launching/) from your template.

### Fixed assignments: People and groups

Fixed assignments are used when you already know exactly who needs to complete a specific [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in your [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).

#### Assigning to specific people

When you assign a task to specific people:
- The same individuals will be assigned each time the process is launched
- No additional input is required during process launch
- Fixed assignments provide consistency in task ownership

To assign specific people to a step:
1. Select the step in your template
2. Click the **Assign** tab
3. Type the name of the team member you want to assign
4. Select them from the dropdown menu that appears

#### Assigning to groups

Groups function as collections of people that can be assigned to [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) as a single unit. This is useful when:
- Multiple people need to complete the same task
- You want to avoid assigning individuals one by one
- Team compositions change frequently

To assign a group to a step:
1. Select the step in your template
2. Click the **Assign** tab
3. Type the name of the group
4. Select the group from the dropdown menu

:::note[Group management]
Before assigning groups to tasks, you need to create them in **Settings > Organization > Groups**. For detailed instructions, see [Create and assign groups](/products/pro/documenting/groups/how-to-manage-groups-and-assign-tasks-in-tallyfy/).

### Dynamic assignments: Job titles

Job title assignments provide flexibility when you don't know exactly who will perform a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), but you do know what role or position they hold.

:::tip[Job Titles: Casting Roles in a Play]
Think of assigning tasks like casting actors for a play:

- **Fixed Assignment:** Like **pre-casting specific actors** for roles in the script (template). Every time you stage the play (launch the process), those same actors always play those parts.
- **Job Title Assignment:** Like defining the **roles needed in the script** (e.g., "Lead Actor," "Stage Manager") without choosing the actors yet. When it's time to stage the play (launch the process), you hold **auditions** and select the actual actors (specific members) who will fill each defined role *for that specific performance*. Different actors can play the roles in different shows.

This approach is useful when the person responsible for a task might change depending on the specific project, client, or situation, but the *type* of role needed remains the same.
:::

When you use job titles for assignments:
- You define the role (job title) needed for each task
- During [process launch](/products/pro/launching/), you'll be prompted to select the actual people who will fulfill those roles
- Different people can be assigned to the same job title in different process instances

To set up a job title assignment:
1. Select the step in your template
2. Click the **Assign** tab
3. Select **Job Title** instead of specific people
4. Enter a descriptive job title (e.g., "Legal Reviewer," "Finance Approver," "Project Manager")

When [launching a process](/products/pro/launching/) that uses job title assignments, you'll be prompted to select the actual individuals who will fulfill each job title for that specific process instance.

### Guest assignments

[Guest assignments](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-can-i-assign-tasks-to-guest-users-in-tallyfy/) are used when [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) need to be completed by people outside your organization.

When you assign tasks to guests:
1. Select the step in your template
2. Click the **Assign** tab
3. Select **Guest** as the assignment type
4. Enter the guest's email address or leave it blank to specify during launch

When a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) with guest assignments is launched:
- If the guest email was specified in the template, they will be automatically assigned
- If left blank, you'll be prompted to enter the [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/)'s email during launch
- Guests receive email notifications with links to access their assigned [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/)

:::note[Guest email shortcut]
In any comment field, you can use the format `+guest@email.com` to automatically assign that guest to the [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/). This works in both templates and active processes.
:::

### Assignment automations

For more dynamic assignment needs, Tallyfy offers assignment [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) that can change [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) ownership based on conditions within your process.

With assignment actions, you can:
- Add new assignees based on [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) values
- Replace existing assignees when certain conditions are met
- Clear all assignees from a task

For detailed information on setting up these [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/), see [Automate task assignments](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/actions/asignment-actions/).
