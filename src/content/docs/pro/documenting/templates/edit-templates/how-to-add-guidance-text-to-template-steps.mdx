## How to add guidance text to a step in a template

Tallyfy allows you to add optional descriptions, instructions, or examples that appear under each [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) in a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/). This feature provides directions to your team when filling out form fields.

To add guidance text:

<Steps>
1. Open the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) [step](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) you want to add guidance text to.
2. Go to the [**forms** tab](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/).
3. Select the [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) you wish to add guidance text to.
4. Click on the **Advanced** section.
5. Type in your guidance text.
6. Save your changes.
</Steps>

When the [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) starts, the [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) will display the guidance text in italics under the [form field title](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/). Any URLs included in the guidance text will be clickable, allowing [team members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) to access additional resources.
