## How to add guidance text below a form field

You can add extra instructions or examples that appear directly below a [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) in a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/). This "guidance text" helps clarify what information is needed or provides helpful hints.

To add guidance text to a specific form field:

<Steps>
1. Open the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in **Edit** mode.
2. Click on the [step](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) containing the form field you want to add guidance to.
3. In the step details panel (usually on the right), go to the [**Form Fields** tab](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/).
4. Click on the specific [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to open its settings.
5. Click to expand the **Advanced** section within the field settings.
6. Type your instructions or hints into the **Guidance text** box.
7. Your changes should save automatically.
</Steps>

When someone works on this [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in a running [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), the guidance text will show up in italics directly below the field label. If you include website links (URLs) in the guidance text, they will be clickable, allowing people to easily access extra resources.
