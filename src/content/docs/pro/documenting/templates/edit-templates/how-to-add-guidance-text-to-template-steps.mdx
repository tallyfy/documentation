## Adding guidance text to form fields

You can add extra instructions or examples that appear directly below a [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) in a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/). This "guidance text" helps clarify what information is needed or provides helpful hints.

Adding guidance text to a form field:

<Steps>
1. Open the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in **Edit** mode.
2. Click on the [step](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) containing the form field you want to add guidance to.
3. In the step details panel (usually on the right), go to the [**Form Fields** tab](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/).
4. Click on the specific [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to open its settings.
5. Click to expand the **Advanced** section within the field settings.
6. Type your instructions or hints into the **Guidance text** box.
7. Your changes should save automatically.
</Steps>

During process execution, guidance text appears in italics below the field label. Website links (URLs) in guidance text become clickable, giving people easy access to additional resources.
