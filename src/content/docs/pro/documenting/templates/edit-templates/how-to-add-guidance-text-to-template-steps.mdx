## Adding guidance text to form fields

Want to help users fill out forms correctly? Add guidance text directly below any [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) in Tallyfy - it shows up as helpful instructions right where people need them. This makes a huge difference when you're asking for specific formats or examples.

Here's how to add guidance text to a form field:

<Steps>
1. Open the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in **Edit** mode.
2. Click on the [step](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) containing the form field you want to add guidance to.
3. In the step details panel (usually on the right), go to the [**Form Fields** tab](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/).
4. Click on the specific [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to open its settings.
5. Click to expand the **Advanced** section within the field settings.
6. Type your instructions or hints into the **Guidance text** box.
7. Tallyfy saves your changes automatically.
</Steps>

When someone's working through the process, your guidance text shows up in italics right below the field label. Pretty handy. If you include any web links (URLs) in your guidance text, they'll automatically become clickable - perfect for pointing people to additional resources or examples.
