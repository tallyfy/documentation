## Adding guidance text to form fields

Guidance text appears directly below a [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) label in Tallyfy, giving people instructions right where they need them. It's great for specifying formats, examples, or links to extra resources.

<Steps>
1. Open the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in **Edit** mode.
2. Click the [step](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) that contains the form field.
3. Go to the [**Form Fields** tab](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) in the step details panel.
4. Click the form field to expand its settings.
5. Expand the **More Settings** section.
6. Enter your instructions in the **Guidance Text** field. This is a rich-text editor, so you can format text and add links.
7. Changes save automatically.
</Steps>

When someone runs the process, your guidance text appears in italics below the field label. Any URLs you include become clickable automatically.
