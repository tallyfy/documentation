## How to assign steps in Tallyfy templates

Click the **Assign** tab for any step and pick who should handle it - specific members, groups, job titles[^2], or even guests. You can also leave steps unassigned or let automation rules handle the assignments dynamically.

Here's the thing: assignments determine who gets each task when someone launches your process. Tallyfy gives you multiple ways to handle this - you can lock in specific people or keep things flexible with role-based assignments. Whatever works for your team.

### Prerequisites for assigning steps

You'll need a few things before you can start assigning steps:
- Administrator or Standard member role (Light members[^1] can't edit templates)
- Access to the template you want to edit
- [Groups created](/products/pro/documenting/groups/how-to-manage-groups-and-assign-tasks-in-tallyfy/) if you're planning group assignments
- Guest email addresses ready for external assignments

## Step-by-step assignment process

<Steps>
1. **Open your template in edit mode**
   
   Navigate to the **Templates** tab and click the pencil icon on your template.

## Assignment methods explained

### Assign to specific members

Want the same person to handle a task every single time? This is your option. Once you set it, that's it - no need to pick someone during launch.

**When to use**: Tasks with clear ownership like "HR Manager reviews application" or "Finance Director approves budget"

**How to assign**: Just type and select the member's name from the dropdown. Done.

### Assign to groups

Groups let multiple people share responsibility for a task. Any group member can jump in and complete it - perfect for spreading the workload while keeping everyone accountable.

**When to use**: 
- Support tickets that any team member can handle
- Document reviews where any QA person can take a look
- Approvals where any manager can sign off

**How to assign**: Type the group name and select it from the dropdown. Quick note: groups need to be [created in Settings](/products/pro/documenting/groups/how-to-manage-groups-and-assign-tasks-in-tallyfy/) first before they'll show up here.

### Assign by job title

Job titles are like casting roles in a play - you define what role you need, but pick the specific person later. It's brilliant for flexible workflows.

**When to use**:
- Different people handle the same role depending on the project
- You rotate responsibilities based on who's available
- The same template works across departments with similar roles

**How to assign**: 
1. Pick **Job Title** from the assignment dropdown
2. Enter something descriptive like "Project Manager" or "Quality Reviewer"
3. When someone launches the process, they'll choose who fills that role

**Real-world example**: Your client onboarding needs an "Account Manager" - but which one? Depends on the client, right? With job titles, whoever launches the process picks the right person for that specific client. Simple.

### Assign to guests

Need someone outside your company to complete a task? That's what [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) are for. They get an email with a secure link - no Tallyfy account needed. Easy for them, secure for you.

**When to use**:
- Getting client approvals or feedback
- Collecting documents from vendors
- Having contractors complete specific tasks

**How to assign**: 
- Know the email already? Enter it directly
- Not sure who yet? Leave it blank and let the process launcher decide
- Quick tip: type `+guest@email.com` in any task comment for instant guest assignment

### Leave unassigned ("Nobody right now")

Sometimes you don't want to lock in who does what. Fair enough. Leaving tasks unassigned gives you options.

**What happens**:
- "Assign launcher automatically" is ON? The person who launches the process gets it
- "Assign launcher automatically" is OFF? Task sits there until someone claims it

**When to use**:
- Ad-hoc tasks where you'll figure out assignment based on workload
- Tasks where anyone can volunteer
- Processes where whoever starts it should handle the first few steps

:::caution[Important: Group assignments with automatic launcher assignment]
When a step is assigned to a group AND "Assign launcher automatically" is enabled, the process launcher will be added as an additional assignee alongside the group. This means both the group members AND the launcher can see and complete the task. To avoid this behavior, either:
- Turn OFF "Assign launcher automatically" in the Advanced tab
- Use specific member assignments instead of groups
- Use automation rules to control assignments dynamically
:::

## Advanced assignment techniques

### Dynamic assignment with automation

Here's where it gets interesting. [Automation rules](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) let you change assignments on the fly based on what's happening in your process.

**What you can do**:
- Add assignees based on form answers (someone picks "High Priority"? Auto-assign your senior team)
- Replace assignees when things change
- Clear assignments completely to create unassigned tasks
- Route tasks based on amounts, regions, priorities - whatever you need

**Example**: Purchase request comes in. Over $10,000? Goes straight to the CFO. Under that? Department manager handles it. No manual routing needed.

### Multiple assignee requirements

Need everyone to sign off on something? Here's how:

1. Assign multiple people or groups to the same step
2. Turn on "All assignees must complete this task" in Advanced settings
3. The task waits until everyone marks it done

**Perfect for**:
- Board approvals where everyone needs to vote
- Multi-department sign-offs
- Reviews that need multiple perspectives

### Assignment best practices

**Be specific with job titles**: "Senior Marketing Manager" beats just "Manager" every time. Trust me - you'll avoid confusion when launching.

**Think about workload**: Groups spread tasks naturally. Specific assignments? Great for accountability, but watch out for overloading your star performers.

**Plan for vacations**: People take time off (shocking, I know). Groups and job titles give you built-in backup when someone's out.

**Document your thinking**: Add a quick note in the step description about why you chose that assignment method. Future you will thank present you.

**Test it out**: Launch a few test processes. See how assignments flow in real scenarios. Better to catch issues now than later.

## Troubleshooting assignment issues

### "I can't see a group in the assignment dropdown"

Missing group? It needs to exist first. Head to **Settings** > **Groups** and create it there. (Note: only administrators can create groups.)

### "The wrong person got assigned"

Let's check a few things:
- Is "Assign launcher automatically" turned on? That might be overriding your setup
- Got any automation rules running? They could be switching assignments
- Using job titles? Remember, someone needs to pick the actual person during launch

### "Guests aren't receiving task notifications"

Quick checklist:
- Double-check that email address (typos happen)
- Ask them to check spam folders
- Make sure "Prevent guests from making or seeing comments" isn't blocking what they need to see

### "Multiple people need different parts of one task"

Here's a thought: split it up. Create separate steps with their own assignments instead of cramming everything into one task. Works much better.

## Assignment impact on process flow

Your assignment choices shape how work flows through your team:

**Speed**: Specific assignments? Tasks start instantly. Groups? Might sit a bit while someone claims them.

**Flexibility**: Job titles adapt to each situation but need input during launch. Worth it for the flexibility though.

**Accountability**: Named assignments = clear ownership. Group assignments = shared responsibility. Both have their place.

**Scalability**: Here's the thing - groups and job titles grow with your team. Specific assignments? You'll be updating them forever as people come and go.

Bottom line: pick what works for your team's style. Mix and match different methods across your template. There's no one-size-fits-all approach here.
