## How to assign steps in Tallyfy templates

Click the **Assign** tab for any step to pick who handles it - specific members, groups, job titles[^2], or guests. You can also leave steps unassigned or let automation rules route assignments dynamically.

Assignments determine who gets each task when someone launches your process. You can lock in specific people or keep things flexible with role-based assignments.

### Prerequisites

- Admin or Standard member role (Light members[^1] can't edit templates)
- Access to the template you want to edit
- [Groups created](/products/pro/documenting/groups/how-to-manage-groups-and-assign-tasks-in-tallyfy/) if you're planning group assignments
- Guest email addresses ready for external assignments

## Step-by-step assignment process

<Steps>
1. **Open your template in edit mode**

   Go to the **Templates** tab and click the pencil icon on your template.

3. **Open the Assign tab**

   Click the **Assign** tab in the step details panel.

   Pick from the available assignment types described below.
</Steps>

## Assignment methods

### Specific members

Assigns the same person every time. No need to pick someone during launch.

**When to use**: Tasks with clear ownership like "HR Manager reviews application" or "Finance Director approves budget."

**How**: Type and select the member's name from the dropdown.

### Groups

Groups let multiple people share responsibility. Any group member can complete the task.

**When to use**:
- Support tickets any team member can handle
- Document reviews where any QA person can take a look
- Approvals where any manager can sign off

**How**: Type the group name and select it. Groups must be [created in Settings](/products/pro/documenting/groups/how-to-manage-groups-and-assign-tasks-in-tallyfy/) first.

### Job titles

Job titles[^2] let you define what role you need, then pick the specific person later. Great for flexible workflows.

**When to use**:
- Different people handle the same role depending on the project
- You rotate responsibilities based on availability
- The same template works across departments with similar roles

**How**:
1. Pick **Job Title** from the assignment dropdown
2. Enter something descriptive like "Project Manager" or "Quality Reviewer"
3. When someone launches the process, they'll choose who fills that role

**Example**: Your client onboarding needs an "Account Manager" - but which one depends on the client. With job titles, whoever launches the process picks the right person.

### Guests

[Guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) are people outside your company. They get an email with a secure link - no Tallyfy account needed.

**When to use**:
- Getting client approvals or feedback
- Collecting documents from vendors
- Having contractors complete specific tasks

**How**:
- Know the email? Enter it directly in the assignment dropdown
- Not sure who yet? Leave it blank and let the process launcher decide

### Unassigned steps

Leaving steps unassigned gives you flexibility:

- **"Assign launcher automatically" ON** - the person who launches the process gets the task
- **"Assign launcher automatically" OFF** - the task stays unassigned until someone claims it

**When to use**:
- Ad-hoc tasks where assignment depends on workload
- Tasks where anyone can volunteer
- Processes where the launcher should handle initial steps

:::caution[Important: Group assignments with automatic launcher assignment]
When a step is assigned to a group AND "Assign launcher automatically" is enabled, the process launcher will be added as an additional assignee alongside the group. This means both the group members AND the launcher can see and complete the task. To avoid this behavior, either:
- Turn OFF "Assign launcher automatically" for that step
- Use specific member assignments instead of groups
- Use automation rules to control assignments dynamically
:::

## Advanced techniques

### Dynamic assignment with automation

[Automation rules](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) can change assignments based on what's happening in your process:

- Add assignees based on form answers (someone picks "High Priority"? Auto-assign your senior team)
- Replace assignees when conditions change
- Clear assignments to create unassigned tasks
- Route tasks based on amounts, regions, or priorities

**Example**: Purchase request over $10,000? Goes to the CFO. Under that? Department manager handles it. No manual routing needed.

### Requiring all assignees to complete

Need everyone to sign off? Here's how:

1. Assign multiple people or groups to the same step
2. Turn on "All assignees must complete this task" (the `everyone_must_complete` setting)
3. The task waits until every assignee marks it done

Good for board approvals, multi-department sign-offs, and reviews needing multiple perspectives.

### Tips

- **Be specific with job titles** - "Senior Marketing Manager" beats "Manager." You'll avoid confusion at launch time.
- **Groups spread workload** - specific assignments are great for accountability, but watch for overloading one person.
- **Plan for absences** - groups and job titles give you built-in backup when someone's out.
- **Test first** - launch a few test processes to see how assignments flow in practice.

## Troubleshooting

### "I can't see a group in the assignment dropdown"

The group needs to exist first. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Groups** to create it. Only admins can create groups, and the "Allow group management" org setting must be enabled.

### "The wrong person got assigned"

Check these:
- Is "Assign launcher automatically" turned on? It may be overriding your setup.
- Are any automation rules switching assignments?
- Using job titles? Someone needs to pick the actual person during launch.

### "Guests aren't receiving task notifications"

- Double-check the email address for typos
- Ask them to check spam folders
- Verify that "Prevent guests from making or seeing comments" (`prevent_guest_comment`) isn't blocking what they need

### "Multiple people need different parts of one task"

Split the task into separate steps, each with its own assignments.
