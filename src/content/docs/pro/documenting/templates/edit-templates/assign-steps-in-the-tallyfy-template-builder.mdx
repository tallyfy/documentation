## How to assign steps in Tallyfy templates

To assign steps in Tallyfy, click the **Assign** tab for any step and choose from specific members, groups, job titles, or guests. You can also leave steps unassigned or use automation rules for dynamic assignment based on process conditions.

Assignment determines who receives and completes each task when someone launches a process from your template. Tallyfy offers multiple assignment methods to match your workflow needs - from fixed assignments to flexible role-based options.

### Prerequisites for assigning steps

Before assigning steps in your templates, ensure you have:
- Administrator or Standard member role (Light members cannot edit templates)
- Access to the template you want to edit
- [Groups created](/products/pro/documenting/groups/how-to-manage-groups-and-assign-tasks-in-tallyfy/) if planning group assignments
- Guest email addresses ready for external assignments

## Step-by-step assignment process

<Steps>
1. **Open your template in edit mode**
   
   Navigate to the **Templates** tab and click the pencil icon on your template.

## Assignment methods explained

### Assign to specific members

Use this when the same person should always complete this task across all process runs. The assignment remains fixed - no selection needed during process launch.

**When to use**: Tasks with clear ownership like "HR Manager reviews application" or "Finance Director approves budget"

**How to assign**: Type and select the member's name from the dropdown list.

### Assign to groups

Groups let multiple people share responsibility for a task. Any group member can claim and complete the task, providing flexibility while maintaining accountability.

**When to use**: 
- Support ticket handling by any support team member
- Document reviews by any quality assurance team member
- Approval tasks where any manager can sign off

**How to assign**: Type and select the group name from the dropdown. Groups must be [created in Settings](/products/pro/documenting/groups/how-to-manage-groups-and-assign-tasks-in-tallyfy/) before they appear here.

### Assign by job title

Job titles create placeholder roles that get filled when someone launches the process. Think of it like casting roles in a play - you define the role needed, but choose the specific actor later.

**When to use**:
- Project-specific assignments where the person changes per client
- Rotating responsibilities based on availability
- Templates used across different departments with similar roles

**How to assign**: 
1. Select **Job Title** from the assignment type dropdown
2. Enter a descriptive job title like "Project Manager" or "Quality Reviewer"
3. The process launcher will select the actual person during launch

**Example scenario**: A client onboarding template needs an "Account Manager" - but which specific account manager depends on the client. Using job titles, the process launcher picks the right person for each new client.

### Assign to guests

[Guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) are people outside your organization who need to complete specific tasks. They receive email notifications with secure links to access only their assigned tasks - no Tallyfy account needed.

**When to use**:
- Client approvals or feedback collection
- Vendor document submissions
- External contractor task assignments

**How to assign**: 
- Enter the guest's email directly for fixed assignment
- Leave blank to let the process launcher enter the email during launch
- Type `+guest@email.com` in any task comment for quick guest assignment

### Leave unassigned ("Nobody right now")

Sometimes you want flexibility in who handles a task. Leaving it unassigned creates different behaviors based on your settings.

**What happens**:
- If "Assign launcher automatically" is ON: The process launcher gets assigned
- If "Assign launcher automatically" is OFF: Task remains unassigned until someone claims it

**When to use**:
- Ad-hoc tasks where assignment depends on workload
- Tasks anyone can volunteer to complete
- Processes where the launcher should handle initial steps

## Advanced assignment techniques

### Dynamic assignment with automation

[Automation rules](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) provide the most flexibility by changing assignments based on process data or conditions.

**Capabilities**:
- Add assignees based on form field answers
- Replace assignees when conditions change
- Clear assignments to create unassigned tasks
- Route tasks based on dollar amounts, regions, or priorities

**Example**: A purchase request over $10,000 automatically assigns the CFO for approval, while smaller amounts go to department managers.

### Multiple assignee requirements

For tasks requiring multiple approvals or parallel work:

1. Assign multiple people or groups to the same step
2. Enable "All assignees must complete this task" in Advanced settings
3. Task only completes when everyone marks it done

**Common uses**:
- Board approvals requiring all members
- Multi-department sign-offs
- Parallel review processes

### Assignment best practices

**Be specific with job titles**: Use "Senior Marketing Manager" instead of just "Manager" to avoid confusion during process launch.

**Consider workload distribution**: Groups spread tasks among team members, while specific assignments might overload individuals.

**Plan for absences**: Groups and job titles provide backup options when specific people are unavailable.

**Document assignment logic**: Add notes in step descriptions explaining why certain assignment methods were chosen.

**Test different scenarios**: Launch test processes to verify assignments work correctly across various situations.

## Troubleshooting assignment issues

### "I can't see a group in the assignment dropdown"

Groups must be created in **Settings** > **Groups** before they appear in assignment options. Only administrators can create groups.

### "The wrong person got assigned"

Check these settings:
- "Assign launcher automatically" might be overriding your assignment
- Automation rules may be changing assignments
- Job titles need specific person selection during launch

### "Guests aren't receiving task notifications"

Verify:
- Email address is entered correctly
- Guest email isn't blocked by spam filters
- "Prevent guests from making or seeing comments" isn't blocking necessary access

### "Multiple people need different parts of one task"

Consider splitting into separate steps with individual assignments rather than using one step with multiple assignees.

## Assignment impact on process flow

Your assignment choices affect how processes run:

**Speed**: Specific assignments start immediately, while groups may have claim delays.

**Flexibility**: Job titles adapt to each process instance but require launcher input.

**Accountability**: Named assignments create clear ownership versus shared group responsibility.

**Scalability**: Groups and job titles scale better than specific person assignments as teams grow.

Choose assignment methods that balance efficiency with your team's working style and process requirements.
