### What is the status of a template?

The template status helps your team know if a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) is still being worked on or if it's finished and ready to use.

There are 4 statuses you can choose:

- **Started**: Just beginning to create the template.
- **In progress**: Currently being worked on, maybe by several people.
- **Finishing**: Almost done, perhaps under final review.
- **Published**: Complete and ready for people to launch processes from it.

:::note[Who can change the status?]
Changing a template's status is a bit different from editing its content:

- **Administrators**: Can change the status from anywhere (either the main Templates library list or within the Template Editor settings).
- **Standard members**: Can always change the status from the main Templates library list. They can *also* change it in the Template Editor settings *if* they have permission to edit that specific template.
- **Light members**: Cannot edit templates, but they *can* still change the status of a template from the main Templates library list.

### How to change a template's status

You can change the status in two places:

**Method 1: From the main Templates Library**
<Steps>
1.  Go to the **Templates** section in the left sidebar.
2.  Find the template you want to update in the list.
3.  Click the current status shown next to the template's name (e.g., click where it says "Published").
4.  Choose the new status from the dropdown menu that appears.
