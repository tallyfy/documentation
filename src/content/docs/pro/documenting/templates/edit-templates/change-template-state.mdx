### Understanding template status

Want to let your team know whether a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) is ready to use? That's what template status is for - it shows if you're still building it or if it's good to go.

Tallyfy gives you 4 status options:

- **Started**: Just beginning to create the template.
- **In progress**: Currently being worked on, maybe by several people.
- **Finishing**: Almost done, perhaps under final review.
- **Published**: Complete and ready for people to launch processes from it.

:::note[Who can change the status?]
Here's where it gets interesting - changing a template's status works differently than editing its content:

- **Administrators**: Can change the status from anywhere (the main Templates list or within the Template Editor settings).
- **Standard members**: Can always change the status from the main Templates list. They can *also* change it in the Template Editor settings *if* they have permission to edit that specific template.
- **Light members**: Can't edit templates, but they *can* still change the status of a template from the main Templates list. (Yes, really!)

### Changing template status

You've got two ways to change a template's status:

**Method 1: From the main Templates section**
<Steps>
1.  Head to the **Templates** section in Tallyfy's left sidebar.
2.  Find the template you want to update in the list.
3.  Click the current status shown next to the template's name (for example, where it says "Published").
4.  Pick your new status from the dropdown menu. Done!

</Steps>

**Method 2: From the Template Editor (Admins/Standard members with edit rights only)**
<Steps>
1.  Open the template in **Edit** mode - just click the pencil icon.
2.  Click the **Settings** (or **Config**) button in the top toolbar.
3.  Switch to the **Summary** tab.
4.  Find the **Status** dropdown menu and select what you need.
5.  Click **Save Changes** if you see the button (sometimes Tallyfy saves it automatically for you).
