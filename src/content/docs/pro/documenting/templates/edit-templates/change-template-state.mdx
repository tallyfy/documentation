### What template status means

A [template's](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) status tells your team whether it's still being built or ready to use. Tallyfy has 4 status options:

- **Started** - Just beginning to create the template (this is the default for new templates).
- **In progress** - Currently being worked on.
- **Finishing** - Almost done, possibly under final review.
- **Published** - Complete and ready to launch processes from.

:::note[Who can change the status?]
Status permissions work differently from editing permissions:

- **Administrators** - Can change status from the Templates list or from within the Template Editor settings.
- **Standard members** - Can always change status from the Templates list. They can also change it in the Template Editor settings if they have edit permission for that template.
- **Light members** - Can't edit templates, but they can still change status from the Templates list.
