### What is the status of a template?

When you create a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) - it takes you time to finish or finalize it. The status tracker of a template let's you make it obvious to coworkers whether the template is just beginning to get created or ready for everyone to use.

Theres 4 different statuses you can assign to a template:

- **Started** - a template that just started being created.
- **In progress** - a template being worked on by a team.
- **Finishing** - a template that is almost complete.
- **Published** - a template that is ready to be used.

:::note[Note on who can modifying the state of a template]

Any [role](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-do-i-manage-member-permissions-in-tallyfy/) is allowed to change a template's status in the following way:

- **Administrator** roles can edit the status in both the library of  _Templates_ and _Template Editor_ > _Settings_.
- **Standard** [roles](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-do-i-manage-member-permissions-in-tallyfy/) can edit both by default but if edit permission fir the template is restricted, a standard role can only modify it in the library of _Templates_.
- **Light** [roles](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-do-i-manage-member-permissions-in-tallyfy/) do not have edit permissions for templates but can still modify the status of the template in the library of _Templates_ too.
