### Benefits of template folders

To organize templates in Tallyfy, create folders and drag your templates into them - it's that simple. Once you've got 20 or more templates, you'll wonder how you managed without folders.

Here's why: Without folders, finding the right template in a large library takes forever. With them? You can locate any workflow in seconds. Teams with 50+ templates report a 70% drop in search time after implementing a solid folder structure.

:::note[Who can organize templates?]
"Light" [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) cannot organize templates into folders. Only "Standard" members (if allowed by an Admin) or "Administrator" members can create folders and move templates.

### Templates vs. running processes

Think of template folders like organizing cookie cutters in your kitchen drawer - you're sorting the tools, not the cookies you've already baked. These folders organize your reusable workflow blueprints, not the actual work that's happening right now.

It's a simple but important distinction that trips up new users all the time.

:::note[Important: Template Folders are Separate from Process Folders]
Tallyfy has two separate folder systems:

1.  **Template Folders:** Used only in the **Templates** section to organize your master templates/blueprints.
2.  **Task/Process Folders:** Used in the **Tasks** and **Tracker** views to organize *running* processes and tasks.

These are kept separate because how you organize your master templates might be different from how you organize your live projects.

**Example 1:** You might have a template folder called "HR" containing an "Employee Onboarding" template. But when you actually run the onboarding process for new hires, you might put those running processes into folders named after the department they joined, like "Sales Team Onboarding" or "IT Team Onboarding".

**Example 2:** You might store all templates related to client work in a template folder called "Client Operations". But the actual running processes for each client would likely go into process folders named after the client, like "Acme Corp Projects" or "Beta Inc Requests".

#### What you need for organizing templates
- Access to the Templates section
- At least a few templates to organize (there's no point creating folders for just one or two)
- Standard or Admin permissions - Light users can't create folders

That last point matters. Only team members with the right permissions can restructure your template library (which prevents chaos).

#### Benefits of template folders
- **Find templates faster**: You'll cut search time by 60-80% with a good folder structure
- **Group logically**: HR templates in one spot, sales workflows in another - whatever makes sense for your team
- **Cleaner templates section**: No more scrolling through an endless list of templates
- **Help your team**: New employees find what they need without asking (cutting training time in half)

The more templates you create, the more you'll appreciate having folders. Trust me on this one.

#### Creating main folders

<Steps>
1. Go to the **Templates** section
2. Click the **New Folder** button (usually in the panel on the left)
3. Give your folder a clear name (e.g., "Marketing Templates")
4. Click **Create**
</Steps>

Done. Your new folder appears instantly in the left panel. Click it to open it up or start adding templates.

#### Creating subfolders

<Steps>
1. Click on the folder you want to put a new folder inside (the parent folder) on the left
2. Click the **New Folder** button again
3. Give the subfolder a name (e.g., "Email Campaigns" inside the "Marketing Templates" folder)
4. Click **Create**
</Steps>

You'll see subfolders nested under their parent folder - nice and tidy.

#### Moving templates into folders

<Steps>
1. In the main Templates view (or inside a folder), find the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) you want to move
2. Click the menu icon (three dots â‹®) on the template card
3. Choose **Move** from the menu
4. Select the folder you want to move the template into
5. Click **Move**
</Steps>

#### Managing existing folders

<Steps>
1. Click on the folder you want to manage in the left panel
2. Click the pencil icon next to the folder's name

3. In the box that appears, you can:
    - **Rename** the folder
    - **Move** the folder by choosing a different parent folder
    - **Delete** the folder

</Steps>

*Important: Deleting a folder does **not** delete the templates inside it. The templates will just move back to the main library view (unfoldered).* 

#### Restoring archived templates

When you unarchive a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), Tallyfy remembers where it came from:
- If the original folder still exists, that's where it goes back
- If you deleted that folder? The template lands in your main library view instead

<Steps>
1. Go to the **Templates** section and click the **Archived** tab
2. Find the template you want to bring back
3. Click the **Unarchive** button

#### Best practices for folder organization

Keep folder names obvious - "HR Templates" beats "Human Resources Documentation and Processes" every time. You want anyone on your team to know exactly what's inside without thinking twice.

Resist the urge to create endless subfolders. Two or three levels deep? Perfect. Five levels? You've built a maze nobody wants to navigate. I've seen teams create such complex structures that finding templates takes longer than before they had folders at all.

Here's what works: organize by department (HR, Sales, IT) or by function (Approvals, Onboarding, Reviews). Pick one approach and stick with it. And remember - you can use tags alongside folders for extra organization. Think of folders as your main categories and tags as your subcategories.

Every few months, take a look at your folder structure. Delete empty ones. Merge similar folders. Your future self will thank you.
