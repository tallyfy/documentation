### Why use template folders?

Create folders in Tallyfy and move your templates into them. Once you've got 20+ templates, folders make finding the right workflow much faster.

:::note[Who can organize templates?]
"Light" [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) can't organize templates into folders. Only "Standard" members (if allowed by an Admin) or "Administrator" members can create folders and move templates.

### Template folders vs. process folders

Tallyfy has two separate folder systems. They're independent of each other.

:::note[Template folders are separate from process folders]
1.  **Template folders** - used only in the **Templates** section to organize your master blueprints.
2.  **Task/process folders** - used in the **Tasks** and **Tracker** views to organize *running* processes and tasks.

How you organize master templates often differs from how you organize live work.

**Example 1:** A template folder called "HR" might contain "Employee Onboarding." But running onboarding processes go into folders named by department - "Sales Team Onboarding" or "IT Team Onboarding."

**Example 2:** All client templates live in "Client Operations." But running processes go into folders named per client - "Acme Corp Projects" or "Beta Inc Requests."

#### What you need
- Access to the **Templates** section
- Standard or Admin permissions - Light members can't create folders

#### Benefits
- **Find templates faster** - good folder structure cuts search time
- **Group logically** - HR templates in one spot, sales workflows in another
- **Cleaner view** - no more scrolling through an endless flat list
- **Self-service** - new employees find what they need without asking

#### Creating main folders

<Steps>
1. Go to the **Templates** section
2. Click the **New Folder** button in the left panel
3. Name your folder (max 32 characters, e.g., "Marketing Templates")
4. Click **Create**
</Steps>

Your new folder appears in the left panel. Click it to open or start adding templates.

#### Creating subfolders

<Steps>
1. Click a parent folder in the left panel
2. Click **New Folder** again
3. Name the subfolder (e.g., "Email Campaigns" inside "Marketing Templates")
4. Click **Create**
</Steps>

Subfolders nest under their parent folder.

#### Moving templates into folders

<Steps>
1. Find the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) you want to move
2. Click the menu icon (three dots) on the template card
3. Choose **Move** from the menu
4. Select the destination folder
5. Click **Move**
</Steps>

#### Managing existing folders

<Steps>
1. Click the folder you want to manage in the left panel
2. Click the pencil icon next to the folder's name

3. From here you can:
    - **Rename** the folder
    - **Move** it to a different parent folder
    - **Delete** the folder

</Steps>

*Deleting a folder does **not** delete the templates inside it. They move back to the main library view (unfoldered).*

#### Restoring archived templates

When you unarchive a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), Tallyfy remembers its original folder:
- If the folder still exists, the template goes back there
- If the folder was deleted, the template lands in the main library view

<Steps>
1. Go to **Templates** and click the **Archived** tab
2. Find the template you want to restore
3. Click **Unarchive**

</Steps>

#### Best practices

Keep folder names short and obvious - "HR Templates" beats "Human Resources Documentation and Processes." Two or three levels of nesting works well. More than that creates a maze.

Organize by department (HR, Sales, IT) or by function (Approvals, Onboarding, Reviews). Pick one approach and stick with it. You can also use tags alongside folders for extra categorization.

Review your folder structure every few months. Delete empty folders and merge similar ones.
