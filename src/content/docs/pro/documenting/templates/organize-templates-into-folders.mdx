### Why should I use template folders for organization?

Template folders help you organize your library of templates efficiently. Putting related templates into folders makes it easier to find and manage them, especially if you have many templates across different departments or functions.

This organizational approach becomes increasingly valuable as your template library grows and more team members need to locate specific workflow blueprints.

:::note[Who can organize templates?]
"Light" [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) cannot organize templates into folders. Only "Standard" members (if allowed by an Admin) or "Administrator" members can create folders and move templates.

### How does organizing templates differ from organizing running processes?

Folders help you structure your template library so you can find the right blueprint when you need it. This organizational structure focuses on categorizing reusable workflow patterns rather than active work instances.

The key difference is that template organization is about blueprint management, while process organization is about active work tracking.

:::note[Important: Template Folders are Separate from Process Folders]
Tallyfy has two separate folder systems:

1.  **Template Folders:** Used only in the **Templates** library section to organize your master templates/blueprints.
2.  **Task/Process Folders:** Used in the **Tasks** and **Tracker** views to organize *running* processes and tasks.

These are kept separate because how you organize your master templates might be different from how you organize your live projects.

**Example 1:** You might have a template folder called "HR" containing an "Employee Onboarding" template. But when you actually run the onboarding process for new hires, you might put those running processes into folders named after the department they joined, like "Sales Team Onboarding" or "IT Team Onboarding".

**Example 2:** You might store all templates related to client work in a template folder called "Client Operations". But the actual running processes for each client would likely go into process folders named after the client, like "Acme Corp Projects" or "Beta Inc Requests".
:::

#### What prerequisites are needed to organize templates effectively?
- Access to the Templates section in the library for folder management.
- Templates that you want to put into folders for better organization.
- Permission to create folders and move templates (Standard or Admin role required).

These requirements ensure that only authorized users can restructure the template library while maintaining proper access controls.

#### What benefits do template folders provide for workflow management?
- **Find templates faster**: A clear structure makes locating templates easier, reducing time spent searching.
- **Group logically**: Put templates together by department (HR, Sales), function (Approvals, Requests), or type for intuitive navigation.
- **Cleaner library**: Keeps your main template list tidy and reduces visual clutter in the interface.
- **Help your team**: Makes it easier for others to find the right templates, improving team efficiency and reducing training time.

These organizational benefits scale with the size of your template library and team.

#### How can I create main folders for top-level organization?

<Steps>
1. Go to the **Templates** section (library).
2. Click the **New Folder** button (usually in the panel on the left).
3. Give your folder a clear name (e.g., "Marketing Templates").
4. Click **Create**.
</Steps>

The new folder will appear on the left. Click it to see inside or add templates to it.

#### How do I create subfolders for detailed categorization?

<Steps>
1. Click on the folder you want to put a new folder inside (the parent folder) on the left.
2. Click the **New Folder** button again.
3. Give the subfolder a name (e.g., "Email Campaigns" inside the "Marketing Templates" folder).
4. Click **Create**.
</Steps>

Subfolders will show up indented under their parent folder on the left.

#### How can I move templates into organized folders?

<Steps>
1. In the main Library view (or inside a folder), find the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) you want to move.
2. Click the menu icon (three dots â‹®) on the template card.
3. Choose **Move** from the menu.
4. Select the folder you want to move the template into.
5. Click **Move**.
</Steps>

#### How do I manage existing folders (rename, move, delete)?

<Steps>
1. Click on the folder you want to manage in the left panel.
2. Click the pencil icon next to the folder's name.

3. In the box that appears, you can:
    - **Rename** the folder.
    - **Move** the folder by choosing a different parent folder.
    - **Delete** the folder.

</Steps>

*Important: Deleting a folder does **not** delete the templates inside it. The templates will just move back to the main library view (unfoldered).* 

#### What happens when I restore an archived template?

If you restore an archived [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/):
- It will go back into the folder it was in before you archived it (if that folder still exists).
- If the folder was deleted, the template will go into the main library view.

<Steps>
1. Go to the **Templates** section and click the **Archived** tab.
2. Find the template you want to bring back.
3. Click the **Unarchive** button.

#### What are best practices for effective folder organization?
- Use clear, consistent names for your folders that describe their contents accurately.
- Try not to make too many levels of subfolders (2-3 levels is usually best) to avoid over-complexity.
- Group templates in ways that make sense for your company (e.g., by department, function, or process type).
- Use folder names that tell you what's inside without requiring explanation.
- Review your folders periodically and clean them up if needed to maintain organization.
- Use tags in addition to folders for more specific labeling and cross-categorization.

These practices ensure your folder structure remains intuitive and maintainable as your template library grows.
