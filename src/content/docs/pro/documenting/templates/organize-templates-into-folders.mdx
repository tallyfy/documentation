## Organizing templates with folders

Folders provide a hierarchical structure for template management, enabling efficient organization and quick access to your process library.

:::note[Important distinction]
Template folders are completely separate from folders used for active tasks and processes. Each system has its own set of folders:
- Template folders (discussed in this article) are for organizing your process library
- Task/Process folders are for organizing active tasks and processes in the Tasks and Tracker views

**Why the separation?** The organizational structure needed for templates often differs from what's needed for running processes:

**Example 1:** You might have a templates folder called "HR" with an "Employee Onboarding" template. When you launch this template, you could organize the actual onboarding processes by department in folders like "Sales Onboardings" or "IT Onboardings."

**Example 2:** You might keep client-related templates in a "Client Ops" folder. But when running these processes, you'd want to organize them by client name (e.g., "Coca Cola Work Requests") to group all active work for a specific client.

### Best practices for folder organization
- Create a consistent naming convention for folders
- Limit folder hierarchy to 2-3 levels for easy navigation
- Group templates by business function or department
- Use descriptive folder names that clearly indicate contents
- Regularly review and clean up your folder structure
