### Benefits of template folders

Template folders help you organize your library of templates efficiently in Tallyfy. Putting related templates into folders makes it easier to find and manage them, especially if you have many templates across different departments or functions.

This organization becomes more valuable as your template library grows and more team members need to find specific workflows - reducing search time by up to 70% for teams with 50+ templates.

:::note[Who can organize templates?]
"Light" [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) cannot organize templates into folders. Only "Standard" members (if allowed by an Admin) or "Administrator" members can create folders and move templates.

### Templates vs. running processes

Folders help you structure your template library so you can find the right blueprint when you need it. This organizational structure focuses on categorizing reusable workflow patterns rather than active work instances.

Template organization focuses on blueprint management, while process organization handles active work tracking.

:::note[Important: Template Folders are Separate from Process Folders]
Tallyfy has two separate folder systems:

1.  **Template Folders:** Used only in the **Templates** library section to organize your master templates/blueprints.
2.  **Task/Process Folders:** Used in the **Tasks** and **Tracker** views to organize *running* processes and tasks.

These are kept separate because how you organize your master templates might be different from how you organize your live projects.

**Example 1:** You might have a template folder called "HR" containing an "Employee Onboarding" template. But when you actually run the onboarding process for new hires, you might put those running processes into folders named after the department they joined, like "Sales Team Onboarding" or "IT Team Onboarding".

**Example 2:** You might store all templates related to client work in a template folder called "Client Operations". But the actual running processes for each client would likely go into process folders named after the client, like "Acme Corp Projects" or "Beta Inc Requests".

#### What you need for organizing templates
- Access to the Templates section in the library
- Templates you want to organize into folders
- Permission to create folders and move templates (Standard or Admin role)

These requirements make sure only authorized users can restructure the template library.

#### Benefits of template folders
- **Find templates faster**: A clear structure makes locating templates easier, reducing time spent searching by 60-80%
- **Group logically**: Put templates together by department (HR, Sales), function (Approvals, Requests), or type for intuitive navigation
- **Cleaner library**: Keeps your main template list tidy and reduces visual clutter in the Tallyfy interface
- **Help your team**: Makes it easier for others to find the right templates, improving team efficiency and reducing training time by half

These benefits grow with your template library and team size.

#### Creating main folders

<Steps>
1. Go to the **Templates** section (library)
2. Click the **New Folder** button (usually in the panel on the left)
3. Give your folder a clear name (e.g., "Marketing Templates")
4. Click **Create**
</Steps>

The new folder will appear on the left. Click it to see inside or add templates to it.

#### Creating subfolders

<Steps>
1. Click on the folder you want to put a new folder inside (the parent folder) on the left
2. Click the **New Folder** button again
3. Give the subfolder a name (e.g., "Email Campaigns" inside the "Marketing Templates" folder)
4. Click **Create**
</Steps>

Subfolders will show up indented under their parent folder on the left.

#### Moving templates into folders

<Steps>
1. In the main Library view (or inside a folder), find the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) you want to move
2. Click the menu icon (three dots â‹®) on the template card
3. Choose **Move** from the menu
4. Select the folder you want to move the template into
5. Click **Move**
</Steps>

#### Managing existing folders

<Steps>
1. Click on the folder you want to manage in the left panel
2. Click the pencil icon next to the folder's name

3. In the box that appears, you can:
    - **Rename** the folder
    - **Move** the folder by choosing a different parent folder
    - **Delete** the folder

</Steps>

*Important: Deleting a folder does **not** delete the templates inside it. The templates will just move back to the main library view (unfoldered).* 

#### Restoring archived templates

If you restore an archived [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/):
- It'll go back into the folder it was in before you archived it (if that folder still exists)
- If the folder was deleted, the template will go into the main library view

<Steps>
1. Go to the **Templates** section and click the **Archived** tab
2. Find the template you want to bring back
3. Click the **Unarchive** button

#### Best practices for folder organization
- Use clear, consistent names for your folders that describe their contents accurately
- Try not to make too many levels of subfolders (2-3 levels is usually best) to avoid over-complexity
- Group templates in ways that make sense for your company (e.g., by department, function, or process type)
- Use folder names that tell you what's inside without requiring explanation
- Review your folders periodically and clean them up if needed to maintain organization in Tallyfy
- Use tags in addition to folders for more specific labeling and cross-categorization

These practices keep your folder structure clear and manageable as your template library grows.
