### Why use template folders?

Template folders allow you to organize related [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) together, making it easier to navigate and manage large template libraries. Proper organization helps teams quickly find the templates they need and maintains a structured approach to process management.

:::note[Role permission requirement]
Members with a "Light" role cannot create or edit templates, including organizing them into folders. Only members with a "Standard" role (if they have appropriate permissions) or "Administrator" role can organize templates into folders.

### Organizing templates with folders

Folders provide a hierarchical structure for template management, enabling efficient organization and quick access to your process library.

:::note[Important distinction]
Template folders are completely separate from folders used for active [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) and [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). Each system has its own set of folders:
- Template folders (discussed in this article) are for organizing your process library
- Task/Process folders are for organizing active tasks and processes in the [Tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/) and [Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/) views

**Why the separation?** The organizational structure needed for templates often differs from what's needed for running processes:

**Example 1:** You might have a templates folder called "HR" with an "Employee Onboarding" template. When you [launch](/products/pro/launching/) this template, you could organize the actual onboarding processes by department in folders like "Sales Onboardings" or "IT Onboardings."

**Example 2:** You might keep client-related templates in a "Client Ops" folder. But when running these [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), you'd want to organize them by client name (e.g., "Coca Cola Work Requests") to group all active work for a specific client.

##### Deleting folders
When you delete a folder:
- The folder is removed from the navigation panel

- Templates are moved back to the main library

#### Working with archived Templates

When you unarchive a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), it returns to its original folder location if the folder still exists.

<Steps>
1. Click the **Archived** tab in the Templates section 
2. Locate the template you want to restore
3. Click the **Unarchive** button

#### Best practices for folder organization
- Create a consistent naming convention for folders
- Limit folder hierarchy to 2-3 levels for easy navigation
- Group templates by business function or department
- Use descriptive folder names that clearly indicate contents
- Regularly review and clean up your folder structure
- Add descriptive tags for easier filtering
- Create folders for different [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) categories
- Document customizations made to sample templates
