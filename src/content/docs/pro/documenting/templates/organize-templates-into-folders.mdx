### Why use template folders?

Template folders help you organize your library of [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). Putting related templates into folders makes it easier to find and manage them, especially if you have many templates.

:::note[Who can organize templates?]
"Light" [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) cannot organize templates into folders. Only "Standard" members (if allowed by an Admin) or "Administrator" members can create folders and move templates.
:::

### Organizing templates vs. organizing running processes

Folders help you structure your template library so you can find the right blueprint when you need it.

:::note[Important: Template Folders are Separate from Process Folders]
Tallyfy has two separate folder systems:

1.  **Template Folders:** Used only in the **Templates** library section to organize your master templates/blueprints.
2.  **Task/Process Folders:** Used in the **Tasks** and **Tracker** views to organize *running* processes and tasks.

These are kept separate because how you organize your master templates might be different from how you organize your live projects.

**Example 1:** You might have a template folder called "HR" containing an "Employee Onboarding" template. But when you actually run the onboarding process for new hires, you might put those running processes into folders named after the department they joined, like "Sales Team Onboarding" or "IT Team Onboarding".

**Example 2:** You might store all templates related to client work in a template folder called "Client Operations". But the actual running processes for each client would likely go into process folders named after the client, like "Acme Corp Projects" or "Beta Inc Requests".

#### What you need
- Access to the **Templates** section in the library.
- Templates that you want to put into folders.
- Permission to create folders and move templates (Standard or Admin role).

#### Benefits of using folders for templates
- **Find templates faster**: A clear structure makes locating templates easier.
- **Group logically**: Put templates together by department (HR, Sales), function (Approvals, Requests), or type.
- **Cleaner library**: Keeps your main template list tidy.
- **Help your team**: Makes it easier for others to find the right templates.

#### Creating main folders (top-level)

<Steps>
1. Go to the **Templates** section (library).
2. Click the **New Folder** button (usually in the panel on the left).
3. Give your folder a clear name (e.g., "Marketing Templates").
4. Click **Create**.
</Steps>

The new folder will appear on the left. Click it to see inside or add templates to it.

#### Creating folders inside folders (subfolders)

<Steps>
1. Click on the folder you want to put a new folder inside (the parent folder) on the left.
2. Click the **New Folder** button again.
3. Give the subfolder a name (e.g., "Email Campaigns" inside the "Marketing Templates" folder).
4. Click **Create**.
</Steps>

Subfolders will show up indented under their parent folder on the left.

#### Moving templates into folders

<Steps>
1. In the main Library view (or inside a folder), find the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) you want to move.
2. Click the menu icon (three dots â‹®) on the template card.
3. Choose **Move** from the menu.
4. Select the folder you want to move the template into.
5. Click **Move**.
</Steps>

#### Managing folders (Rename, Move, Delete)

<Steps>
1. Click on the folder you want to manage in the left panel.
2. Click the pencil icon next to the folder's name.

3. In the box that appears, you can:
    - **Rename** the folder.
    - **Move** the folder by choosing a different parent folder.
    - **Delete** the folder.

</Steps>

*Important: Deleting a folder does **not** delete the templates inside it. The templates will just move back to the main library view (unfoldered).* 

#### What happens when you unarchive a Template?

If you restore an archived [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/):
- It will go back into the folder it was in before you archived it (if that folder still exists).
- If the folder was deleted, the template will go into the main library view.

<Steps>
1. Go to the **Templates** section and click the **Archived** tab.
2. Find the template you want to bring back.
3. Click the **Unarchive** button.

#### Tips for organizing folders
- Use clear, consistent names for your folders.
- Try not to make too many levels of subfolders (2-3 levels is usually best).
- Group templates in ways that make sense for your company (e.g., by department).
- Use folder names that tell you what's inside.
- Review your folders sometimes and clean them up if needed.
- Use tags *in addition* to folders for more specific labeling.
