## Tracking template activities and changes

The template Activity stream maintains comprehensive logs of all template modifications, providing complete change visibility and audit trail capabilities.

This tracking system helps monitor template evolution, identify specific changes, responsible users, and modification timestamps for enhanced governance and troubleshooting.

### Access to template activity logs
- Administrators with full system access.
- Standard members who have permission to view the specific template.
- The person who originally created the template (template owner).

### Benefits of template activity tracking

Template activity tracking provides essential governance and troubleshooting capabilities:

- **Comprehensive Change History**: Maintain complete records of all template modifications for audit and compliance purposes
- **User Accountability**: Identify specific users responsible for particular changes, ensuring transparency and responsibility across teams
- **Evolution Analysis**: Understand template development patterns and modification trends over time for continuous improvement
- **Issue Resolution**: Rapidly identify when changes may have introduced problems or unexpected workflow behavior
- **Compliance Evidence**: Provide evidence of how processes are managed and controlled (useful for regulatory compliance).

### Types of tracked activities

The activity log records comprehensive changes to templates for complete visibility:

#### Content changes tracked
- Changes to the template's title or description for identification updates.
- Changes to step titles or descriptions for clarity improvements.
- Adding or removing steps to modify workflow structure.
- Updates to task instructions for enhanced guidance.

#### Field modifications tracked
- Creating new form fields to collect additional data.
- Changing field settings such as validation rules or required status.
- Deleting fields that are no longer needed.

#### Configuration changes tracked
- Adding or removing template tags for organization.
- Changing permission settings for access control.
- Creating or changing webhooks for external integrations.
- Updating automation rules for workflow enhancement.
- Archiving or unarchiving the template for lifecycle management.

#### User interactions tracked
- Copying (duplicating) the template for reuse.
- Publishing the template to make it available.
- Importing or exporting the template for migration.
- When users view the template for access auditing.

### Accessing the activity log

1. Go to the main **Templates** library.

### Understanding the activity log

The log shows entries with the newest changes at the top for easy chronological review:

- **When**: The date and time the action happened for precise timing.
- **Who**: The name of the user who made the change for accountability.
- **What**: The type of action that took place for change categorization.
- **Details**: More information about exactly what was changed for complete understanding.

:::note[Activity timestamp display]
Activity log timestamps are stored on our server in ISO 8601 format without timezone information. In the Tallyfy interface, these timestamps are automatically converted to display in your personal timezone setting, ensuring you see accurate local times while maintaining consistent data storage.

### Activity log retention

- Activity logs are kept for as long as the template exists in the system.
- If you archive a template, its history is still preserved for reference.
- If you duplicate (copy) a template, the new copy gets a brand new, empty activity log.
- You cannot edit or delete activity log entries to maintain audit integrity.

### Authorized access to activity logs

Only certain people can view a template's activity log based on permission levels:
- Administrator members with full system access.
- Standard members who have been given permission to view that specific template.
- The person who created the template (original owner).

This access control keeps sensitive change information secure while providing necessary visibility to authorized stakeholders.
