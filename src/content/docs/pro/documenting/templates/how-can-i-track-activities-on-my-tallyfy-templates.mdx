## Monitoring template activities

The Activity stream provides a detailed audit trail of all changes and interactions with templates, enabling accountability and change tracking.

### Prerequisites
- Administrator access or explicit template access permissions
- A template with activity history

### Benefits of activity tracking
- **Audit trail** - Maintain records of who changed what and when
- **Accountability** - Identify which users made specific modifications
- **Change management** - Track the evolution of templates over time
- **Troubleshooting** - Identify when problematic changes were introduced
- **Compliance** - Provide evidence of process governance and oversight

### Types of tracked activities

The activity log captures comprehensive information about template modifications:

#### Content changes

### Activity log retention
