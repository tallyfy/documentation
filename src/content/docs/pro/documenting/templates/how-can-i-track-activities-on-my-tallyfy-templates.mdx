## How to view the template activity log

The Activity stream (or log) keeps a detailed history of all changes made to a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). This helps you see who changed what and when.

### Who can see the Activity Log?
- Administrators.
- Standard [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) who have permission to view the specific template.
- The person who originally created the template.

### Why track template activity?
- **See History**: Keep a record of all changes.
- **Know Who Did What**: See which users made specific changes.
- **Track Changes Over Time**: Understand how a template has been updated.
- **Find Problems**: Help figure out when a change might have caused an issue.
- **Show Proof**: Provide evidence of how processes are managed (useful for compliance).

### What kind of activities are tracked?

The activity log records many types of changes to a template:

#### Content changes
- Changes to the template's title or description.
- Changes to step titles or descriptions.
- Adding or removing steps.
- Updates to [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) instructions.

#### Field changes
- Creating new [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/).
- Changing field settings.
- Deleting fields.

#### Setting changes
- Adding or removing template tags.
- Changing permission settings.
- Creating or changing [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/).
- Updating [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) rules.
- Archiving or unarchiving the template.

#### User actions
- Copying (duplicating) the template.
- Publishing the template.
- Importing or exporting the template.
- When users view the template.

### How to see the activity log

1. Go to the main **Templates** library.
2. Find the template you want to check.
3. Click **View** for that template.
4. Click the **Activity** tab.

### Reading the activity log

The log shows entries with the newest changes at the top:

- **When**: The date and time the action happened.
- **Who**: The name of the user who made the change.
- **What**: The type of action that took place.
- **Details**: More information about exactly what was changed.

### How long are logs kept?

- Activity logs are kept for as long as the template exists.
- If you archive a template, its history is still kept.
- If you duplicate (copy) a template, the new copy gets a brand new, empty activity log.
- You cannot edit or delete activity log entries.

### Who can see the Activity Log?

Only certain people can view a template's activity log:
- Administrator members.
- Standard [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) who have been given permission to view that specific template.
- The person who created the template.
