## How to view the template activity log

The Activity stream provides a detailed audit trail of all changes and interactions with [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), enabling accountability and change tracking.

### Requirements
- Administrator access or explicit template access permissions
- A template with activity history

### Benefits of activity tracking
- **Audit trail** - Maintain records of who changed what and when
- **Accountability** - Identify which users made specific modifications
- **Change management** - Track the evolution of templates over time
- **Troubleshooting** - Identify when problematic changes were introduced
- **Compliance** - Provide evidence of process governance and oversight

### Types of tracked activities

The activity log captures comprehensive information about template modifications:

#### Content changes
- Template title and description updates
- Step title and description modifications
- Addition or removal of steps
- Changes to [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) instructions and guidance

#### Field management
- Creation of new [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/)
- Modification of field properties
- Deletion of fields

#### Configuration adjustments
- Template tag additions and removals
- Permission setting changes
- [Webhook](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) creation, modification, and deletion
- [Automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) rule updates
- Template archiving and unarchiving

#### User interactions

- Template publishing actions
- Template import/export activities
- User view access events

### Interpreting the activity log

The activity log displays entries in reverse chronological order (newest first):

- Each entry shows the **date and time** of the action
- The **user name** of the person who performed the action
- The specific **action type** that occurred
- Detailed information about **what changed**

### Activity log retention

- Activity logs are maintained for the life of the template
- Archived templates retain their activity history
- If a template is duplicated, the new copy starts with a fresh activity log
- Activity logs cannot be edited or deleted

### Access control

Access to template activity logs is restricted to:
- Administrator members
- Standard [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) with explicit permissions to view the template
- The template creator
