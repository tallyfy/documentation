## Tracking template activities and changes

Click the **Activity** tab when viewing any template in Tallyfy to see a full history of who changed what and when. Every modification - from title edits to automation updates - gets recorded automatically.

### Who can view template activity logs?

Tallyfy restricts activity log access to:
- Administrators
- Standard members with read or edit permission on that template
- The template creator

### Why activity tracking matters

Think someone accidentally broke your workflow? The activity log shows exactly when things changed.

- **Change history** - every modification gets recorded, perfect for audits
- **Accountability** - you'll know exactly who made each change
- **Troubleshooting** - check when the last changes were made and undo if needed
- **Compliance** - prove how your processes are controlled and who's responsible

### What gets tracked?

Tallyfy records four main categories of template changes:

#### Content changes
- Template title and summary updates
- Step creation, deletion, and reordering
- Step descriptions, deadlines, and assignee changes
- Guidance text added, updated, or removed

#### Form field updates
- Kick-off form field descriptions added or changed
- Form field values added or updated

#### Configuration changes
- Tags added or removed
- Permission changes
- Webhook updates on steps
- Automation rules created, updated, or deleted
- Template archiving and unarchiving
- Folder assignment changes

#### Other tracked actions
- Template creation and deletion
- Auto-naming configuration changes
- Owner changes

### How to check the activity log

1. Go to your **Templates** library
2. Open the template you want to check
3. Click **View**
4. Select the **Activity** tab

### Reading the activity log

The newest changes appear at the top. Each entry shows:

- **When** - exact date and time
- **Who** - which team member made the change
- **What** - the type of change (created, updated, deleted, archived, etc.)
- **Details** - what specifically was modified

For example: "March 15, 2025 at 2:47 PM - Sarah Johnson - Step Deadline Updated - Changed 'Review proposal' deadline from 2 days to 3 days."

:::note[Activity timestamp display]
Timestamps are stored in ISO 8601 format[^1]. Tallyfy displays them in your personal timezone setting, so you'll always see accurate local times.

### How long do logs last?

Activity logs persist as long as the template exists. Archive a template? The history stays intact.

Copied templates start fresh with a blank activity log - they're treated as new templates.

You can't edit or delete log entries. This keeps the audit trail[^2] trustworthy.

### Access control

Activity logs are only visible to administrators, members with template read/edit permissions, and the template creator.
