  or procedure template from all relevant members in your Tallyfy organization.
title: How to request bulk acknowledgement for a template
---

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

It's often necessary to ensure that all members of your organization, or specific groups, have acknowledged a policy document, a new procedure, or other important information captured in a [Tallyfy template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). You can achieve this by creating a one-off task and linking it to your existing template.

This method applies to both [document templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) and [procedure templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).

## Prerequisites

- You must have an existing [document template](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) or [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) that you want members to acknowledge.
- You need appropriate permissions to create tasks and assign them to members or groups.

## Steps to request bulk acknowledgement

<Steps>
1.  **Create a one-off task**
    Navigate to **+ Create** in the main Tallyfy menu and select **Task**.

2.  **Name your task**
    Give your task a clear name, for example, "Acknowledge updated WFH Policy" or "Confirm review of new QA Procedure."

3.  **Link the task to your template**
    Under the task description, find the **Link this task to** section. Click **Choose** and select **Template**. Search for and select the [document template](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) or [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) that requires acknowledgement. This provides assignees with direct access to the content they need to review.

4.  **Assign the task**
    Click on **Assign to** and select the members or [groups](/products/pro/documenting/groups/how-to-manage-groups-and-assign-tasks-in-tallyfy/) who need to acknowledge the template. You can assign it to "Everyone" if all members in your organization need to complete it.

5.  **Require completion from all assignees**
    This is a critical step. In the task settings (you may need to click **Show advanced settings**), locate the option **All assignees must complete this task** and toggle it to **Yes** (or **ON**). This ensures the overall task is only marked as complete when every single assignee has individually completed their acknowledgement.

    *Image shows the 'All assignees must complete this task' setting.*

6.  **Set a deadline (optional)**
    If acknowledgement is time-sensitive, set an appropriate **Deadline** for the task.

7.  **Create the task**
    Click **Create Task**. Each assignee will receive a notification and the task will appear in their [Tasks view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/).
</Steps>

## Understanding "All assignees must complete this task"

When you enable the **All assignees must complete this task** option:

-   The task will not be considered fully complete until every person it's assigned to has individually marked their instance of the task as done.
-   You can track progress, often seeing a counter like "X of Y completed."
-   This feature is particularly useful for compliance, policy acknowledgements, or any scenario where individual confirmation from multiple people is required.

For more details on this and other advanced task settings, see the [Advanced task options guide](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-can-i-utilize-tallyfys-advanced-tab-features/).

This approach ensures that your important documents and procedures are reviewed and acknowledged by the necessary personnel, with clear tracking of who has completed their part.
