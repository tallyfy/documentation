Create a one-off task in Tallyfy, link it to your template, and assign it to your team - everyone gets their own acknowledgement to complete. This works for both [document templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) and [procedure templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).

## Requirements

You'll need:
- An existing [document template](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) or [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)
- Permission to create and assign tasks - typically an Administrator or Standard user[^1]

## Requesting bulk acknowledgement

<Steps>
1.  **Create a one-off task**
    Go to **+ Create** in the main Tallyfy menu and pick **Task**.

2.  **Name your task**
    Use a clear name like "Acknowledge updated WFH Policy" or "Confirm review of new QA Procedure."

3.  **Link the task to your template**
    Under the task description, find **Link this task to**. Click **Choose**, then **Template**. Search for your [document template](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) or [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) and select it. Assignees can then see exactly what they're acknowledging.

4.  **Assign the task**
    Click **Assign to** and choose who needs to acknowledge. Pick specific members, entire [groups](/products/pro/documenting/groups/how-to-manage-groups-and-assign-tasks-in-tallyfy/), or select "Everyone" for the whole organization.

5.  **Require completion from all assignees**
    This step matters. In the task settings, find **All assignees must complete this task**[^2] and set it to **Yes**. Without this, the task completes when just one person finishes. With it, every assignee must check in individually.

6.  **Set a deadline**
    Add a **Deadline** - this is a required field when creating a one-off task.

7.  **Create the task**
    Click **Create Task**. Everyone gets notified, and the task appears in their [Tasks view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/).
</Steps>

## The "all assignees must complete" setting

When you assign a task to 50 people with this option on, all 50 must mark their individual task as complete before Tallyfy considers it done.

-   Each person gets their own instance of the task - they can't complete it for someone else
-   Progress is tracked in real-time
-   Ideal for compliance audits, safety procedures, and policy updates where you need confirmation from everyone
