import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Need everyone to acknowledge that new policy? Create a one-off task in Tallyfy, link it to your template, and assign it to your team - everyone gets their own acknowledgement to complete. Simple.

Here's the thing: This works for both [document templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) (like your employee handbook) and [procedure templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) (think quality control checklists). Same process, same peace of mind.

## What do you need for bulk acknowledgement?

Before you start, you'll need:
- An existing [document template](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) or [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) that needs acknowledging (can't acknowledge what doesn't exist, right?)
- Permission to create tasks and assign them to members or groups in Tallyfy - usually means you're an Administrator or Standard user[^1]

## How do I request bulk acknowledgement?

<Steps>
1.  **Create a one-off task**
    Head to **+ Create** in the main Tallyfy menu and pick **Task**. Takes two clicks.

2.  **Name your task**
    Make it crystal clear what you're asking for - something like "Acknowledge updated WFH Policy" or "Confirm review of new QA Procedure." Nobody likes vague task names.

3.  **Link the task to your template**
    Here's where the magic happens. Under the task description, you'll spot the **Link this task to** section. Click **Choose**, then **Template**. Search for your [document template](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) or [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) and select it. Now everyone can actually see what they're acknowledging - no more hunting for documents!

4.  **Assign the task**
    Click **Assign to** and choose who needs to acknowledge this. Pick specific members, entire [groups](/products/pro/documenting/groups/how-to-manage-groups-and-assign-tasks-in-tallyfy/), or go big with "Everyone" if your whole organization needs to be on board.

5.  **Require completion from all assignees**
    Pay attention here - this step matters. In the task settings (might need to click **Show advanced settings**), find **All assignees must complete this task[^2]** and flip it to **Yes**. Without this, the task completes when just one person finishes. With it? Everyone has to check in. Big difference.

6.  **Set a deadline (optional)**
    Got a compliance deadline breathing down your neck? Add a **Deadline** to keep everyone on track. Skip this if timing's flexible.

7.  **Create the task**
    Hit **Create Task** and you're done. Everyone gets notified instantly, and the task pops up in their [Tasks view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/). Time to watch those acknowledgements roll in.
</Steps>

## How does "All assignees must complete this task" work?

Think of it like this: You've assigned the task to 50 people. With this option turned on, all 50 need to mark their individual task as complete before Tallyfy considers the whole thing done. No shortcuts.

Here's what happens:

-   Each person gets their own copy of the task - they can't complete it for someone else
-   You'll see progress tracked in real-time, usually something like "23 of 50 completed" 
-   Perfect for those situations where you absolutely need confirmation from everyone - compliance audits, safety procedures, policy updates. You know, the stuff that keeps lawyers happy.

Bottom line: This gives you bulletproof tracking of who's acknowledged what. No more chasing people down or wondering if everyone's actually read that critical update. Tallyfy handles the heavy lifting - you just watch the acknowledgements come in.
