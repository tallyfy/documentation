## Organizing steps with milestones

Milestones group your [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) steps into collapsible sections. They're optional - steps without a milestone appear in an "unmapped" section at the bottom.

### Creating a milestone

<Steps>
1. Open your template in edit mode
2. Click **Create milestone**
3. Enter a name (max 250 characters)
4. Click **Accept**
</Steps>

### Managing steps in milestones

- **Add steps**: Drag steps into a milestone section, or create new steps while a milestone is selected
- **Move steps**: Drag between milestones, or drag to unmapped to ungroup
- **Reorder milestones**: Drag milestone headers to change their order

### Renaming and deleting

Right-click a milestone header to rename or delete it. Deleting a milestone moves its steps to the unmapped section.

### Milestones in running processes

When you [launch a process](/products/pro/launching/), milestones carry over. [Tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) appear grouped under the same collapsible milestone sections.

### Milestones in exports

[CSV exports](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/how-can-i-export-tallyfy-processes-to-csv/) include `milestone_id`, `milestone_name`, and `milestone_position` columns. Tasks without a milestone show empty values.
