## Duplicating templates

Duplicating a template makes an exact copy of an existing [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). This is useful if you want to create a slightly different version of a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) without starting over, or if you want to test changes safely.

:::note[Who can duplicate templates?]
[Members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) with a "Light" role cannot duplicate templates. Only "Standard" members (if an Admin allows them) or "Administrator" members can duplicate templates.
:::

### What you need for duplication
- Permission to access the template you want to copy
- Permission to create new templates in your account
- To know what gets copied and what doesn't (see below)

### Why duplicate templates?
- **Save time**: No need to build similar templates from scratch - saves 2-3 hours per template
- **Keep consistency**: Start with the same basic process structure but make small changes
- **Create versions**: Make different versions for different teams or situations (e.g., Sales vs. Marketing onboarding)
- **Test changes safely**: Make changes to the copy without messing up the original template in Tallyfy
- **Keep old versions**: Save older versions of a process while you work on a new one

### Duplication process

<Steps>
1. Go to the **Library** section where your templates are listed in Tallyfy
2. Find the template you want to copy
3. Click the **More** menu (three dots icon) on the template card
4. Choose **Duplicate** from the menu
5. Give the new copy a clear name - it helps to include something like "Copy" or a version number, or the team it's for (e.g., "Client Onboarding - Marketing Team Copy")
6. Click **Duplicate** - the entire process takes under 30 seconds
</Steps>

### What gets copied

The new template copy will include:
- All the steps in the same order
- All [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) descriptions and instructions
- All [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) and their settings
- All conditional logic (rules) and [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/)
- Who tasks are assigned to (if set in the original template)
- Any dependencies between steps (e.g., Step 2 can't start until Step 1 is done)
- The template description

### What doesn't get copied

Some things aren't copied, or they get new unique IDs in the copy:
- **Tags**: Any tags on the original template aren't copied
- **[Webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/)**: Any webhooks set up on the original template aren't copied
- **Internal IDs (Aliases)**: The unique internal IDs for fields and steps get new IDs in the copy (This usually only matters if you have external tools connected directly to specific fields/steps using these IDs)
- **History**: The copy starts with a blank activity and usage history
- **Template ID**: The copy gets its own brand new, unique Template ID in Tallyfy

### After duplicating

After you make a copy:
<Steps>
1. Check the new copy to make sure everything looks correct
2. Add any tags you need to help organize it
3. Set up any [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) again if the copy needs them
4. If you have other tools connected using the old template's internal field/step IDs, update them to use the new IDs from the copy
5. Make the changes you wanted to make to this new version
</Steps>
