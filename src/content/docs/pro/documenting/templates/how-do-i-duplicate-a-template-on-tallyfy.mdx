## Duplicating templates

To duplicate a template in Tallyfy, just click the **More** menu (three dots) on any template card and select **Duplicate**. That's it. You'll have an exact copy of your [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) ready to customize - perfect when you need a slightly different version of a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) or want to test changes without touching the original.

:::note[Who can duplicate templates?]
[Members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) with a "Light" role cannot duplicate templates. Only "Standard" members (if an Admin allows them) or "Administrator" members can duplicate templates.
:::

### What you need for duplication
- Permission to access the template you want to copy
- Permission to create new templates in your account  
- To know what gets copied and what doesn't (see below)

### Why duplicate templates?
- **Save time**: Skip rebuilding similar templates from scratch
- **Keep consistency**: Start with the same foundation but tweak for specific needs
- **Create versions**: Different teams often need their own spin (think Sales vs. Marketing onboarding)
- **Test changes safely**: Experiment on the copy - your original template in Tallyfy stays untouched
- **Keep old versions**: Archive what's working while you develop something new

### Duplication process

Here's how to make a copy:

<Steps>
1. Go to the **Templates** section where your templates live in Tallyfy
2. Find the template you want to copy
3. Click the **More** menu (three dots icon) on the template card
4. Choose **Duplicate** from the menu
5. Give your copy a clear name - adding "Copy" or a version number really helps (like "Client Onboarding - Marketing Team Copy")
6. Click **Duplicate** - done in under 30 seconds
</Steps>

### What gets copied

Good news - almost everything comes along for the ride:
- All the steps in the same order
- Every [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) description and instruction you wrote
- All [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) and their settings
- Your conditional logic (rules)[^2] and [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/)
- Task assignments (if you set them in the original template)
- Any dependencies between steps (like when Step 2 waits for Step 1)
- The template description

### What doesn't get copied

A few things start fresh with your copy:
- **Tags**: You'll need to add these again
- **[Webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/)**: These don't carry over from the original
- **Internal IDs (Aliases)[^1]**: Every field and step gets brand new IDs (only matters if you've connected external tools using these specific IDs)
- **History**: Your copy starts with a clean slate - no activity logs
- **Template ID**: The copy gets its own unique ID in Tallyfy

Simple enough.

### After duplicating

Once you've made your copy, here's what to do next:
<Steps>
1. Check the new template - make sure everything looks right
2. Add any tags you need to organize it
3. Set up [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) again if your copy needs them
4. Got external tools using the old template's field IDs? Update them to point to the new ones
5. Now make whatever changes you had in mind
</Steps>

import { CardGrid, LinkTitleCard } from "~/components";


[^1]: Each field gets a unique identifier like 'field_abc123' used by APIs and webhooks
[^2]: If-then logic that controls task visibility, assignment, or execution based on form data
