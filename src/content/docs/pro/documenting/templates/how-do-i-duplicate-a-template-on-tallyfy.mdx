## How to duplicate a template

Template duplication creates an identical copy of an existing [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), providing a starting point for creating variations or specialized versions of [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).

:::note[Role permission requirement]
[Members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) with a "Light" role cannot create or edit templates, including duplicating them. Only members with a "Standard" role (if they have appropriate permissions) or "Administrator" role can duplicate templates.
:::

### Requirements
- Access to the template you want to duplicate
- Permissions to create new templates
- Understanding of which elements transfer during duplication

### Benefits of Template duplication
- **Time savings** - Avoid rebuilding complex templates from scratch
- **Consistency** - Maintain core [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) structure while allowing customization
- **Specialization** - Create variations for different departments or use cases
- **Testing** - Safely experiment with process changes without affecting the original
- **Versioning** - Maintain different versions of evolving [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)

### Duplication process

<Steps>
1. Navigate to the **Library** section where templates are stored
2. Locate the template you want to duplicate
3. Click the **More** button (three dots) in the template card
4. Select **Duplicate** from the dropdown menu
5. Enter a descriptive name for the new template
   - Consider adding version numbers or department identifiers
   - Example: "Client Onboarding - Finance Dept"
6. Click **Duplicate** to create the copy
</Steps>

### What transfers during duplication

The duplicated template includes:
- All steps and their sequence
- [Task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) descriptions and instructions
- [Form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) and their properties
- Conditional logic and [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/)
- Assignments (if configured in the template)
- Dependencies between steps
- Template description

### Elements that don't transfer

Some elements receive new identifiers or don't transfer at all:
- **Tags** - Not copied to the new template
- **[Webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/)** - Step and template webhooks aren't transferred
- **Field aliases** - New unique identifiers are assigned
- **Step aliases** - New unique identifiers are assigned
- **Usage history** - The new template starts with a clean history
- **Template ID** - A new unique ID is generated

### Post-duplication steps

After duplicating a template:
<Steps>
1. Review the copy to ensure all elements transferred correctly
2. Add appropriate tags for organization
3. Reconfigure [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) if needed
4. Update any [integrations](/products/pro/integrations/) that rely on field or step aliases
5. Make intended modifications to customize the template
