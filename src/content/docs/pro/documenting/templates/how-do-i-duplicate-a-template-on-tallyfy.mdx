## Duplicating templates

Click the **More** menu (three dots) on any template card and select **Duplicate**. You'll get a copy of your [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) - perfect for creating a variant of a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) or testing changes without touching the original. The copy's title is automatically prefixed with "COPY OF -".

:::note[Who can duplicate templates?]
[Members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) with a "Light" role can't duplicate templates. Only "Standard" members (if an Admin allows them) or "Administrator" members can.
:::

### Why duplicate?
- **Save time** - skip rebuilding similar templates from scratch
- **Keep consistency** - start with the same foundation, then tweak for specific needs
- **Create versions** - different teams often need their own variant (e.g. Sales vs. Marketing onboarding)
- **Test safely** - experiment on the copy while the original stays untouched

### How to duplicate

<Steps>
1. Go to the **Templates** section in Tallyfy
2. Find the template you want to copy
3. Click the **More** menu (three dots icon) on the template card
4. Choose **Duplicate** from the menu
5. Rename your copy - adding a version number or team name helps
</Steps>

### What gets copied

Almost everything carries over:
- All steps in the same order
- [Task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) descriptions and instructions
- All [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) and their settings
- Conditional logic (rules)[^2] and [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/)
- Task assignments, group assignments, and guest assignments (within the same organization)
- Step dependencies and deadlines
- Tags and [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/)
- The template description

### What gets new values

A few things reset on your copy:
- **Internal IDs (Aliases)[^1]** - every field and step gets brand new IDs (only matters if you've connected external tools using these specific IDs)
- **History** - the copy starts with no activity logs
- **Template ID** - the copy gets its own unique ID in Tallyfy

### After duplicating

<Steps>
1. Review the new template to confirm everything looks right
2. If you use external tools pointing to the old template's field IDs, update them to the new ones
3. Make whatever changes you need
</Steps>

import { CardGrid, LinkTitleCard } from "~/components";


[^1]: Each field gets a unique identifier like 'field_abc123' used by APIs and webhooks
[^2]: If-then logic that controls task visibility, assignment, or execution based on form data
