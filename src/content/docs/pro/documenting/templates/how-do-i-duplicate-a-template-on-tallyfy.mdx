## How can I duplicate a template?

Duplicating a template makes an exact copy of an existing [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). This is useful if you want to create a slightly different version of a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) without starting over, or if you want to test changes safely.

:::note[Who can duplicate templates?]
[Members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) with a "Light" role cannot duplicate templates. Only "Standard" members (if an Admin allows them) or "Administrator" members can duplicate templates.
:::

### What do I need to duplicate a template?
- Permission to access the template you want to copy.
- Permission to create new templates in your account.
- To know what gets copied and what doesn't (see below).

### Why should I duplicate a template?
- **Save time**: No need to build similar templates from scratch.
- **Keep consistency**: Start with the same basic process structure but make small changes.
- **Create versions**: Make different versions for different teams or situations (e.g., Sales vs. Marketing onboarding).
- **Test changes safely**: Make changes to the copy without messing up the original template.
- **Keep old versions**: Save older versions of a process while you work on a new one.

### How do I duplicate a template?

<Steps>
1. Go to the **Library** section where your templates are listed.
2. Find the template you want to copy.
3. Click the **More** menu (three dots icon) on the template card.
4. Choose **Duplicate** from the menu.
5. Give the new copy a clear name. It helps to include something like "Copy" or a version number, or the team it's for (e.g., "Client Onboarding - Marketing Team Copy").
6. Click **Duplicate**.
</Steps>

### What gets copied when I duplicate a template?

The new template copy will include:
- All the steps in the same order.
- All [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) descriptions and instructions.
- All [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) and their settings.
- All conditional logic (rules) and [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/).
- Who tasks are assigned to (if set in the original template).
- Any dependencies between steps (e.g., Step 2 can't start until Step 1 is done).
- The template description.

### What does not get copied or gets changed?

Some things are not copied, or they get new unique IDs in the copy:
- **Tags**: Any tags on the original template are not copied.
- **[Webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/)**: Any webhooks set up on the original template are not copied.
- **Internal IDs (Aliases)**: The unique internal IDs for fields and steps get new IDs in the copy. (This usually only matters if you have external tools connected directly to specific fields/steps using these IDs).
- **History**: The copy starts with a blank activity and usage history.
- **Template ID**: The copy gets its own brand new, unique Template ID.

### What should I do after duplicating a template?

After you make a copy:
<Steps>
1. Check the new copy to make sure everything looks correct.
2. Add any tags you need to help organize it.
3. Set up any [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) again if the copy needs them.
4. If you have other tools connected using the old template's internal field/step IDs, update them to use the new IDs from the copy.
5. Make the changes you wanted to make to this new version.
