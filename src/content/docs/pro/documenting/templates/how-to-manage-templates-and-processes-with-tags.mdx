## How to use tags to organize templates and processes

Tags are like keywords or labels you can add to [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) and running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). They help you find and filter things in Tallyfy.

Unlike folders (where an item can only be in one folder), you can add multiple tags to the same template or process. This lets you organize things in many ways at once (e.g., a template could be tagged "HR", "Onboarding", and "High Priority").

:::note[Who can manage tags?]
"Light" [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) cannot add tags to templates. "Standard" members can add tags to templates they have permission to edit. Only "Administrators" can create, edit, or delete the shared list of tags for the whole organization.
:::

### What you need
- Administrator permission (to create/edit/delete the main tag list).
- Permission to edit a template or process (to add tags to it).

### Why use tags?

- **Find things faster**: Quickly search for templates or processes with specific tags.
- **Organize flexibly**: Group items in multiple ways without being limited by folders.
- **See labels easily**: Color-coded tags help you quickly identify items.
- **Filter lists**: Combine tags to narrow down the view in your [Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/).
- **Group related processes**: See all processes related to a topic (e.g., "Client Project") even if they are in different folders.

### Managing the organization's tag list (Admins only)

Administrators control the list of tags available for everyone to use:

<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Tags**.
2. To add a new tag, click **Add Tag**, type the name, choose a color, and save.
3. To change an existing tag's name, click its name, type the new name, and click **Save**.
4. To change an existing tag's color, click the colored square next to it, pick a new color, and click **Save**.

5. To delete a tag from the organization list, click the menu icon (â‹®) next to it.
6. Choose **Delete Tag**.
7. Confirm you want to delete it. (This removes the tag from the list and from any items it was applied to).
</Steps>

### Adding tags to Templates

Add tags to your [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) to make them easier to find in the library:

<Steps>
1. Open the template you want to tag in **Edit** mode.
2. Click **Settings** (or **Config**) in the top toolbar.
3. Go to the **Summary** tab.
4. Find the **Tag** field.
   - Start typing to search for existing tags.
   - Click on suggested tags to add them.
   - Type a completely new name and press Enter to create and add a new tag (if you have Admin rights).
5. Click **Save Changes**.
</Steps>

### Adding tags to running Processes

Add tags to active [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) to categorize them while they are running:

<Steps>
1. Open the running process you want to tag.
2. Click the **Add Tag** button (usually near the process title).
3. Choose from the list of existing tags or type to create a new one (if you have Admin rights).
4. Click away from the tag list to apply it.
</Steps>

### Filtering your view by tags

Use tags to show only specific items in your main dashboard:

<Steps>
1. Go to the **[Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** view.
2. Click the **Add filter** button.
   ![Accessing the filter menu](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-click-filter.png)
3. Choose **Tags** as the filter type.
4. Select one or more tags from the list.

5. The Tracker view will update to show only processes that have *all* the tags you selected.
</Steps>

### Tips for using tags effectively

- **Use consistent names**: Decide on standard tag names (e.g., always use "Human Resources" instead of sometimes using "HR").
- **Keep it simple**: Try to stick to a manageable number of main tags (maybe 10-15) so the list doesn't get too confusing.
- **Group logically**: Create tags for useful categories like:
  - Department (HR, Finance, Sales)
  - Type of work (Approval, Review, Onboarding)
  - Priority (High, Medium, Low)
  - Status (Testing, Live, Archived) - *Note: Tallyfy has built-in status too.*
- **Use with folders**: Tags work well alongside folders. Use folders for main structure and tags for more specific labels.
- **Clean up**: Occasionally review your tag list (in Settings) and delete tags that are no longer needed.
