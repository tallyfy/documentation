## Using tags for organization

Tags in Tallyfy are keywords you can add to [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) and running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) - think of them as flexible labels that help you find things instantly. Unlike folders where something can only live in one place, you can slap multiple tags on the same item.

Here's what makes tags powerful: A single template can be tagged "HR", "Onboarding", and "High Priority" all at once. Try doing that with folders!

:::note[Who can manage tags?]
"Light" [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) cannot add tags to templates. "Standard" members can add tags to templates they have permission to edit. Only "Administrators" can create, edit, or delete the shared list of tags[^1] for the whole organization.
:::

### What you need to use tags
- Administrator permission (to create/edit/delete the main tag list)
- Permission to edit a template or process (to add tags to it)

### Benefits of using tags

- **Find things faster**: Search for templates or processes with specific tags in seconds
- **Organize flexibly**: Group items in multiple ways - no more folder limitations
- **See labels easily**: Color-coded tags make identification instant
- **Filter lists**: Combine tags to narrow down exactly what you need in your [Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)
- **Group related processes**: See all processes for "Client Project" even if they're scattered across different folders

### Managing the organization's tag list (Admins only)

If you're an administrator, you control which tags everyone in your organization can use. Here's how:

<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Tags**
2. To add a new tag, click **Add Tag**, type the name, choose a color, and save
3. To change an existing tag's name, click its name, type the new name, and click **Save**
4. To change an existing tag's color, click the colored square next to it, pick a new color, and click **Save**

5. To delete a tag from the organization list, click the menu icon (⋮) next to it
6. Choose **Delete Tag**
7. Confirm you want to delete it (this removes the tag everywhere - from the list and any items using it)
</Steps>

### Adding tags to templates

Want to make your [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) easier to find? Add tags. Takes about 30 seconds:

<Steps>
1. Open the template you want to tag in **Edit** mode
2. Click **Settings** (or **Config**) in the top toolbar
3. Go to the **Summary** tab
4. Find the **Tag** field
   - Start typing to search for existing tags
   - Click on suggested tags to add them
   - Type a completely new name and press Enter to create and add a new tag (if you have Admin rights)
5. Click **Save Changes**
</Steps>

### Adding tags to running processes

Add tags to active [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) to categorize them while they are running:

<Steps>
1. Open the running process you want to tag
2. Click the **Add Tag** button (usually near the process title)
3. Choose from the list of existing tags or type to create a new one (if you have Admin rights)
4. Click away from the tag list to apply it
</Steps>

### Filtering by tags

Use tags to show only specific items in your Tallyfy dashboard:

<Steps>
1. Go to the **[Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** view
2. Click the **Add filter** button
   ![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-click-filter.png)
3. Choose **Tags** as the filter type
4. Select one or more tags from the list
   ![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-filter-process-by-tag.png)
5. The Tracker view will update to show only processes that have *all* the tags you selected
</Steps>

### Tips for effective tag usage

- **Use consistent names**: Decide on standard tag names (for example, always use "Human Resources" instead of sometimes using "HR")
- **Keep it simple**: Stick to a manageable number of main tags (around 10-15) so the list doesn't get too confusing
- **Group logically**: Create tags for useful categories like:
  - Department (HR, Finance, Sales)
  - Type of work (Approval, Review, Onboarding)
  - Priority (High, Medium, Low)
  - Status (Testing, Live, Archived) - *Note: Tallyfy has built-in status too*
- **Use with folders**: Tags work well alongside folders - use folders for main structure and tags for more specific labels
- **Clean up**: Occasionally review your tag list (in Settings) and delete tags that aren't needed anymore
