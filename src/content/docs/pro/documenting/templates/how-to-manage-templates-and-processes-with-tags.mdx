## How to manage and use tags for organization

Tags are flexible labels that help categorize and filter [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) and [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) in Tallyfy. Unlike folders that organize content in a hierarchical structure, tags allow for multi-dimensional classification, enabling items to belong to multiple categories simultaneously.

:::note[Role permission requirement]
[Members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) with a "Light" role cannot create or edit templates, including managing tags on templates. Only members with a "Standard" role (if they have appropriate permissions) or "Administrator" role can add or edit tags on templates.
:::

### Requirements
- Administrator access (to manage organization-wide tags)
- Template or process editing permissions (to apply tags)

### Benefits of using tags

- **Improved searchability** - Find specific templates and [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) quickly
- **Flexible organization** - Categorize items using multiple criteria simultaneously
- **Visual identification** - Color-coded tags provide visual cues
- **Dynamic filtering** - Combine tag filters to narrow down specific items
- **Process management** - Group related processes regardless of folder structure

### Tag management

Tags can be centrally managed through organization settings:

<Steps>
1. Navigate to **Settings > Organization > Tags**
2. To create a new tag, click **Add Tag**
3. To edit an existing tag:
   - Click on the tag name to modify its text
   - Click on the color swatch to change its color
   - Click **Save** when finished

4. To delete a tag:
   - Click the ellipsis (â‹®) icon next to the tag
   - Select **Delete Tag**
   - Confirm the deletion
</Steps>

### Tagging Templates

Add tags to [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) for better organization and discoverability:

<Steps>
1. Open the template in **Edit** mode
2. Click **Settings** in the toolbar
3. Select **Summary** from the dropdown
4. In the **Tag** field:
   - Type to search existing tags
   - Select from suggested tags
   - Create a new tag by typing a unique name
5. Click **Save Changes**
</Steps>

### Tagging Processes

Apply tags to active [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) for categorization and filtering:

<Steps>
1. Open the desired process
2. Click the **Add Tag** button near the process name
3. Select from existing tags or create a new one
4. Click outside the tag selector to apply
</Steps>

### Filtering by tags

Locate specific items using tag filters:

<Steps>
1. Navigate to the **[Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** section
2. Click **Add filter**
   ![Accessing the filter menu](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-click-filter.png)
3. Select **Tags** from the filter criteria
4. Choose one or more tags from the dropdown menu

5. The list will update to show only items with the selected tags
</Steps>

### Best practices for tagging

- **Consistent naming** - Establish a naming convention for tags
- **Limited number** - Use 10-15 primary tags to avoid overcomplication
- **Logical grouping** - Create tags that represent meaningful categories:
  - Department (HR, Finance, Marketing)
  - [Process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) type (Approval, Review, Onboarding)
  - Priority (High, Medium, Low)
  - Status (Active, Testing, Archived)
- **Combine with folders** - Use tags to complement, not replace, folder organization
- **Regular maintenance** - Periodically review and clean up unused tags
