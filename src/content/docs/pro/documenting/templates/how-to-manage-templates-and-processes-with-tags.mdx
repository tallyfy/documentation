## Using tags for organization

Tags in Tallyfy are keywords you attach to [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) and running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). Unlike folders, you can add multiple tags to the same item. A single template can be tagged "HR", "Onboarding", and "High Priority" all at once.

:::note[Who can manage tags?]
"Light" [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) can't add tags to templates. "Standard" members can add tags to templates they have edit access to. Only "Administrators" can create, edit, or delete the shared tag list[^1] for the whole organization.
:::

### Requirements

- Administrator permission to create, edit, or delete the organization's tag list
- Edit permission on a template or process to add tags to it

### Benefits of using tags

- **Find things faster** - search by specific tags in seconds
- **Organize flexibly** - group items in multiple ways without folder limitations
- **See labels easily** - color-coded tags make identification instant
- **Filter lists** - combine tags to narrow down your [Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/) view
- **Group related processes** - see all "Client Project" processes even if they span different folders

### Managing the organization's tag list (admins only)

Administrators control which tags everyone can use. Tag names can be up to 30 characters and must be unique within your organization.

<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Tags**
2. To add a tag, click **Add Tag**, type the name (max 30 characters), choose a color, and save
3. To rename a tag, click its name, type the new name, and click **Save**
4. To change a tag's color, click the colored square next to it, pick a new color, and click **Save**

5. To delete a tag, click the menu icon (⋮) next to it
6. Choose **Delete Tag**
7. Confirm deletion - this removes the tag from the list and all items using it
</Steps>

### Adding tags to templates

<Steps>
1. Open the template in **Edit** mode
2. Click **Settings** (or **Config**) in the top toolbar
3. Go to the **Summary** tab
4. Find the **Tag** field
   - Start typing to search existing tags
   - Click a suggested tag to add it
   - Type a new name and press Enter to create a tag (Admin rights required)
5. Click **Save Changes**
</Steps>

### Adding tags to running processes

<Steps>
1. Open the running process you want to tag
2. Click the **Add Tag** button near the process title
3. Pick from existing tags or type to create a new one (Admin rights required)
4. Click away from the tag list to apply
</Steps>

### Filtering by tags

<Steps>
1. Go to the **[Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** view
2. Click **Add filter**

5. The view updates to show only processes matching *all* selected tags
</Steps>

### Tips for effective tag usage

- **Use consistent names** - pick standard names (e.g., always "Human Resources" instead of sometimes "HR")
- **Keep it simple** - stick to around 10-15 main tags so the list stays manageable
- **Group logically** - create tags for categories like:
  - Department (HR, Finance, Sales)
  - Type of work (Approval, Review, Onboarding)
  - Priority (High, Medium, Low)
- **Use with folders** - folders for main structure, tags for cross-cutting labels
- **Clean up regularly** - review your tag list in Settings and delete unused tags
