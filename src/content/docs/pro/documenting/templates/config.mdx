## Template configuration options

The **Settings** button provides access to template customization and configuration options. These settings control overall behavior, permissions, and organization of your template.

Configuration areas include general actions (duplicating, archiving), content management (descriptions, videos), organization (folders, tags), and access controls (permissions).

## General settings

### Duplicate

Creates a copy of an existing template for further customization.

When duplicating, you can provide a custom name or use the default "COPY OF - [original template name]" format.

:::note[Duplication limitations]
Tags, step webhooks, and template webhooks are not transferred to the duplicated template.

### Archive

Removes a template from the active templates list. Archived templates can be restored later if needed.

### Print

Generates a printable version of the template that can be printed or saved as a PDF. For more details on printing and exporting templates, see [Print, Download, and Export Templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/print-download-export-templates/).

### Folderize

Moves the template to a specific folder for better organization. Learn more about organizing templates in [Organize Templates into Folders](/products/pro/documenting/templates/organize-templates-into-folders/).

## Summary settings

![Summary settings](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-configure-template-summary.png)

The Summary section provides template overview information and customization options:

* **Description** - Add explanatory text about the template
* **Status** - Indicates the current state of your template (Started, In Progress, Finishing, or Published). This status helps team members quickly identify whether a template is still being created or is ready for use. The status appears in the Templates section, providing at-a-glance information about template readiness.
* **Internal explanation video URL** - Add a URL to a video that explains the template's purpose and usage. Once added, a video icon appears in the Templates section, allowing users to access visual guidance about the template. This feature is useful for providing comprehensive template instructions in video format.
* **General information** - View assignees, creator, last update time, and other details
* **Force launcher to folderize process?** - When enabled, this option requires users to select or create a folder for the process before launching it. This prevents clutter by ensuring all processes are properly organized at creation. You can also set a default folder that will be pre-selected when launching.
* **Force launcher to tag process?** - When enabled, this option requires users to add at least one new or existing tag to the process before it can be launched. This ensures consistent process categorization and makes finding processes easier later.
* **Original document** - Upload source documents (Word, PDF, flowcharts) that inspired the template
* **Template tags** - Add organizational tags to help categorize templates in the library
* **Special instructions** - Add notes that appear before process launch. This text field is useful for providing important context or specific guidance to users launching the process.
* **Webhook settings** - Configure event notifications for task completion

:::note[About webhooks]
Webhooks send automated notifications to external applications when specific events occur. They function as event-driven triggers that send data to any receiving URL. For more information, see the [Webhooks section](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/).

## Activity tracking

The Activity tab displays a chronological log of all template changes, including who made them and when they occurred.

![Activity log](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-configure-template-activity.png)

## Permission settings

![Permission settings](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-configure-template-permissions.png)

Control who can view, edit, duplicate, and launch processes from your template with these options:

### Public visibility

Enable [public library](/products/pro/documenting/templates/how-to-make-my-tallyfy-template-public/) access to make the template visible to anyone worldwide.

### Template permissions

Configure who can edit, view, and duplicate the template. Options include allowing everyone or selecting specific individuals and groups.

### Process launch permissions

Control who can start processes using this template and access the resulting processes. Options include allowing everyone or selecting specific individuals and groups.

### One-off task settings

Control whether assigned members can add extra tasks to processes created from this template. Disabling this option prevents any additional tasks from being added, which is useful for compliance-critical processes.

In the Permissions tab, you'll find the setting **"Can people add one-off tasks to this process?"** with Yes/No options. This controls whether non-Administrator users can add ad-hoc (one-off) tasks to any process launched from this template.

- **Yes (Default)**: Allows anyone to add ad-hoc tasks to processes created from this template.
- **No**: Prevents non-Administrators from adding ad-hoc tasks to processes created from this template.

This setting is particularly useful for maintaining process integrity in regulated environments or compliance-critical workflows where additional tasks might compromise the standardized procedure.

## Export options

![Export settings](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-configure-template-tools.png)

This section displays the **Org ID** and **Template ID** needed for:
* Support communications
* Integration configuration
* Template copying between organizations

For transferring templates between organizations, both the Org ID and Template ID are required. See [Template Importing](/products/pro/documenting/templates/import-feature/) for details.

This feature is particularly useful for consultants who build templates in one organization for deployment in another.
