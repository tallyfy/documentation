## Template configuration options

The **Settings** button provides access to template customization and configuration options. These settings control overall behavior, permissions, and organization of your template.

Configuration areas include general actions (duplicating, archiving), content management (descriptions, videos), organization (folders, tags), and access controls (permissions).

### Duplicate

When duplicating, you can provide a custom name or use the default "COPY OF - [original template name]" format.

## Permission settings

Control who can view, edit, duplicate, and launch processes from your template with these options:

### Public visibility

Enable [public library](/products/pro/documenting/templates/how-to-make-my-tallyfy-template-public/) access to make the template visible to anyone worldwide.

### Template permissions

Configure who can edit, view, and duplicate the template. Options include allowing everyone or selecting specific individuals and groups.

### Process launch permissions

Control who can start processes using this template and access the resulting processes. Options include allowing everyone or selecting specific individuals and groups.

### One-off task settings

Control whether assigned members can add extra tasks to processes created from this template. Disabling this option prevents any additional tasks from being added, which is useful for compliance-critical processes.

## Export options

![Export settings](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-configure-template-tools.png)

This section displays the **Org ID** and **Template ID** needed for:
* Support communications
* Integration configuration
* Template copying between organizations

For transferring templates between organizations, both the Org ID and Template ID are required. See [Template Importing](/products/pro/documenting/templates/import-feature/) for details.

This feature is particularly useful for consultants who build templates in one organization for deployment in another.
