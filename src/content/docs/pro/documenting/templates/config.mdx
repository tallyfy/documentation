## Template settings

Click **Settings** (or **Config**) when editing a template in Tallyfy to control how it works, who can use it, and how it's organized.

:::note[Who can change template settings?]
Only [Members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) with the Administrator role, or Standard members given edit permission on the template, can change these settings. Light members can't edit templates.
:::

### General settings

#### Duplicate a template

Creates an exact copy of your template. The copy won't affect the original. Give it a new name, or it'll default to "COPY OF - [original template name]".

![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-configure-template-duplicate.png)

:::note[What gets copied]
Duplication copies steps, webhooks, and tags (within the same organization). If you duplicate across organizations, tags are recreated by name.
:::

#### Archive a template

Archiving soft-deletes the template from your library. It's not permanently removed - you can restore it later.

#### Print a template

Creates a printable version you can save as PDF. See [Print, Download, and Export Templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/print-download-export-templates/).

#### Organize templates into folders

Move templates into folders to keep your library tidy. See [Organize Templates into Folders](/products/pro/documenting/templates/organize-templates-into-folders/).

### Summary settings

![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-configure-template-summary.png)

* **Description**: Explain what the template is for.
* **Status**: Set "Published", "In Progress", etc. This shows in the main Templates view.
* **Internal explanation video URL**: Paste a video link. A video icon then appears next to the template for others to click.
* **General information**: Shows the creator, last updated date, and other metadata.
* **Force launcher to folderize [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)?**: Requires users to pick or create a folder *before* launching a process. You can also set a default folder.
* **Force launcher to tag process?**: Requires users to add at least one tag *before* launching. Helps categorize running processes.
* **Original document**: Upload the source file (Word doc, PDF, etc.) this template was based on.
* **Template tags**: Add tags to organize your templates.
* **Special instructions**: Notes shown right before someone [launches](/products/pro/launching/) a process. Use for key reminders.
* **Webhook settings**: Send automatic notifications to other apps when tasks complete.

:::note[What are webhooks?]
[Webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) let Tallyfy send data to other web apps when something happens - like a task being completed.
:::

### Track template activity

The Activity tab logs every template change - who made it and when.

### Control template permissions

![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-configure-template-permissions.png)

:::note[Important: Template visibility]
To completely hide a template from Standard and Light users, you must restrict **all five** permission types. If any permission is allowed, the template still appears in their view.
:::

#### Make a template publicly visible

You can make templates public so anyone can find them in the [public library](/products/pro/documenting/templates/how-to-make-my-tallyfy-template-public/).

#### Set template permissions

Control who can interact with this template. You can allow everyone or pick specific people or groups.

**Five permission types:**
- **EDIT**: Modify the template
- **READ**: View template details
- **LAUNCH**: Start new processes from the template
- **DUPLICATE**: Copy the template
- **PROCESS READ**: View running processes created from the template

#### Configure one-off task settings

Decide if people can add unplanned [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to running processes. Look for **"Can people add one-off tasks to this process?"**

- **Yes (default)**: Anyone involved can add extra tasks.
- **No**: Nobody can add extra tasks - the process strictly follows defined steps only.

Set this to **No** for compliance or safety procedures that must follow exact steps.

### Export options

This section shows IDs you'll need for integrations or support.

![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-configure-template-tools.png)

*   **Org ID**: Your organization's unique identifier.
*   **Template ID**: This template's unique identifier.

You'll need these when:
*   Contacting Tallyfy support
*   Setting up [integrations](/products/pro/integrations/) with other tools
*   Copying this template to another organization via [Template Importing](/products/pro/documenting/templates/import-feature/)
