## Configure your template settings

When editing a template, clicking the **Settings** button (sometimes shown as **Config**) opens options to customize how your template works, who can use it, and how it's organized.

:::note[Who can change template settings?]
Only [Members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) with the "Administrator" role, or "Standard" members who have been given permission to edit the specific template, can change these settings. "Light" members cannot edit templates or change their settings.
:::

The main areas you can configure are general actions (like copying or archiving), summary details (like descriptions and videos), organization (folders and tags), and access rules (permissions).

### General settings

These are basic actions for managing the template.

#### Duplicate

Makes an exact copy of this template. You can then change the copy without affecting the original. Give the copy a new name, or it will be called "COPY OF - [original template name]".

![Duplicate template](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-configure-template-duplicate.png)

:::note[What doesn't get copied]
When you duplicate a template, any tags or [webhook](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) settings from the original template are *not* copied over to the new one.
:::

#### Archive

Moves the template out of your main library into an archive. Archived templates aren't deleted and can be brought back (restored) later.

#### Print

Creates a version of the template that's easy to print or save as a PDF. See [Print, Download, and Export Templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/print-download-export-templates/) for more details.

#### Folderize

Lets you move the template into a specific folder to keep your library organized. Read more at [Organize Templates into Folders](/products/pro/documenting/templates/organize-templates-into-folders/).

### Summary settings

This section lets you add details and set options for the template.

![Summary settings](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-configure-template-summary.png)

* **Description**: Add notes explaining what the template is for.
* **Status**: Set a status like "Published" or "In Progress" to show if the template is ready to use. This status shows up in the main template library.
* **Internal explanation video URL**: Add a link (URL) to a video explaining the template. If you add a URL, a video icon appears next to the template in the library for others to click.
* **General information**: Shows who created the template, when it was last updated, etc.
* **Force launcher to folderize [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)?**: Turn this ON to make users choose or create a folder *before* they can start a process from this template. This helps keep running processes organized. You can also pick a default folder.
* **Force launcher to tag process?**: Turn this ON to make users add at least one tag (new or existing) to a process *before* they can start it. This helps categorize running processes so they are easier to find later.
* **Original document**: Upload the original file (like a Word doc or PDF) that this template was based on, for reference.
* **Template tags**: Add tags to this template itself to help organize your template library.
* **Special instructions**: Add notes that people will see right before they [launch](/products/pro/launching/) a process from this template. Use this for important reminders or instructions.
* **Webhook settings**: Set up automatic notifications to other apps when tasks in this template are completed.

:::note[What are webhooks?]
[Webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) are a way for Tallyfy to automatically send information to other web applications when something happens (like a task getting completed).
:::

### Activity tracking

The Activity tab shows a history of all changes made to the template, including who made the change and when.

![Activity log](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-configure-template-activity.png)

### Permission settings

This is where you control who can use this template.

![Permission settings](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-configure-template-permissions.png)

#### Public visibility

Make the template public so anyone in the world can see it in the [public library](/products/pro/documenting/templates/how-to-make-my-tallyfy-template-public/).

#### Template permissions

Control who can edit, view, or duplicate this specific template. You can allow everyone in your organization or choose specific people or groups.

#### Process launch permissions

Control who can start new [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) using this template. You can also control who can see the running processes created from this template. You can allow everyone or choose specific people or groups.

#### One-off task settings

Decide if people using this template can add extra, unplanned [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to a running process. Look for the setting **"Can people add one-off tasks to this process?"**

- **Yes (Default)**: Anyone involved can add extra tasks to processes launched from this template.
- **No**: Only Administrators can add extra tasks. Standard and Light members cannot.

Setting this to **No** is useful for processes where you need to strictly follow the defined steps, like for compliance or safety rules.

### Export options

This section shows the IDs needed to identify this specific template.

![Export settings](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-configure-template-tools.png)

*   **Org ID**: Your organization's unique ID.
*   **Template ID**: This template's unique ID.

You might need these IDs when:
*   Contacting Tallyfy support.
*   Setting up [integrations](/products/pro/integrations/) with other tools.
*   Copying this template to a different Tallyfy organization using the [Template Importing](/products/pro/documenting/templates/import-feature/) feature.

This feature is particularly useful for consultants who build templates in one organization for deployment in another.
