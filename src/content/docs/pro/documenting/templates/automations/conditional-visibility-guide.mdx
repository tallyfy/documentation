## Understanding conditional visibility in Tallyfy

You can show or hide tasks in Tallyfy based on what users select in form fields - this is conditional visibility. It creates dynamic workflows where only relevant tasks appear. Simple.

**Key concept**: Conditional visibility in Tallyfy works at the task level - you can show or hide entire tasks, but not individual fields within a form.

## How conditional visibility works

### The basics
Here's what happens: someone fills out a form field, Tallyfy checks your IF-THEN rules[^2], and tasks appear (or stay hidden). You can combine multiple conditions with AND/OR logic. 

One catch - once a task appears, it stays visible unless someone manually hides it.

### Important limitations
- **No field-level conditions**: You can't show/hide individual form fields within a task (just whole tasks). Tallyfy doesn't support conditional logic at the form field level - fields can't appear/disappear based on other field values within the same form
- **Tasks only**: Conditions apply to complete tasks, not sections or fields
- **One-way visibility**: Tasks shown by conditions won't automatically hide if conditions change - they stick around
- **Hidden steps cannot be completed**: Hidden steps remain incomplete indefinitely and can't trigger completion-based automations
- **Same-step field references only**: When creating automation conditions based on form fields, you can only reference fields within the same step. You cannot reference form fields from other steps in your conditions - the dropdown will only show fields from the current step or let you check if other steps are completed/reopened

:::note[Form field conditional logic not supported]
**Looking for form-level conditional logic?** Tallyfy's conditional logic works at the task/step level, not within forms. You can't make form fields appear/disappear based on other field selections in the same form. Instead, use conditional task visibility to show different tasks with different form fields based on earlier selections.

## Setting up conditional visibility

### Prerequisites
- Administrator or Standard user role
- A [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) with form fields
- Understanding of [automation rules](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/)

### Basic setup steps

<Steps>
1. **Create your form fields**: Set up fields in your kick-off form[^1] or early tasks that will trigger conditions

2. **Add tasks to show/hide**: Create all tasks that might be needed in your workflow

3. **Configure visibility rules**:
   - Click on the task you want to conditionally show
   - Go to **Automations** > **Add Rule**
   - Select **Show/Hide Task**
   - Set your IF conditions
   - Choose THEN **Show this task**

4. **Test thoroughly**: Launch test processes to verify all condition paths work correctly
</Steps>

## Practical examples with solutions

### Example 1: Simple Yes/No branching

**Scenario**: You need to show additional documentation tasks only if someone selects "International Shipping"

**Setup**:
```
Kick-off form field: "Shipping Type" (Dropdown)
- Options: Domestic, International

Conditional task: "Customs Documentation"
Rule: IF "Shipping Type" equals "International" THEN show this task
```

### Example 1a: Agency vs. Principal delivery model

**Scenario**: Service company delivers projects either as principal contractor or agency

**Setup**:
```
Kick-off form field: "Delivery Model" (Dropdown)
- Options: Agency, Principal

Conditional tasks for Principal:
- "Obtain contractor licenses"
- "Set up project insurance"
- "Manage subcontractor payments"

Conditional tasks for Agency:
- "Coordinate with client's contractors"
- "Submit agency reports"
- "Process agency fees"

Rules: 
- IF "Delivery Model" equals "Principal" THEN show principal tasks
- IF "Delivery Model" equals "Agency" THEN show agency tasks
```

### Example 2: Multiple AND conditions

**Scenario**: You want manager approval only for purchases over $5,000 from new vendors

**Setup**:
```
Form fields:
- "Purchase Amount" (Number)
- "Vendor Status" (Dropdown: New, Existing)

Conditional task: "Manager Approval Required"
Rule: IF "Purchase Amount" is greater than 5000
      AND "Vendor Status" equals "New"
      THEN show this task
```

**Common mistake**: People often set up separate rules instead of using AND. Don't do that!
- Wrong: Two separate rules (one for amount, one for vendor)
- Right: One rule with both conditions connected by AND

### Example 3: Complex OR conditions

**Scenario**: Show legal review for contracts, NDA, or partnership agreements

**Setup**:
```
Form field: "Document Type" (Dropdown)
- Options: Contract, NDA, Partnership Agreement, Invoice, Purchase Order

Conditional task: "Legal Review"
Rule: IF "Document Type" equals "Contract"
      OR "Document Type" equals "NDA"
      OR "Document Type" equals "Partnership Agreement"
      THEN show this task
```

### Example 4: Questionnaire-style quotation workflow

**Scenario**: Build a dynamic quotation process that asks questions to narrow down options, like a decision tree

**Setup**:
```
Step 1 - Kick-off form:
- "Industry Type" (Dropdown: Manufacturing, Services, Retail)
- "Company Size" (Radio: Small, Medium, Large)

Step 2 - Manufacturing Questions (conditional):
Rule: IF "Industry Type" equals "Manufacturing" THEN show this task
- "Production Volume" (Number)
- "Equipment Needed" (Checklist)

Step 3 - Services Questions (conditional):
Rule: IF "Industry Type" equals "Services" THEN show this task
- "Service Type" (Dropdown)
- "Monthly Hours" (Number)

Step 4 - Small Business Package (conditional):
Rule: IF "Company Size" equals "Small" 
      AND "Industry Type" equals "Manufacturing"
      AND "Production Volume" less than 1000
      THEN show this task

Step 5 - Enterprise Solution (conditional):
Rule: IF "Company Size" equals "Large"
      OR "Production Volume" greater than 10000
      THEN show this task
```

**Result**: The process dynamically reveals only relevant questions based on previous answers, creating a questionnaire flow that leads to the right quotation options.

:::tip[Using kick-off fields for process branching]
**Want one template instead of many?** Use kick-off form fields to control your entire process flow:
1. Add dropdowns/radio buttons to your kick-off form for key decisions
2. Reference these fields in automation rules throughout the template
3. Show/hide entire task groups based on kick-off selections
4. Avoid creating duplicate templates for similar processes

Example: Instead of "Onboarding - US" and "Onboarding - EU" templates, use one template with a "Region" kick-off field that controls which compliance steps appear.

## Troubleshooting common issues

### Issue 1: Multiple conditional paths appearing

**Problem**: User selects "Corporation", sees corporate tasks, then changes to "LLC" but corporate tasks remain visible.

**Why it happens**: Tallyfy doesn't automatically hide previously shown tasks when conditions change. I know, this can be frustrating.

**Solutions**:
1. **Design approach**: Use "Previous task complete" as an additional condition
   ```
   Rule: IF "Business Type" equals "Corporation"
         AND "Select Business Type" is complete
         THEN show corporate tasks
   ```

2. **Manual approach**: Train users to [manually hide tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/manually-show-hide-tasks/) that are no longer relevant

3. **Process design**: Consider using separate templates for significantly different paths

### Issue 2: Conditions not triggering

**Problem**: Tasks don't appear even when conditions are met.

**Common causes and fixes**:
- **Timing**: Make sure the form field is completed before the conditional task's position in the workflow
- **Field references**: Double-check you're referencing the correct field name (case matters!)
- **Logic errors**: Check AND vs OR usage - remember, AND requires all conditions to be true
- **Data types**: Number comparisons need number fields, not text fields

### Issue 3: Hidden steps and completion conditions

**Problem**: Automation rules checking "if step is complete" never trigger for hidden steps.

**Why it happens**: Here's the thing - hidden steps can't be seen or completed by users. That means any automation waiting for them to be complete will wait forever.

**Key points**:
- Hidden steps remain incomplete indefinitely
- Users can't see or complete hidden steps
- Conditions like "IF Step X is complete" will never trigger if Step X is hidden
- The only exception? If Step X has another rule that makes it visible first

**Solutions**:
1. **Avoid dependencies on hidden step completion** - Design your workflow so completion checks only apply to visible steps
2. **Use visibility rules first** - Make steps visible before any completion-based automations depend on them
3. **Alternative conditions** - Check the original condition that would have shown the step, not its completion

### Issue 4: Too many conditions to manage

**Problem**: Workflow has 20+ conditional paths making it hard to maintain.

**Solution approaches**:
1. **Simplify with groups**: Instead of individual conditions, group related tasks
2. **Use sub-processes**: Launch separate processes for complex branches
3. **Redesign the flow**: Sometimes multiple simple templates work better than one complex template

## Best practices for conditional workflows

### 1. Plan before building
Map out all possible paths on paper first. Seriously - grab a pen. Then identify which tasks are always needed versus conditional ones, and group related conditional tasks together.

### 2. Name strategically
Your task names should hint at their conditional nature. Instead of "Corporate Filing", try "Corporate Filing Tasks (if Corporation selected)". Add notes in task descriptions about when they appear - your future self will thank you.

### 3. Test comprehensively
Create test scenarios for every possible path. All of them. Then verify tasks appear in the correct order and check that parallel conditions don't conflict.

### 4. Document for users
Add instructions in your kick-off form about how selections affect the workflow. Include notes in conditional tasks explaining why they appeared. And don't forget - train users on manually hiding irrelevant tasks if needed.

### 5. Maintain simplicity
Here's my rule: limit condition depth (avoid conditions on conditional tasks). Use clear, binary choices when possible. Sometimes multiple simple templates work better than one complex monster.

## Advanced patterns

### Sequential conditional tasks
Want conditional tasks to appear one at a time instead of all at once? Here's how:

```
Task A: "Select Option"
Task B: Shows if Option = X AND Task A is complete
Task C: Shows if Task B is complete AND [additional condition]
```

This keeps your workflow tidy - tasks only appear when they're actually needed.

### Conditional task groups
Group related tasks that share the same condition:

```
If "Department" = "HR" then show:
- Task 1: Collect employee information
- Task 2: Background check
- Task 3: Equipment requisition
- Task 4: IT account setup
```

Set the same condition on all related tasks for consistency.

### Enterprise playbook filtering

**Scenario**: You're running a global services company and need to filter playbooks based on multiple criteria:
- Delivery model (agency vs. principal)
- Service type (fleet, workplace, on-the-go)
- Geographic requirements (North America, Europe, Asia)

**Challenge**: Managing 12-14 variations without creating separate templates. Yes, it gets complex fast.

**Solution approach**:
<Steps>
1. **Create master template** with all possible variations included

2. **Add comprehensive kick-off form** with filtering dropdowns:
   - Delivery Model: Agency/Principal
   - Service Type: Fleet/Workplace/On-the-go
   - Region: NA/EU/APAC

3. **Set up task groups** with clear naming conventions:
   - "[Principal] Fleet Operations - North America"
   - "[Agency] Workplace Setup - Europe"
   - "[Principal] On-the-go Installation - Asia"

4. **Configure visibility rules** for each group:
   ```
   IF Delivery Model = "Principal" 
   AND Service Type = "Fleet"
   AND Region = "North America"
   THEN show: Principal Fleet NA task group
   ```

5. **Test all combinations** systematically
</Steps>

**Managing complexity with 12+ variations**:
- Use consistent naming patterns for easy identification
- Group related tasks under section headers
- Create a visibility matrix document for reference
- Consider using [snippets](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/) for content that appears in multiple variations
- Train users on the filtering logic - they need to understand what's happening

### Default paths
Always include a default path for when no conditions are met. Trust me on this one.

```
If Type = A: Show Task Set A
If Type = B: Show Task Set B
If Type = anything else: Show Task Set C (default)
```

## When to avoid conditional visibility

Sometimes conditional visibility isn't the answer. Consider alternatives when:
- You have more than 5-6 major conditional branches
- Conditions depend on multiple previous selections  
- Users frequently change their initial selections
- Different teams handle different branches

What works better? Try these instead:
- Multiple specialized templates (cleaner, easier to maintain)
- Using the API to launch appropriate sub-processes
- Webhook integrations to external routing logic

## Future enhancement - Slides with conditional logic

:::note[Coming Soon - Q2 2025]
We're building something exciting: a slides feature that makes complex conditional workflows much easier to manage. Instead of showing/hiding individual tasks, you'll create slide-based playbooks where entire slides appear based on user selections. Game-changer.

**How it will work**:
- Create slides with your content (think PowerPoint, but smarter)
- Set IF-THEN rules at the slide level
- Users answer questions at the start
- Only relevant slides appear in their customized playbook

**Perfect for**:
- Enterprise playbooks with many variations
- Training materials that adapt to roles
- Compliance procedures that vary by region
- Any workflow where you currently maintain multiple document versions (we've all been there)
