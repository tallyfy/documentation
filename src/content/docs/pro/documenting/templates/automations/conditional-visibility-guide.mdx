## What conditional visibility does

Show or hide entire tasks based on form field values. Someone fills out a field, Tallyfy checks your IF-THEN rules[^2], and tasks appear or stay hidden. You can combine conditions with AND/OR logic.

This works at the **task level only** - you can't show or hide individual form fields within a task.

### Key limitations

- **Tasks only** - you can't conditionally show/hide individual form fields, just whole tasks
- **One-way visibility** - once a task appears, it stays visible unless someone manually hides it
- **Hidden tasks stay incomplete** - hidden tasks get an "auto-skipped" status and can't trigger completion-based automations
- **Cross-step references allowed** - you can reference kick-off form fields, step completion status, or form fields from any step in your conditions

:::note[Form field conditional logic not supported]
Tallyfy's conditional logic works at the task/step level, not within forms. You can't make form fields appear/disappear based on other field selections in the same form. Instead, use conditional task visibility to show different tasks with different form fields based on earlier selections.
:::

## Setting up conditional visibility

You'll need a Pro plan (or active trial), plus a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) with form fields and [automation rules](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/).

<Steps>
1. **Create your form fields** - add fields in your kick-off form[^1] or early tasks that'll trigger conditions

2. **Add all possible tasks** - create every task that might appear in the workflow

3. **Configure visibility rules** - open the template editor, go to **Automations** > **Add Rule**, select a visibility action, set your IF conditions, then choose THEN **Show this task** or **Hide this task**

4. **Test** - launch test processes to verify all condition paths work
</Steps>

## Practical examples

### Simple Yes/No branching

```
Kick-off form field: "Shipping Type" (Dropdown: Domestic, International)

Conditional task: "Customs Documentation"
Rule: IF "Shipping Type" equals "International" THEN show this task
```

### Multiple AND conditions

```
Form fields:
- "Purchase Amount" (Number)
- "Vendor Status" (Dropdown: New, Existing)

Conditional task: "Manager Approval Required"
Rule: IF "Purchase Amount" is greater than 5000
      AND "Vendor Status" equals "New"
      THEN show this task
```

Don't create two separate rules here. Use one rule with both conditions joined by AND.

### OR conditions

```
Form field: "Document Type" (Dropdown)
Options: Contract, NDA, Partnership Agreement, Invoice, Purchase Order

Conditional task: "Legal Review"
Rule: IF "Document Type" equals "Contract"
      OR "Document Type" equals "NDA"
      OR "Document Type" equals "Partnership Agreement"
      THEN show this task
```

### Decision-tree quotation workflow

```
Step 1 - Kick-off form:
- "Industry Type" (Dropdown: Manufacturing, Services, Retail)
- "Company Size" (Radio: Small, Medium, Large)

Step 2 - Manufacturing Questions (conditional):
Rule: IF "Industry Type" equals "Manufacturing" THEN show this task

Step 3 - Services Questions (conditional):
Rule: IF "Industry Type" equals "Services" THEN show this task

Step 4 - Small Business Package (conditional):
Rule: IF "Company Size" equals "Small"
      AND "Industry Type" equals "Manufacturing"
      THEN show this task

Step 5 - Enterprise Solution (conditional):
Rule: IF "Company Size" equals "Large"
      OR "Production Volume" greater than 10000
      THEN show this task
```

The process reveals only relevant questions based on previous answers.

:::tip[Using kick-off fields for process branching]
Use kick-off form fields to control your entire process flow instead of maintaining multiple templates:
1. Add dropdowns/radio buttons to your kick-off form for key decisions
2. Reference these fields in automation rules throughout the template
3. Show/hide entire task groups based on kick-off selections

Example: Instead of "Onboarding - US" and "Onboarding - EU" templates, use one template with a "Region" kick-off field that controls which compliance steps appear.
:::

## Troubleshooting

### Tasks from previous selections still visible

User selects "Corporation", sees corporate tasks, then changes to "LLC" - but corporate tasks remain.

Tallyfy doesn't auto-hide previously shown tasks. Three workarounds:

1. Add "step is complete" as an extra condition so tasks only appear after the selection step is finished
2. Train users to [manually hide tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/manually-show-hide-tasks/) that aren't relevant
3. Use separate templates for very different paths

### Conditions not triggering

- **Timing** - the form field must be completed before the conditional task's position in the workflow
- **Field references** - double-check you're referencing the correct field (case matters)
- **Logic errors** - AND requires all conditions to be true, OR requires just one
- **Data types** - number comparisons (greater than, less than) need numeric field validation on text fields

### Hidden steps blocking completion-based automations

Hidden tasks have "auto-skipped" status. They can't be completed, so any rule checking "IF Step X is complete" won't trigger if Step X is hidden. Design your workflow so completion checks only target visible steps, or use the original condition that would've shown the step instead.

### Too many conditional paths

If you've got 20+ conditional branches, consider grouping related tasks under shared conditions, launching sub-processes for complex branches, or splitting into multiple simpler templates.

## Best practices

- **Plan first** - map out all paths before building. Identify which tasks are always needed vs. conditional, and group related ones together.
- **Name clearly** - use names like "Corporate Filing Tasks (if Corporation selected)" so it's obvious when tasks appear.
- **Test every path** - launch test processes for each condition combination. Verify tasks appear in the right order.
- **Add context for users** - include notes in conditional tasks explaining why they appeared. Train users on [manually hiding tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/manually-show-hide-tasks/) if needed.
- **Keep it simple** - avoid conditions on conditional tasks. Use binary choices when possible.

## Advanced patterns

### Sequential conditional tasks

Reveal tasks one at a time instead of all at once:

```
Task A: "Select Option"
Task B: Shows if Option = X AND Task A is complete
Task C: Shows if Task B is complete AND [additional condition]
```

### Conditional task groups

Apply the same condition to related tasks:

```
If "Department" = "HR" then show:
- Task 1: Collect employee information
- Task 2: Background check
- Task 3: Equipment requisition
- Task 4: IT account setup
```

### Enterprise playbook filtering

For managing 12+ variations (e.g. by delivery model, service type, and region) without separate templates:

<Steps>
1. **Create a master template** with all variations included

2. **Add kick-off form dropdowns** for Delivery Model, Service Type, Region

3. **Name task groups clearly** - e.g. "[Principal] Fleet Operations - North America"

4. **Configure visibility rules** combining multiple conditions:
   ```
   IF Delivery Model = "Principal"
   AND Service Type = "Fleet"
   AND Region = "North America"
   THEN show: Principal Fleet NA task group
   ```

5. **Test all combinations** systematically
</Steps>

Use [snippets](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/) for content that repeats across variations.

### Default paths

Always include a fallback for when no conditions match:

```
If Type = A: Show Task Set A
If Type = B: Show Task Set B
If Type = anything else: Show Task Set C (default)
```

## When to avoid conditional visibility

Consider alternatives when:
- You have more than 5-6 major conditional branches
- Users frequently change their initial selections
- Different teams handle entirely different branches

Better options: multiple specialized templates, API-launched sub-processes, or webhook integrations to external routing logic.

## Future - Slides with conditional logic

:::note[Coming soon]
A slides feature will let you create slide-based playbooks where entire slides appear based on user selections - instead of showing/hiding individual tasks.

**How it'll work**:
- Create slides with your content
- Set IF-THEN rules at the slide level
- Users answer questions at the start
- Only relevant slides appear in their playbook

**Good for**: enterprise playbooks with many variations, role-based training materials, region-specific compliance procedures.
