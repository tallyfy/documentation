## Process automations in Tallyfy

[Automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) allow your [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) to perform actions and make decisions based on predefined conditions, reducing manual intervention and ensuring consistent execution. As a [workflow automation software](https://tallyfy.com/solutions/workflow-automation-software/), Tallyfy provides the tools you need to create smart, responsive business processes.

### What are automations?

Automations in Tallyfy are rule-based systems that:
- Monitor process conditions and data
- Execute predefined actions when conditions are met
- Make decisions based on process [variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/)
- Route [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) according to logical rules
- Modify process behavior automatically

:::tip[Think of Automations like a Thermostat]
Imagine a simple thermostat controlling your home's heating. You set a rule: **IF** the temperature drops below 68°F (20°C), **THEN** turn on the heat.

Tallyfy automations work on a similar principle. They follow simple "If This, Then That" logic:

- **IF** a certain condition is met within your process (e.g., a form field value is 'Urgent', a task is approved, a deadline passes).
- **THEN** Tallyfy automatically performs a specific action you've defined (e.g., assign the task to a manager, show a specific step, send an email).

This simple logic lets you build intelligent processes that react automatically to different situations.

### Core components of automations

#### 1. Conditions
The "if" part of automation that determines when actions should occur. Conditions can be based on:
- [Form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) values
- [Task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) status changes
- Time-based triggers
- User actions or inactions
- Combinations of multiple factors

#### 2. Actions
The "then" part that executes when conditions are met. Actions include:
- **Assignment Actions** - Control who handles [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) by adding assignees, replacing existing assignees, or clearing all assignees. Can use the "Assignee Picker" field type as input for dynamic assignments.
- **Deadline Actions** - Set or adjust task deadlines, using either fixed shifts, other step deadlines, or dates from "Date" field types as inputs.
- **Status Actions** - Re-open completed [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) based on conditions, primarily used for approval processes and feedback loops. Only affects tasks that are currently complete.
- **Visibility Actions** - Show or hide specific steps based on conditions, creating dynamic process paths. This is the most popular action type in Tallyfy.

### Best practices for naming automations

When creating automations, always use descriptive names that clearly explain what the automation does:

- **Be specific and clear** - Name your automation based on its purpose (e.g., "Only for part-time employees" instead of "Staff automation")
- **Include the main condition** - Reference the key trigger in the name (e.g., "Show bonus step for VIP clients")
- **Make it understandable to others** - Name automations as if someone else will need to understand them without your explanation
- **Avoid generic names** - Don't use names like "Automation 1" or "Step 2 rule" that provide no context

Descriptive naming is especially important in collaborative environments where multiple people may need to understand, modify, or troubleshoot automations created by others.

### Benefits of using automations

- **Consistency** - Ensure [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) follow the same rules every time
- **Efficiency** - Eliminate manual decision points and [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) assignments
- **Scalability** - Handle complex decision logic without additional staff
- **Error reduction** - Remove human error from routine process decisions
- **Adaptability** - Create dynamic [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) that respond to specific inputs
