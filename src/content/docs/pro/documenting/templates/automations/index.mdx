## Process automations in Tallyfy

Automations allow your processes to perform actions and make decisions based on predefined conditions, reducing manual intervention and ensuring consistent execution.

### What are automations?

Automations in Tallyfy are rule-based systems that:
- Monitor process conditions and data
- Execute predefined actions when conditions are met
- Make decisions based on process variables
- Route tasks according to logical rules
- Modify process behavior automatically

### Core components of automations

#### 1. Conditions
The "if" part of automation that determines when actions should occur. Conditions can be based on:
- Form field values
- Task status changes
- Time-based triggers
- User actions or inactions
- Combinations of multiple factors

#### 2. Actions
The "then" part that executes when conditions are met. Actions include:
- Assigning tasks to specific people
- Setting or adjusting deadlines
- Changing task status
- Controlling task visibility
- Skipping or activating steps
- Sending notifications

### Benefits of using automations

- **Consistency** - Ensure processes follow the same rules every time
- **Efficiency** - Eliminate manual decision points and task assignments
- **Scalability** - Handle complex decision logic without additional staff
- **Error reduction** - Remove human error from routine process decisions
- **Adaptability** - Create dynamic processes that respond to specific inputs
