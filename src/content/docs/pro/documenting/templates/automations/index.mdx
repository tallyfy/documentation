## Process automations in Tallyfy

Automations allow your processes to perform actions and make decisions based on predefined conditions, reducing manual intervention and ensuring consistent execution.

### What are automations?

Automations in Tallyfy are rule-based systems that:
- Monitor process conditions and data
- Execute predefined actions when conditions are met
- Make decisions based on process variables
- Route tasks according to logical rules
- Modify process behavior automatically

:::note[Automations vs. Flowcharts]
Tallyfy's rule-based automations replace traditional flowcharts with a more practical approach. Unlike flowcharts that are visual but not executable, Tallyfy automations can be immediately run and tracked. This approach eliminates the complexity of visual diagrams that often become overwhelming and difficult to maintain, while providing all the decision-making power your processes need.

### Core components of automations

#### 1. Conditions
The "if" part of automation that determines when actions should occur. Conditions can be based on:
- Form field values
- Task status changes
- Time-based triggers
- User actions or inactions
- Combinations of multiple factors

#### 2. Actions
The "then" part that executes when conditions are met. Actions include:
- Assigning tasks to specific people
- Setting or adjusting deadlines
- Changing task status
- Controlling task visibility
- Skipping or activating steps
- Sending notifications

### Benefits of using automations

- **Consistency** - Ensure processes follow the same rules every time
- **Efficiency** - Eliminate manual decision points and task assignments
- **Scalability** - Handle complex decision logic without additional staff
- **Error reduction** - Remove human error from routine process decisions
- **Adaptability** - Create dynamic processes that respond to specific inputs
