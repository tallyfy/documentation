## Understanding process automations

Tallyfy automations transform static workflows into intelligent processes that adapt in real-time based on user input. You'll create IF-THEN rules that automatically route tasks, adjust deadlines, and show or hide steps - each process instance follows the right path for its specific situation. For AI-powered automation that can complete tasks and make decisions, see our upcoming [BYO AI integration](/products/pro/integrations/byo-ai/) that connects your existing AI subscriptions.

### How automations work

Here's what makes Tallyfy automations powerful. They create smart processes that:
- Ask for user input through form fields, then modify the workflow based on responses
- Watch what's happening in a process (data entered, tasks completed, you name it)
- Perform actions automatically when certain conditions are met
- Make intelligent decisions based on captured information
- Route tasks to the right people based on user input
- Show or hide steps dynamically - your conditions, your rules

:::tip[Think of Automations like a Thermostat]
Your home thermostat follows a simple rule: **IF** the temperature goes below a set point, **THEN** turn on the heat.

Tallyfy automations use the same simple "if-this-then-that" idea:

- **IF** something specific happens in your process (like a form answer is 'Urgent', a task gets approved, or a deadline is missed).
- **THEN** Tallyfy automatically does an action you set up (like assign a task to a manager, show a hidden step, or send an email).

This lets you build workflows that adapt automatically to each unique situation.

:::tip[Automations: Like a "Choose Your Own Adventure" Story]
Another way to think about automations is like a "choose your own adventure" story.

- Just like in those stories where your choices determine the plot, your smart process asks for user input and modifies the flow based on that input
- For example, if a customer selects 'Complaint' as a support ticket type (the user input), the automation can route the ticket to a specialized team and trigger a high-priority notification (the modified flow). If they select 'Feature Request', it might go to a product team backlog
- This means one [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) handles multiple scenarios automatically, guiding each [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) down the right path based on real-time user responses

### Automation rule components

Every automation rule has two parts. Simple as that.

#### Conditions (the "IF" part)
This is your trigger - it tells the automation *when* to run. Conditions check things like:
- Answers in [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) (what users actually type or select)
- Whether a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) gets completed or approved
- Time passing - maybe 3 days since a task started
- What users do (or don't do)
- Multiple inputs combined - this gets interesting

#### Actions (the "THEN" part)
Here's where the magic happens. When conditions are met, Tallyfy automatically:
- **Assignment Actions**: Switches who a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) goes to based on user responses
- **Deadline Actions**: Sets or adjusts task deadlines using user input or dates from form fields
- **Status Actions**: Re-opens completed [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) (perfect for approval workflows)
- **Visibility Actions**: Shows or hides steps based on user input - your process adapts to each situation

### Naming automation rules

Your automation names matter - they're what your team sees every day. Here's how to nail it:

- **Be specific**: "Show steps for USA customers only" beats "Customer rule" every time
- **Hint at the condition**: Include the trigger if you can ("Assign to manager if urgent")
- **Write for others**: Your teammates should get it instantly
- **Skip the generic stuff**: "Rule 1" or "Automation for step 5" won't help anyone

Good names mean less confusion, faster updates, and easier troubleshooting. Worth the extra thought.

### Benefits of using automations

Why bother with automations? Here's what you gain:

- **Smart adaptation**: Workflows that actually listen to user input and adjust accordingly
- **Rock-solid consistency**: Every process follows the same logic. No exceptions.
- **Time savings**: Those routing decisions that eat up hours? Automated.
- **Complexity made simple**: Sophisticated business rules run themselves - no manual juggling
- **Error reduction**: Can't mis-route a task when the system handles it automatically
- **Real-time flexibility**: Processes that adapt on the fly to whatever comes their way
