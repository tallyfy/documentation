## Understanding process automations

Tallyfy automations transform static workflows into intelligent processes that adapt in real-time based on user input. Create IF-THEN rules that automatically route tasks, adjust deadlines, and show or hide steps - ensuring each process instance follows the right path for its specific situation.

### How automations work

Automations in Tallyfy create smart processes that:
- Ask for user input through form fields and then modify the workflow based on responses
- Watch what's happening in a process (like data entered or tasks completed)
- Automatically perform actions when certain conditions are met
- Make intelligent decisions based on information captured in the process
- Direct tasks to the right people based on user input
- Dynamically show or hide steps based on conditions you define

:::tip[Think of Automations like a Thermostat]
Your home thermostat follows a simple rule: **IF** the temperature goes below a set point, **THEN** turn on the heat.

Tallyfy automations use the same simple "if-this-then-that" idea:

- **IF** something specific happens in your process (like a form answer is 'Urgent', a task gets approved, or a deadline is missed).
- **THEN** Tallyfy automatically does an action you set up (like assign a task to a manager, show a hidden step, or send an email).

This lets you build workflows that adapt automatically to each unique situation.

:::tip[Automations: Like a "Choose Your Own Adventure" Story]
Another way to think about automations is like a "choose your own adventure" story.

- Just like in those stories where your choices determine the plot, your smart process asks for user input and modifies the flow based on that input
- For example, if a customer selects 'Complaint' as a support ticket type (the user input), the automation can route the ticket to a specialized team and trigger a high-priority notification (the modified flow). If they select 'Feature Request', it might go to a product team backlog
- This means one [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) handles multiple scenarios automatically, guiding each [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) down the right path based on real-time user responses

### Automation rule components

Every automation rule has two main parts:

#### Conditions (the "IF" part)
This is the trigger that tells the automation *when* to run. Conditions check user input and other factors like:
- Answers given in [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) (user input)
- Whether a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) is completed or approved
- If a certain amount of time has passed
- Actions users take (or don't take)
- A mix of different user inputs combined

#### Actions (the "THEN" part)
This defines what Tallyfy automatically does when conditions are met. Common actions include:
- **Assignment Actions**: Change who a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) is assigned to based on user responses
- **Deadline Actions**: Set or change task deadlines based on user input or dates in form fields
- **Status Actions**: Re-open a completed [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) (often used for approvals)
- **Visibility Actions**: Show or hide steps based on user input (creating smart processes that adapt to different paths)

### Naming automation rules

Give your automation rules clear names so everyone understands what they do:

- **Be specific**: Name the rule after its purpose (e.g., "Show steps for USA customers only" is better than "Customer rule").
- **Hint at the condition**: Include the main trigger in the name if possible (e.g., "Assign to manager if urgent").
- **Write for others**: Name rules so team members understand them instantly.
- **Avoid vague names**: Skip generic labels like "Rule 1" or "Automation for step 5".

Clear naming helps your team understand, update, and troubleshoot automations quickly.

### Benefits of using automations

- **Smart adaptation**: Build workflows that collect user input and adjust their path accordingly
- **Consistency**: Every process instance follows the same logic automatically
- **Efficiency**: Save hours by automating routing decisions based on user data
- **Handle complexity**: Manage sophisticated business rules without manual work
- **Fewer errors**: Eliminate routing mistakes with automatic condition-based assignment
- **Dynamic workflows**: Create processes that adapt in real-time to each scenario
