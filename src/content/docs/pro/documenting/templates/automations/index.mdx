## Process automations in Tallyfy

[Automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) allow your [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) to perform actions and make decisions based on predefined conditions, reducing manual intervention and ensuring consistent execution. As a powerful [workflow automation software](https://tallyfy.com/solutions/workflow-automation-software/), Tallyfy provides the tools you need to create smart, responsive business processes.

### What are automations?

Automations in Tallyfy are rule-based systems that:
- Monitor process conditions and data
- Execute predefined actions when conditions are met
- Make decisions based on process [variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/)
- Route [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) according to logical rules
- Modify process behavior automatically

:::note[Automations vs. Flowcharts]
Tallyfy's rule-based automations replace traditional flowcharts with a more practical approach. Unlike flowcharts that are visual but not executable, Tallyfy automations can be immediately run and tracked. This approach eliminates the complexity of visual diagrams that often become overwhelming and difficult to maintain, while providing all the decision-making power your processes need.

### Core components of automations

#### 1. Conditions
The "if" part of automation that determines when actions should occur. Conditions can be based on:
- [Form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) values
- [Task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) status changes
- Time-based triggers
- User actions or inactions
- Combinations of multiple factors

#### 2. Actions
The "then" part that executes when conditions are met. Actions include:
- **Assignment Actions** - Control who handles [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) by adding assignees, replacing existing assignees, or clearing all assignees. Can use the "Assignee Picker" field type as input for dynamic assignments.
- **Deadline Actions** - Set or adjust task deadlines, using either fixed shifts, other step deadlines, or dates from "Date" field types as inputs.
- **Status Actions** - Re-open completed [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) based on conditions, primarily used for approval processes and feedback loops. Only affects tasks that are currently complete.
- **Visibility Actions** - Show or hide specific steps based on conditions, creating dynamic process paths. This is the most popular action type in Tallyfy.

### Best practices for naming automations

When creating automations, always use descriptive names that clearly explain what the automation does:

- **Be specific and clear** - Name your automation based on its purpose (e.g., "Only for part-time employees" instead of "Staff automation")
- **Include the main condition** - Reference the key trigger in the name (e.g., "Show bonus step for VIP clients")
- **Make it understandable to others** - Name automations as if someone else will need to understand them without your explanation
- **Avoid generic names** - Don't use names like "Automation 1" or "Step 2 rule" that provide no context

Descriptive naming is especially important in collaborative environments where multiple people may need to understand, modify, or troubleshoot automations created by others.

### Benefits of using automations

- **Consistency** - Ensure [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) follow the same rules every time
- **Efficiency** - Eliminate manual decision points and [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) assignments
- **Scalability** - Handle complex decision logic without additional staff
- **Error reduction** - Remove human error from routine process decisions
- **Adaptability** - Create dynamic [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) that respond to specific inputs
