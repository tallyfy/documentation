## What are automations?

Tallyfy automations are IF-THEN rules you add to a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). They make each [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) adapt based on what users enter in [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) and what happens to [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/). No manual routing needed. For AI-powered task completion, see [BYO AI integration](/products/pro/integrations/byo-ai/).

:::tip[Think of automations like a thermostat]
Your thermostat follows a simple rule: **IF** temperature drops below a set point, **THEN** turn on the heat.

Tallyfy automations work the same way:

- **IF** something happens in your process (a form answer is "Urgent", a task gets approved, or a step expires)
- **THEN** Tallyfy fires an action (assign a task to a manager, show a hidden step, or trigger a webhook)
:::

:::tip[Automations are like "choose your own adventure"]
A customer selects "Complaint" as a support ticket type - the automation routes it to a specialized team. They pick "Feature Request" instead - it goes to the product backlog. One [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) handles multiple scenarios, guiding each [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) down the right path.

### Rule components

Every automation rule has two parts: conditions and actions.

#### Conditions (the "IF" part)

Conditions tell the automation *when* to fire. Two categories:

**Step conditions** - based on what happens to a task:
- Task completed, reopened, approved, rejected, acknowledged, or expired
- Task not assigned

**Form field conditions** - based on data entered in step form fields or kick-off form fields:
- Contains / doesn't contain a value
- Equals / doesn't equal a value
- Equals any of several values
- Greater than / less than (for numbers)
- Is empty / isn't empty

You can combine multiple conditions with AND/OR logic.

#### Actions (the "THEN" part)

When conditions are met, Tallyfy fires one or more actions on a target step:

- **Visibility** - show or hide a step
- **Assignment** - assign, unassign, replace assignees, or clear all assignees on a task
- **Deadline** - set a deadline before or after the trigger point, in minutes, hours, days, weeks, or months
- **Status** - reopen a completed task (useful for approval loops)
- **Webhook** - send an HTTP request to an external URL when conditions are met

:::note
Visibility and deadline actions can only target each step once within a single automation rule.

### Naming your rules

Good names save time when debugging. Be specific:

- "Show steps for USA customers only" beats "Customer rule"
- "Assign to manager if urgent" beats "Rule 1"
