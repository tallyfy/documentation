## Understanding process automations

[Automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) enable you to build smart processes that will ask for user input and modify the flow based on that input. These intelligent rules automatically perform actions when specific conditions are met, ensuring your processes adapt dynamically to different scenarios.

### How automations work

Automations in Tallyfy create smart processes that:
- Ask for user input through form fields and then modify the workflow based on responses
- Watch what's happening in a process (like data entered or tasks completed)
- Automatically perform actions when certain conditions are met
- Make intelligent decisions based on information captured in the process
- Direct tasks to the right people based on user input
- Dynamically show or hide steps based on the specific situation

:::tip[Think of Automations like a Thermostat]
Your home thermostat follows a simple rule: **IF** the temperature goes below a set point, **THEN** turn on the heat.

Tallyfy automations use the same simple "if-this-then-that" idea:

- **IF** something specific happens in your process (like a form answer is 'Urgent', a task gets approved, or a deadline is missed).
- **THEN** Tallyfy automatically does an action you set up (like assign a task to a manager, show a hidden step, or send an email).

This lets you build processes that react automatically to different situations.

:::tip[Automations: Like a "Choose Your Own Adventure" Story]
Another way to think about automations is like a "choose your own adventure" story.

- Just like in those stories where your choices determine the plot, your smart process asks for user input and modifies the flow based on that input
- For example, if a customer selects 'Complaint' as a support ticket type (the user input), the automation can route the ticket to a specialized team and trigger a high-priority notification (the modified flow). If they select 'Feature Request', it might go to a product team backlog
- This allows one [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) to dynamically adapt to many different scenarios, guiding each [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) down the right path automatically based on user responses

### Automation rule components

Every automation rule has two main parts:

#### Conditions (the "IF" part)
This is the trigger that tells the automation *when* to run. Conditions check user input and other factors like:
- Answers given in [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) (user input)
- Whether a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) is completed or approved
- If a certain amount of time has passed
- Actions users take (or don't take)
- A mix of different user inputs combined

#### Actions (the "THEN" part)
This is what Tallyfy automatically does to modify the flow based on user input. Common actions include:
- **Assignment Actions**: Change who a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) is assigned to based on user responses
- **Deadline Actions**: Set or change task deadlines based on user input or dates in form fields
- **Status Actions**: Re-open a completed [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) (often used for approvals)
- **Visibility Actions**: Show or hide steps based on user input (creating smart processes that adapt to different paths)

### Naming automation rules

Give your automation rules clear names so everyone understands what they do:

- **Be specific**: Name the rule after its purpose (e.g., "Show steps for USA customers only" is better than "Customer rule").
- **Hint at the condition**: Include the main trigger in the name if possible (e.g., "Assign to manager if urgent").
- **Write for others**: Imagine someone else needs to understand the rule just by reading its name.
- **Avoid vague names**: Don't use names like "Rule 1" or "Automation for step 5".

Good names are important so that you and your team can easily understand, update, or fix automations later.

### Benefits of using automations

- **Smart adaptation**: Build processes that ask for user input and modify their flow accordingly
- **Consistency**: Makes sure the process follows the same logic every time
- **Efficiency**: Saves time by automating decisions based on user input
- **Handle complexity**: Manages complex rules without needing manual intervention
- **Fewer errors**: Reduces mistakes by automatically routing based on user responses
- **Dynamic workflows**: Creates smart processes that adapt based on the situation and user input
