## Process automations in Tallyfy

[Automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) are rules you can set up in your Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). They make the process automatically do certain things or make decisions based on conditions you define. This reduces manual work and makes sure the process runs the same way every time.

### What are automations?

Automations in Tallyfy are like smart rules that:
- Watch what's happening in a process (like data entered or tasks completed).
- Automatically perform actions when certain conditions are met.
- Make decisions based on information in the process ([variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/)).
- Send [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to the right people based on rules.
- Change how the process works on the fly.

:::tip[Think of Automations like a Thermostat]
Your home thermostat follows a simple rule: **IF** the temperature goes below a set point, **THEN** turn on the heat.

Tallyfy automations use the same simple "If This, Then That" idea:

- **IF** something specific happens in your process (like a form answer is 'Urgent', a task gets approved, or a deadline is missed).
- **THEN** Tallyfy automatically does an action you set up (like assign a task to a manager, show a hidden step, or send an email).

This lets you build processes that react automatically to different situations.

### The main parts of an automation rule

Every automation rule has two main parts:

#### 1. Conditions (The "IF" part)
This is the trigger that tells the automation *when* to run. Conditions check things like:
- Answers given in [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/).
- Whether a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) is completed or approved.
- If a certain amount of time has passed.
- Actions users take (or don't take).
- A mix of different factors combined.

#### 2. Actions (The "THEN" part)
This is what Tallyfy automatically does when the condition is met. Common actions include:
- **Assignment Actions**: Change who a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) is assigned to (add someone, replace someone, remove everyone).
- **Deadline Actions**: Set or change task deadlines based on rules or dates in form fields.
- **Status Actions**: Re-open a completed [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) (often used for approvals).
- **Visibility Actions**: Show or hide steps based on conditions (very common for creating different paths in a process).

### Tips for naming your automation rules

Give your automation rules clear names so everyone understands what they do:

- **Be specific**: Name the rule after its purpose (e.g., "Show steps for USA customers only" is better than "Customer rule").
- **Hint at the condition**: Include the main trigger in the name if possible (e.g., "Assign to manager if urgent").
- **Write for others**: Imagine someone else needs to understand the rule just by reading its name.
- **Avoid vague names**: Don't use names like "Rule 1" or "Automation for step 5".

Good names are important so that you and your team can easily understand, update, or fix automations later.

### Why use automations?

- **Consistency**: Makes sure the process follows the same logic every time.
- **Efficiency**: Saves time by automating decisions and task assignments.
- **Handle complexity**: Manages complex rules without needing more people.
- **Fewer Errors**: Reduces mistakes caused by manual steps.
- **Flexibility**: Creates processes that adapt based on the situation.
