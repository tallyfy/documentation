## Understanding automation logic

Tallyfy's [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) use a simple logic system to build smart processes that will ask for user input and modify the flow based on that input. These rules automatically adapt your workflows to different scenarios, ensuring nothing falls through the cracks.

:::tip[Why Tallyfy uses simple logic instead of flowcharts]
We chose simple "if-this-then-that" logic instead of flowcharts on purpose. Flowcharts can get very complicated and hard to understand or change, especially for big processes. Simple "if-this-then-that" rules are easy for *anyone* to understand and use, even without technical training. This approach lets you build smart processes that ask for user input and modify their flow based on responses, handling different situations automatically.
:::

### Basic "IF... THEN..." structure

All [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) follow this basic idea:

```
IF [something is true]
THEN [do this action]
```

This works just like decisions you make every day:

#### The condition (IF part)
The condition is the trigger that checks user input and other process data. It watches for specific responses or situations.

**Examples:**
- IF a user selects "Urgent" in a [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/)
- IF a customer chooses "Premium Service" level
- IF a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) is approved by a manager
- IF user input indicates special requirements

#### The action (THEN part)
The action is how your smart process modifies its flow based on the user input.

**Examples:**
- THEN show additional steps for urgent handling
- THEN assign the [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to a specialist team
- THEN adjust deadlines based on service level
- THEN hide steps that aren't relevant to this user's situation

### Combining multiple conditions

Smart processes often need to evaluate multiple user inputs before modifying the flow. Tallyfy lets you combine conditions using **AND** or **OR**:

#### Using AND logic
AND means **ALL** conditions must be true for the action to happen.

```
IF [condition 1 is true] AND [condition 2 is true]
THEN [do this action]
```

**Example:**
IF the user selects urgent priority (condition 1)
AND the amount entered is over $1000 (condition 2)
THEN modify the flow to include executive approval

#### Using OR logic
OR means **AT LEAST ONE** of the conditions must be true for the action to happen.

```
IF [condition 1 is true] OR [condition 2 is true]
THEN [do this action]
```

**Example:**
IF the client selects VIP service (user input 1)
OR the order amount exceeds $5000 (user input 2)
THEN modify the flow to show premium processing steps

### Combining AND and OR logic

While the automation designer doesn't show explicit parentheses in the UI, Tallyfy evaluates conditions **sequentially from left to right** in the order they appear.

#### How evaluation works

When you create a rule like:
```
IF [condition 1] AND [condition 2] OR [condition 3]
THEN [do this action]
```

Tallyfy processes these conditions in sequence:
1. First evaluates condition 1
2. Then evaluates condition 2 (if condition 1 is true for AND)
3. Finally evaluates condition 3 (if needed for OR)

This means the action will trigger if:
- Both condition 1 AND condition 2 are true, **OR**
- Condition 3 is true by itself

**Note:** Unlike some programming languages, Tallyfy does not apply operator precedence (where AND would be evaluated before OR). Conditions are simply evaluated in the order you add them.

#### Best practice for complex logic

For complex nesting requirements, create multiple separate automation rules instead of combining everything into one rule. This approach:
- Makes your logic clearer and easier to understand
- Simplifies troubleshooting and maintenance
- Avoids confusion about evaluation order

This flexibility lets you build smart processes that ask for user input at key points and intelligently modify their flow to match your specific business needs.
