## Understanding automation logic in Tallyfy

Tallyfy's automation system uses a structured logical framework to create rules that determine when and how automated actions occur in your processes.

### Basic IF-THEN structure

All automations follow the same fundamental pattern:

```
IF [condition]
THEN [action]
```

This pattern mirrors logical decision-making in everyday life and business processes:

#### Condition component (IF)
The condition defines when the automation should trigger. It evaluates to either true or false based on process data.

**Examples:**
- IF a form field contains a specific value
- IF a deadline is approaching
- IF a task status changes

#### Action component (THEN)
The action defines what happens when the condition is true. This is the automated response the system takes.

**Examples:**
- THEN assign a task to a specific person
- THEN change a task's status
- THEN make a task visible or hidden

### Combining multiple conditions

Most real-world automation scenarios require evaluating multiple factors. Tallyfy provides two logical operators for combining conditions:

#### AND operator
The AND operator requires ALL conditions to be true for the action to execute.

```
IF [condition 1] AND [condition 2] AND [condition 3]
THEN [action]
```

**Example:**
IF the customer request is urgent (condition 1)
AND the request value exceeds $1000 (condition 2)
AND it's during business hours (condition 3)
THEN assign the task to a manager

#### OR operator
The OR operator requires ANY condition to be true for the action to execute.

```
IF [condition 1] OR [condition 2]
THEN [action]
```

**Example:**
IF the client is VIP status (condition 1)
OR the order value exceeds $5000 (condition 2)
THEN enable the expedited shipping option

### Complex logic combinations

Tallyfy allows nesting conditions to create more sophisticated automation rules:

```
IF [condition 1] AND ([condition 2] OR [condition 3])
THEN [action]
```

This flexibility enables you to model complex business rules and decision processes in your workflows.
