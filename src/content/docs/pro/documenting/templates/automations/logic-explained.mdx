## Understanding automation logic in Tallyfy

Tallyfy's [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) system uses a structured logical framework to create rules that determine when and how automated actions occur in your [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).

:::tip[Why Tallyfy uses if-then logic instead of flowcharts]
Tallyfy deliberately avoids complex flowcharts in favor of simple if-then logic. While flowcharts become difficult to understand, maintain, and execute as [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) grow more complex, if-then rules remain intuitive for all users regardless of technical background. This approach allows anyone to create and modify process logic without specialized training, while still handling all the scenarios flowcharts would cover.
:::

### Basic if-then structure

All [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) follow the same fundamental pattern:

```
IF [condition]
THEN [action]
```

This pattern mirrors logical decision-making in everyday life and business [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/):

#### Condition component (if)
The condition defines when the [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) should trigger. It evaluates to either true or false based on process data.

**Examples:**
- IF a [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) contains a specific value
- IF a deadline is approaching
- IF a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) status changes

#### Action component (then)
The action defines what happens when the condition is true. This is the automated response the system takes.

**Examples:**
- THEN assign a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to a specific person
- THEN change a task's status
- THEN make a task visible or hidden

### Combining multiple conditions

Most real-world [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) scenarios require evaluating multiple factors. Tallyfy provides two logical operators for combining conditions:

#### AND operator
The AND operator requires ALL conditions to be true for the action to execute.

```
IF [condition 1] AND [condition 2] AND [condition 3]
THEN [action]
```

**Example:**
IF the customer request is urgent (condition 1)
AND the request value exceeds $1000 (condition 2)
AND it's during business hours (condition 3)
THEN assign the [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to a manager

#### OR operator
The OR operator requires ANY condition to be true for the action to execute.

```
IF [condition 1] OR [condition 2]
THEN [action]
```

**Example:**
IF the client is VIP status (condition 1)
OR the order value exceeds $5000 (condition 2)
THEN enable the expedited shipping option

### Complex logic combinations

Tallyfy allows nesting conditions to create more sophisticated [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) rules:

```
IF [condition 1] AND ([condition 2] OR [condition 3])
THEN [action]
```

This flexibility enables you to model complex business rules and decision processes in your workflows.
