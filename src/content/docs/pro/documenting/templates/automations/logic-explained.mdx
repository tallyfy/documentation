## Understanding automation logic in Tallyfy

Tallyfy's [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) use a simple logic system to create rules. These rules decide when automatic actions should happen in your [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).

:::tip[Why Tallyfy uses simple logic instead of flowcharts]
We chose simple "if-then" logic instead of flowcharts on purpose. Flowcharts can get very complicated and hard to understand or change, especially for big processes. Simple "if-then" rules are easy for *anyone* to understand and use, even without technical training. This approach lets you build smart processes that handle different situations without needing complex diagrams.
:::

### The basic "IF... THEN..." rule

All [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) follow this basic idea:

```
IF [something is true]
THEN [do this action]
```

This works just like decisions you make every day:

#### The Condition (the IF part)
The condition is the trigger. It checks if something in the process is true or false.

**Examples:**
- IF a [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) answer is "Yes"
- IF a deadline is near
- IF a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) is approved

#### The Action (the THEN part)
The action is what Tallyfy automatically does *when* the condition is true.

**Examples:**
- THEN assign the [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to the manager
- THEN mark the task as complete
- THEN show or hide the next step

### Using multiple conditions together

Often, you need to check more than one thing before an action happens. Tallyfy lets you combine conditions using **AND** or **OR**:

#### Using AND
AND means **ALL** conditions must be true for the action to happen.

```
IF [condition 1 is true] AND [condition 2 is true]
THEN [do this action]
```

**Example:**
IF the request is urgent (condition 1)
AND the amount is over $1000 (condition 2)
THEN assign the [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to the finance manager

#### Using OR
OR means **AT LEAST ONE** of the conditions must be true for the action to happen.

```
IF [condition 1 is true] OR [condition 2 is true]
THEN [do this action]
```

**Example:**
IF the client has a VIP account (condition 1)
OR the order is over $5000 (condition 2)
THEN show the "Offer Discount" step

### Combining AND and OR

You can mix AND and OR using parentheses `()` to create more complex rules, just like in math:

```
IF [condition 1 is true] AND ([condition 2 is true] OR [condition 3 is true])
THEN [do this action]
```

This flexibility lets you build rules that match your specific business needs.
