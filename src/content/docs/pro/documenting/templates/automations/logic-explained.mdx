## Understanding automation logic

Tallyfy's [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) work like smart decision-makers - they watch what users enter and automatically adjust your workflow accordingly. Simple logic rules adapt your processes to different scenarios. Nothing falls through the cracks.

:::tip[Why Tallyfy uses simple logic instead of flowcharts]
We chose simple "if-this-then-that" logic instead of flowcharts on purpose. Flowcharts can get very complicated and hard to understand or change, especially for big processes. Simple "if-this-then-that" rules are easy for *anyone* to understand and use, even without technical training. This approach lets you build smart processes that ask for user input and modify their flow based on responses, handling different situations automatically.
:::

### Basic "IF... THEN..." structure

All [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) follow this basic idea:

```
IF [something is true]
THEN [do this action]
```

You already think this way every day. It's natural.

#### The condition (IF part)
The condition is your automation's trigger - it checks what users enter and watches for specific responses. Think of it as your workflow's eyes and ears.

**Examples:**
- IF a user selects "Urgent" in a [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/)
- IF a customer chooses "Premium Service" level
- IF a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) is approved by a manager
- IF user input indicates special requirements

#### The action (THEN part)
Here's where the magic happens. Your process changes its behavior based on what users tell it.

**Examples:**
- THEN show additional steps for urgent handling
- THEN assign the [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to a specialist team
- THEN adjust deadlines based on service level
- THEN hide steps that aren't relevant to this user's situation

### Combining multiple conditions

Real business decisions rarely depend on just one thing. Your processes shouldn't either. Tallyfy lets you combine conditions using **AND** or **OR** - just like you'd explain rules to a colleague.

#### Using AND logic
AND means **ALL** conditions must be true. Everything needs to line up.

```
IF [condition 1 is true] AND [condition 2 is true]
THEN [do this action]
```

**Example:**
IF the user selects urgent priority (condition 1)
AND the amount entered is over $1000 (condition 2)
THEN modify the flow to include executive approval

Makes sense, right? Big urgent requests need extra attention.

#### Using OR logic
OR means **AT LEAST ONE** condition needs to be true. More flexible.

```
IF [condition 1 is true] OR [condition 2 is true]
THEN [do this action]
```

**Example:**
IF the client selects VIP service (user input 1)
OR the order amount exceeds $5000 (user input 2)
THEN modify the flow to show premium processing steps

Either way, they get the white-glove treatment.

### Combining AND and OR logic

Now here's where it gets interesting. You might wonder - what happens when you mix AND with OR? Tallyfy keeps it simple by evaluating conditions **sequentially from left to right**, exactly in the order you add them.

#### How evaluation works

When you create a rule like:
```
IF [condition 1] AND [condition 2] OR [condition 3]
THEN [do this action]
```

Tallyfy reads it like a sentence:
1. First checks condition 1
2. If that's true, checks condition 2 (needed for the AND)
3. If either path fails, checks condition 3 (the OR gives you another chance)

The action triggers if:
- Both condition 1 AND condition 2 are true, **OR**
- Condition 3 is true by itself

Simple.

**Note:** Unlike some programming languages, Tallyfy doesn't use operator precedence (where AND would be evaluated before OR). We process conditions in the order you add them - straightforward and predictable.

#### Best practice for complex logic

Got really complex requirements? Don't try to cram everything into one massive rule. Break it up. Create multiple separate automation rules instead.

Why? This approach:
- Makes your logic clearer and easier to understand
- Simplifies troubleshooting and maintenance  
- Avoids confusion about evaluation order

Trust me on this one - your future self will thank you when you need to update these automations six months from now.

The bottom line? Tallyfy gives you the flexibility to build processes that actually think. They ask for user input at just the right moments and adapt their flow to match what's really happening in your business.
