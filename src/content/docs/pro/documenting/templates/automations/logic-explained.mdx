## What are logic operations in Tallyfy automations

Our automation system uses the **"If-Then"** principle to allow you to automate decision-making in your processes based on certain conditions that you can configure!, This concept is much like decision-making in our everyday lives. Here's how it works:

- **IF statement**

  - This is a condition or a trigger event. It's something that may or may not occur. We will call everything under **IF** the **Condition**.
    > > If it's raining outside(Condition).

- **THEN statement**
  - This is the action or result that follows if the condition is met. It's the consequence of the given condition being true. We will call everything under **THEN** the **Action**.
    > > Then i'll take the umbrella with me(Action).

### **AND & OR operators**

- Sometimes you'll need more than 1 condition to be satisfied for an action to be made, you can either **AND** or **OR** to achieve this.

- The **AND** operator requires ALL conditions to be met for the action to take place.
  > > If it's raining outside(Condition 1) **AND** you have no umbrella(Condition 2) **AND** you have to go outside(Condition 3).
  > > Then buy an umbrella(Action).

- **OR** operator requires ANY condition to be met for the action to take place.
  > > If it's either a weekend(Condition 1) **OR** it's a holiday(Condition 2).
  > > Then sleep in late(Action).
