## Action types in automations

Actions are the "THEN" part of Tallyfy's "if-this-then-that" [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) rules. They define what Tallyfy automatically does when the conditions you set are met.

### What you need
- To understand the basic "if-this-then-that" logic of [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/).
- Permission to edit [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) automations.
- Basic understanding of how your workflows operate.

### Why use automation actions?
- **Less manual work**: Stop doing repetitive tasks like assigning or hiding steps.
- **Consistency**: Make sure your [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) follow the same rules every time.
- **Fewer errors**: Reduce mistakes made during routine decisions.
- **Faster processes**: Avoid delays caused by waiting for someone to manually act.
- **Enforce rules**: Make sure business rules are followed automatically.

### The four types of actions

Tallyfy offers four main types of actions you can use in your automations:

#### Assignment actions
These actions change who is responsible for [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/).
- **Add assignees**: Add people to a task without removing current assignees.
- **Replace assignees**: Remove everyone currently assigned and add new people.
- **Clear assignees**: Remove everyone currently assigned.
- Can use an "Assignee Picker" form field to decide who to assign.

**Example:** `IF (Office Location) is "Toronto" THEN assign task "Mentor Meeting" to "Jane Doe"`

#### Deadline actions
These actions automatically adjust task due dates.
- Set or change deadlines based on conditions.
- Move deadlines earlier or later.
- Base deadlines on dates from other steps or form fields.

**Example:** `IF (Package Purchased) is "Premium" THEN shift deadline -3 days for "Send First Draft"`

#### Status actions
These actions change the status of a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/).
- Mainly used to **re-open** a task that was already completed.
- Useful for approval loops where changes are needed.
- Only works on tasks that are currently marked as complete.

**Example:** `IF (Decision) is "Requires changes" THEN re-open task "Make changes for next draft"`

#### Visibility actions
These actions control whether steps are shown or hidden (this is the most common action type).
- Show or hide [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) based on answers in forms.
- Create different paths through a process based on conditions.
- Make processes adapt automatically to different situations.

**Example:** `IF (Purchase Amount) is ">$10,000" THEN SHOW "Approval by CFO" step`
