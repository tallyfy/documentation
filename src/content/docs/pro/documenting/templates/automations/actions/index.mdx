## Understanding automation actions

Actions are the "THEN" part of "if-this-then-that" [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) rules. When your conditions are met, actions tell Tallyfy exactly what to do - automatically.

### What you'll need
- You understand basic "if-this-then-that" logic
- You can edit [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) automations
- You're familiar with your workflow processes

### Why automation actions matter

Here's what actions do for you:
- **Reduce manual work**: No more repeating the same assignments or toggling step visibility.
- **Ensure consistency**: Your [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) run the same way. Every time.
- **Prevent errors**: Human mistakes from routine decisions? Gone.
- **Speed up workflows**: Actions happen instantly - no waiting for someone to click buttons.
- **Enforce business rules**: Critical policies get followed automatically (yes, even that one everyone forgets).

### The four action types

Tallyfy gives you four types of actions to automate your workflows:

#### Assignment actions
These actions decide who's responsible for [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/).

What you can do:
- **Add assignees**: Bring more people onto a task - the current assignees stay put.
- **Replace assignees**: Clear the deck and start fresh with new people.
- **Clear assignees**: Remove everyone. Period.
- Use an "Assignee Picker" form field to let someone else decide who gets assigned.

**Example:** `IF (Office Location) is "Toronto" THEN assign task "Mentor Meeting" to "Jane Doe"`

Simple.

#### Deadline actions
These actions automatically adjust when tasks are due.

You can:
- Set deadlines based on specific conditions
- Push deadlines back or pull them forward
- Base due dates on other steps or form field dates

**Example:** `IF (Package Purchased) is "Premium" THEN shift deadline -3 days for "Send First Draft"`

Premium customers get their drafts faster. Makes sense, right?

- [Combined visibility and deadline rules](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/examples/combined-visibility-deadline-rules/)

#### Status actions
These actions change a [task's](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) status.

Here's the main thing: they **re-open[^1]** completed tasks. That's it.

When is this useful? Think approval loops. Someone reviews the work, wants changes, and boom - the task reopens for edits. It only works on tasks that are already marked complete (you can't re-open something that's not closed).

**Example:** `IF (Decision) is "Requires changes" THEN re-open task "Make changes for next draft"`

Check out how this works in practice:
- [Multi-level approval loops](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/examples/multi-level-approval-loops/)

#### Visibility actions
These control whether steps appear or stay hidden - and yes, this is the action type you'll use most.

With visibility actions, you can:
- Show or hide [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) based on form answers
- Create different process paths depending on conditions
- Let processes adapt automatically to each situation

**Example:** `IF (Purchase Amount) is ">$10,000" THEN SHOW "Approval by CFO" step`

Big purchases need the CFO's eyes on them. Smaller ones? They skip right past.
