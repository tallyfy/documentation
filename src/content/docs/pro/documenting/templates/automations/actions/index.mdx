## What are automation actions?

Actions are the "THEN" part of [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) rules. When conditions are met, actions tell Tallyfy what to do - automatically.

### Why actions matter

- **Cut manual work** - stop repeating the same assignments or toggling step visibility
- **Stay consistent** - your [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) run the same way, every time
- **Prevent errors** - no human mistakes from routine decisions
- **Move faster** - actions fire instantly, no waiting for someone to click buttons
- **Enforce rules** - critical policies get followed automatically

### The five action types

Tallyfy gives you five types of actions:

#### Assignment actions

Control who's responsible for [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/).

- **Add assignees** - more people join a task without removing current assignees
- **Replace assignees** - swap out everyone and assign new people
- **Clear assignees** - remove all assignees from the task
- You can also use an "Assignee Picker" form field to let someone else choose who gets assigned

**Example:** `IF (Office Location) is "Toronto" THEN assign task "Mentor Meeting" to "Jane Doe"`

- [Service level-based task assignment](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/examples/service-level-assignment/)

#### Deadline actions

Automatically adjust when tasks are due.

- Set deadlines based on conditions
- Push deadlines back or pull them forward
- Base due dates on other steps or form field dates

**Example:** `IF (Package Purchased) is "Premium" THEN shift deadline -3 days for "Send First Draft"`

- [Combined visibility and deadline rules](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/examples/combined-visibility-deadline-rules/)

#### Status actions

These **re-open[^1]** completed [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/). That's their only function.

Think approval loops - someone reviews work, requests changes, and the task reopens for edits. This only works on tasks already marked complete. Also, a status action can't reopen the same task that triggered it.

**Example:** `IF (Decision) is "Requires changes" THEN re-open task "Make changes for next draft"`

#### Visibility actions

Control whether steps appear or stay hidden. You'll likely use this type most.

- Show or hide [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) based on form answers
- Create different process paths depending on conditions
- Won't affect tasks that are already completed

**Example:** `IF (Purchase Amount) is ">$10,000" THEN SHOW "Approval by CFO" step`

#### Webhook actions

Fire an HTTP webhook to an external URL when conditions are met. This lets you connect Tallyfy automations to outside systems and services.
