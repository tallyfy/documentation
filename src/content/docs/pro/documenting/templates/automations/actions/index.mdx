## Action types in automations

Actions are the core components of Tallyfy's [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) system that determine what happens when specified conditions are met. They represent the "THEN" part of the "IF-THEN" automation logic.

### Prerequisites
- Understanding of conditional logic in [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/)
- Access to edit [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) automations
- Knowledge of basic workflow concepts

### Benefits of automation actions
- **Reduced manual work** - Eliminate repetitive task management
- **Consistency** - Ensure [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) follow the same rules every time
- **Error prevention** - Remove human error from routine decisions
- **Process acceleration** - Eliminate delays from manual interventions
- **Standardization** - Enforce business rules automatically

### Available action types

Tallyfy provides four primary action types that can be triggered by conditions:

#### Assignment actions
Control who is responsible for [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) based on conditions.
- **Add assignees** - Adds new people without removing existing assignees
- **Replace assignees** - Removes current assignees and replaces with new ones
- **Clear assignees** - Removes all assignees without adding new ones
- Can use "Assignee Picker" field type as input for dynamic assignments
- Can add static additional assignees to supplement selections

**Example:** IF (Office Location) is "Toronto" THEN assign task "Mentor Meeting" to "Jane Doe"

#### Deadline actions
Manage [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) timing and due dates automatically.
- Set or adjust deadlines based on process conditions
- Shift deadlines forward or backward from current date
- Extract dates from other step deadlines
- Use "Date" field type values as deadline inputs
- Apply to specific steps in the workflow

**Example:** IF (Package Purchased) is "Premium" THEN shift deadline -3 days for "Send First Draft"

#### Status actions
Control [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) state transitions automatically.
- Re-open completed tasks based on conditions
- Only affects completed tasks; has no effect on incomplete tasks
- Perfect for approval processes and feedback loops
- Creates cyclic paths in processes when needed

**Example:** IF (Decision) is "Requires changes" THEN re-open task "Make changes for next draft"

#### Visibility actions
Control which steps appear in [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) (most popular action type).
- Show or hide [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) based on form selections
- Create conditional branches for different process paths
- Dynamically adapt processes to different scenarios
- Perfect for conditional approvals or specialized workflows

**Example:** IF (Purchase Amount) is ">$10,000" THEN SHOW "Approval by CFO"
