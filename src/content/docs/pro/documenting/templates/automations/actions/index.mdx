## Action types in automations

Actions are the core components of Tallyfy's automation system that determine what happens when specified conditions are met. They represent the "THEN" part of the "IF-THEN" automation logic.

### Prerequisites
- Understanding of conditional logic in automations
- Access to edit template automations
- Knowledge of basic workflow concepts

### Benefits of automation actions
- **Reduced manual work** - Eliminate repetitive task management
- **Consistency** - Ensure processes follow the same rules every time
- **Error prevention** - Remove human error from routine decisions
- **Process acceleration** - Eliminate delays from manual interventions
- **Standardization** - Enforce business rules automatically

### Available action types

Tallyfy provides four primary action types that can be triggered by conditions:

#### Assignment actions
Control who is responsible for tasks based on conditions.
- Auto-assign steps to specific users or roles
- Reassign tasks when certain criteria are met
- Distribute workload based on form field values

#### Deadline actions
Manage task timing and due dates automatically.
- Set or adjust deadlines based on process conditions
- Create escalation timelines
- Implement service level agreements (SLAs)

#### Status actions
Control task state transitions automatically.
- Auto-complete tasks when conditions are met
- Reopen completed steps for review cycles
- Skip optional steps based on criteria

#### Visibility actions
Control which steps appear in processes.
- Show or hide tasks based on form selections
- Create dynamic process paths
- Implement conditional process branches
