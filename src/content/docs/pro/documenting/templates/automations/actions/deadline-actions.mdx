## What are deadline actions?

Deadline actions automatically change the due date of a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) when certain conditions are met. You can set them up to:

- Move a deadline earlier or later by a certain amount (e.g., add 3 days).
- Set a deadline based on the deadline of *another* step in the process.
- Set a deadline based on a date entered into a "Date" type [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) earlier in the process.

Use the "Apply To" setting in the automation rule to choose which step's deadline gets changed by this action.

### Examples of deadline actions

**Example 1:** Make deadline earlier for premium service
```
IF (Package Purchased field) is "Premium"
THEN shift deadline for step "Send First Draft" 3 days earlier than its default
```
(Premium customers get their draft 3 days sooner.)

**Example 2:** Set deadline based on a meeting date
```
IF (Project Scope field) is "Complex"
THEN set deadline for step "Review Meeting" to (Client Kick-off Date field) + 5 days
```
(The review meeting deadline is set 5 working days after the date entered in the "Client Kick-off Date" field.)

**Example 3:** Link deadlines between tasks
```
IF (Initial Review task) is completed
THEN set deadline for task "Final Approval" to 2 days after the deadline of step "Client Feedback"
```
(The final approval is due 2 working days after the client feedback was due.)

![Deadline example](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-deadline-automation-example.png)

(In the screenshot example, if the condition is met, the deadline for step 13 will be pushed 1 day later than it was originally.)

:::note[Setting the starting point for the new deadline]
When you create a deadline action, you choose where the calculation starts from:

- **Current deadline**: Add or subtract time from the step's *original* deadline.
- **Another step's deadline**: Add or subtract time from the deadline of a *different* step.
- **Date field value**: Add or subtract time from a date that was entered into a *form field*.

For example, you could set the deadline for Step B to be "+2 days from Step A's deadline".

:::note[How deadlines handle weekends/non-working days]
Tallyfy automatically considers your company's working days and hours (set in Organization Settings). If a deadline action calculates a due date that falls on a weekend or outside working hours, Tallyfy will **always move the deadline forward** to the next available working time. It will *never* move a deadline backward to a previous day.

Example: If a calculation results in a Saturday deadline, Tallyfy will move it to the following Monday morning (assuming Monday is a working day).

**Important**: Tallyfy uses only calendar days and your configured work week. Country-specific holidays, organization holidays, and person-specific vacation days are not considered in deadline calculations. See [Customize work week](/products/pro/settings/org-settings/how-to-adjust-task-deadlines-to-work-week/) for more details.
