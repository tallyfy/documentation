## Deadline actions

Deadline actions adjust task due dates automatically when conditions in your automation rules are met. You can:

- Shift a deadline forward or backward by a set amount (e.g. +3 days)
- Base a deadline on another step's due date
- Set a deadline from a date entered in a [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/)

Use the **Apply To** dropdown in your automation rule to pick which step's deadline changes.

### Examples of deadline actions

**Example 1:** Make deadline earlier for premium service
```
IF (Package Purchased field) is "Premium"
THEN shift deadline for step "Send First Draft" 3 days earlier than its default
```

**Example 2:** Set deadline from a form field date
```
IF (Project Scope field) is "Complex"
THEN set deadline for step "Review Meeting" to (Client Kick-off Date field) + 5 days
```
The review meeting deadline lands 5 days[^1] after whatever date was entered in the "Client Kick-off Date" field.

**Example 3:** Link deadlines between tasks
```
IF (Initial Review task) is completed
THEN set deadline for task "Final Approval" to 2 days after the deadline of step "Client Feedback"
```
Final approval falls 2 days after the client feedback step was due.

Step 13's deadline gets pushed 1 day later when the condition is met.

:::note[Setting the starting point for the new deadline]
When creating a deadline action, pick where to start counting from:

- **Current deadline** - add or subtract from the step's existing due date
- **Another step's deadline** - build off a different step's deadline
- **Date field value** - use a date someone entered in a form field

Want Step B due 2 days after Step A? Set it as "+2 days from Step A's deadline."

:::note[How deadlines handle non-working days]
Tallyfy checks your company's working days and hours (set in **Settings** > **Organization**). If a calculated deadline falls on a non-working day or outside work hours, Tallyfy **always pushes it forward** to the next working time. Never backward.

A deadline that lands on Saturday moves to Monday morning (if Monday's a workday for you).

Tallyfy uses calendar days for its calculations, then adjusts the result to fit your configured work week. It doesn't account for public holidays or individual time off - just the work week you've defined. See [Customize work week](/products/pro/settings/org-settings/how-to-adjust-task-deadlines-to-work-week/) to change these settings.

**Coming soon**: Public holiday data for 200+ countries at [tallyfy.com/national-holidays](https://tallyfy.com/national-holidays/). A future release will skip national holidays automatically.

:::tip[Calendar-based vs relative deadlines]
Tallyfy deadlines are relative to when the process starts[^2], not calendar-based. If you need deadlines on specific days (like every Monday):

1. **Weekly patterns** - schedule process launches on those days, then use relative deadlines
2. **Monthly patterns** - use scheduled launches on specific dates
3. **Accounting cycles** - consider separate templates for different deadline patterns
4. **Variable deadlines** - use date form fields to capture dates, then set deadlines relative to them
