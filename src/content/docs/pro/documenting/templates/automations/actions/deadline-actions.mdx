## What are deadline actions

Deadline actions allow you to shift the deadline of a task based on the deadline of a task that you provide. This means that once a condition is met, you can shift the deadline of Step A, to be "n" time before or after the deadline of Step B.



> > Example: If Step A is completed, shift the deadline for Step B two weeks after the deadline for Step C.

The example above states that once a condition is met, the deadline for step 13 will be delayed for 1 day. You can choose between adding time, or resting time depending on your particular use case.

When shifting a deadline with an action. Tallyfy allow you to choose a set point on the new date, this means that the new date will take the deadline of the step you specify as the starting point. For example, if you choose to shift the deadline for step 13 by +1 days extracting the deadline for step 14. The new date for step 13 will be one day after the deadline for step 14.
