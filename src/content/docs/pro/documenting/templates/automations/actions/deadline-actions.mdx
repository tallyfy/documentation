## What are deadline actions?

Deadline actions automatically adjust task due dates in Tallyfy when specific conditions trigger them. Pretty handy, right? You'll use these to:

- Shift deadlines forward or backward by a set time (like adding 3 days)
- Link a deadline to another step's due date
- Connect deadlines to dates your team enters in [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/)

Here's the key - use the "Apply To" setting in your automation rule to pick which step's deadline changes.

### Examples of deadline actions

**Example 1:** Make deadline earlier for premium service
```
IF (Package Purchased field) is "Premium"
THEN shift deadline for step "Send First Draft" 3 days earlier than its default
```
Premium customers get their draft 3 days sooner - simple as that.

**Example 2:** Set deadline based on a meeting date
```
IF (Project Scope field) is "Complex"
THEN set deadline for step "Review Meeting" to (Client Kick-off Date field) + 5 days
```
This sets your review meeting exactly 5 working days after whatever date someone entered in the "Client Kick-off Date" field.

**Example 3:** Link deadlines between tasks
```
IF (Initial Review task) is completed
THEN set deadline for task "Final Approval" to 2 days after the deadline of step "Client Feedback"
```
Your final approval lands 2 working days after the client feedback was due. Nice and predictable.

In this screenshot, you can see how step 13's deadline gets pushed 1 day later when the condition is met.

:::note[Setting the starting point for the new deadline]
When creating a deadline action, you'll pick where to start counting from. Three options:

- **Current deadline**: Add or subtract from the step's original due date
- **Another step's deadline**: Build off a different step's deadline
- **Date field value**: Use a date someone typed into a form field

Want Step B due 2 days after Step A? Easy - just set it as "+2 days from Step A's deadline".

:::note[How deadlines handle weekends/non-working days]
Tallyfy's smart about weekends - it checks your company's working days and hours (you set these in Organization Settings). Here's what happens: if a calculated deadline falls on a weekend or outside work hours, Tallyfy **always pushes it forward** to the next working time. Never backward.

Let's say a deadline lands on Saturday. Tallyfy moves it to Monday morning (assuming that's a workday for you).

**Heads up**: Tallyfy uses calendar days and your configured work week only. It doesn't know about country holidays, company holidays, or when Bob from accounting is on vacation. Just the basic work week. Check out [Customize work week](/products/pro/settings/org-settings/how-to-adjust-task-deadlines-to-work-week/) if you need to tweak these settings.

:::tip[Calendar-based vs relative deadlines]
**Need deadlines on specific days (like every Monday)?** Tallyfy deadlines are relative to when the process starts, not calendar-based. For recurring workflows with specific day requirements:

1. **For weekly patterns** (Monday/Wednesday/Friday): Schedule process launches on those days, then use relative deadlines
2. **For monthly patterns** (1st of month, last day): Use scheduled process launches on those dates
3. **For accounting cycles**: Consider separate templates for different deadline patterns
4. **Variable deadlines**: Use date form fields to capture specific dates, then set deadlines relative to those dates

This design ensures processes work regardless of when they're launched.
