title: Automate deadline shifts on tasks
---

## What are deadline actions

Deadline actions allow you to automatically adjust task deadlines based on specific conditions. These actions provide flexible options to:

- Shift a deadline up (earlier) or down (later) for a particular step
- Extract a date from an existing deadline from another step
- Extract a date from a "Date" field type completed in a previous step

The "Apply To" section lets you select which step's deadline will be modified when the conditions are met.

### Example automations

**Example 1:** Adjust deadline based on package type
```
IF (Package Purchased) is "Premium" 
THEN shift deadline -3 days from the default for step "Send First Draft"
```
This automation moves the deadline 3 days earlier for premium customers, providing faster service.

**Example 2:** Set deadline based on date field
```
IF (Project Scope) is "Complex"
THEN set deadline to the date from (Client Meeting) date field + 5 days
```
This uses a date entered in a form field plus 5 business days as the new deadline.

**Example 3:** Chain deadlines between tasks
```
IF (Initial Review) is completed
THEN set deadline for "Final Approval" to 2 days after "Client Feedback" step deadline
```

In this example, when the condition is met, the deadline for step 13 will be delayed by 1 day from its current deadline.

:::note[Extract new date from]
When shifting a deadline with an action, Tallyfy allows you to choose a reference point for the new date:

- **Current deadline** - Shifts from the step's existing deadline
- **Another step's deadline** - Uses another step's deadline as the starting point
- **Date field value** - Uses a date entered in a form field as the starting point

For example, if you choose to shift the deadline for step 13 by +1 days from step 14's deadline, the new date for step 13 will be one day after step 14's deadline is set.

:::note[Deadline adjustments and working days]
When using deadline actions, Tallyfy respects your organization's work week settings. If a calculated deadline falls on a non-working day or outside business hours, Tallyfy will always adjust the deadline FORWARD to the next available working time. The system does not have functionality to adjust deadlines backward to previous days. For example, if an automated deadline calculation results in a weekend date, it will be moved to the following Monday, not to the preceding Friday.
