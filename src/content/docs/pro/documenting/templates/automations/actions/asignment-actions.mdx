## Assignment actions explained

Want [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to automatically route to the right people? That's what assignment actions do - they change who's responsible for a task when certain conditions happen in your workflow. Simple.

You've got three options:

- **Add assignees**: Keeps everyone who's already assigned and adds new people to the mix
- **Replace assignees**: Clears out current assignees and starts fresh with only the people you specify
- **Clear assignees**: Removes everyone (yes, the task becomes unassigned until someone picks it up)

Here's where it gets interesting. You can assign to specific people or groups, or you can use an "Assignee Picker[^2]" [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to let someone choose the assignee when they're filling out the form. Want both? No problem - assign the person from the field plus add their manager automatically.

:::warning[Watch out for unintended assignees]
Remember that tasks without assignees default to the process launcher[^1] (unless "Assign launcher automatically" is OFF). If your automation uses **"Add assignees"**, the launcher stays assigned along with your new assignees. Use **"Replace assignees"** to assign only the people you want.

### Examples of assignment actions

**Example 1:** Assign based on location
```
IF (Office Location field) is "Toronto"
THEN Add assignee "Jane Doe" to task "Mentor Meeting"
```
What happens? When someone selects Toronto as their office, Jane automatically gets added to mentor them. The original assignee stays on too.

**Example 2:** Replace assignees based on department
```
IF (Department field) is "Legal"
THEN Replace all assignees for task "Contract Review" with "Legal Team" group
```
This one's different - it completely replaces whoever was assigned before. Now only the Legal Team handles contract reviews for legal department requests.

**Example 3:** Using an Assignee Picker field
```
IF (Project Type field) is "Urgent"
THEN Replace all assignees for task "Approval" with (Project Manager field)
```
Here you're letting someone pick the project manager in a form field. For urgent projects, that chosen person becomes the sole approver.

**Example 4:** Fixing unintended launcher assignment
```
Problem: Task has no assignees → Process launcher gets it → Automation adds Kassie → Both are now assigned
Solution: Use "Replace assignees" instead of "Add assignees" to assign only Kassie
```
This happens because unassigned tasks default to the launcher. "Add" keeps the launcher, "Replace" removes them.

**Important**: Don't forget the "Apply To" setting - it tells Tallyfy exactly which task step should get these new assignments. Otherwise your automation won't know where to apply the changes.
