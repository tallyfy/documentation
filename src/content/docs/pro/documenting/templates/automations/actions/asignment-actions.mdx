## What are assignment actions

Asignment actions allow you to dynamically assign people to a task when a condition is met.

- Choosing the **Assign** action will **ONLY** add any assignee you decide to the ongoing task.
- Choosing the **Assign only** action will remove any current assignee and replace it with the ones you specify.

> > Example: If Step A is completed, Assign Person A,B and C to step D.

The example above establishes that once a condition is met, Richard Matthews will be the **only** person assigned to Step #2. Pretty simple right?
