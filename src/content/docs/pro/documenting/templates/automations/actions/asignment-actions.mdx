## What are Assignment Actions?

Assignment actions automatically change who is responsible for a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) when certain conditions in your process are met. You have three choices for how to change the assignment:

- **Add assignees**: Adds the person(s) you choose to the task. Anyone already assigned stays assigned.
- **Replace assignees**: Removes *everyone* currently assigned and assigns only the person(s) you choose.
- **Clear assignees**: Removes *everyone* currently assigned, leaving the task unassigned.

You can choose specific people/groups for the action, or you can tell Tallyfy to use the person selected in an "Assignee Picker" type [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/). You can also combine these (e.g., assign to the person picked in a field *plus* always assign to a specific manager).

### Examples of Assignment Actions

**Example 1:** Assign based on location
```
IF (Office Location field) is "Toronto"
THEN Add assignee "Jane Doe" to task "Mentor Meeting"
```
(If the office is Toronto, Jane Doe is added as an assignee for the meeting.)

**Example 2:** Replace assignees based on department
```
IF (Department field) is "Legal"
THEN Replace all assignees for task "Contract Review" with "Legal Team" group
```
(If the department is Legal, only the Legal Team group will be assigned to review the contract, removing anyone else previously assigned.)

**Example 3:** Using an Assignee Picker field
```
IF (Project Type field) is "Urgent"
THEN Replace all assignees for task "Approval" with (Project Manager field)
```
(If the project is urgent, the task is assigned only to whoever was selected in the "Project Manager" form field.)

Remember to use the "Apply To" setting within the automation rule to select exactly which task step this assignment action should affect.
