## Assignment actions explained

Assignment actions automatically change who handles a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) based on conditions in your process. You have three ways to modify assignments:

- **Add assignees**: Adds new people to the task while keeping existing assignees.
- **Replace assignees**: Removes everyone currently assigned and adds only the people you specify.
- **Clear assignees**: Removes all current assignees, leaving the task unassigned.

Choose specific people or groups for assignments, or use whoever gets selected in an "Assignee Picker" [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/). You can even combine both approaches - assign to the person picked in a field plus a specific manager.

### Examples of assignment actions

**Example 1:** Assign based on location
```
IF (Office Location field) is "Toronto"
THEN Add assignee "Jane Doe" to task "Mentor Meeting"
```
Result: Jane Doe gets added to the Mentor Meeting when the office location is Toronto.

**Example 2:** Replace assignees based on department
```
IF (Department field) is "Legal"
THEN Replace all assignees for task "Contract Review" with "Legal Team" group
```
Result: Only the Legal Team handles contract review when department is Legal, replacing any previous assignees.

**Example 3:** Using an Assignee Picker field
```
IF (Project Type field) is "Urgent"
THEN Replace all assignees for task "Approval" with (Project Manager field)
```
Result: The person chosen in the Project Manager field gets exclusive assignment for urgent projects.
