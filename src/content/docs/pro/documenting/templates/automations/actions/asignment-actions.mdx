  or replacing existing ones based on specific conditions within a workflow.

## What are assignment actions

Assignment actions allow you to dynamically control who is responsible for a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) when specific conditions are met. They offer three options for managing task assignments:

- **Add assignees** - Adds specified users to the current list of assignees without removing existing ones
- **Replace assignees** - Removes all existing assignees and assigns only the specified users
- **Clear assignees** - Removes all current assignees without adding anyone new

The action can use either explicit assignee selections or take the outcome of an "Assignee Picker" [field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) type as input. You can also add additional static assignees to supplement your selection.

### Example automations

**Example 1:** Assign based on location
```
IF (Office Location) is "Toronto" 
THEN assign [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) "Mentor Meeting" to "Jane Doe"
```
This [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) assigns Jane Doe to the task because she's the mentor stationed in Toronto.

**Example 2:** Replace existing assignees based on department
```
IF (Department) is "Legal" 
THEN replace all assignees for "Contract Review" with "Legal Team"
```

**Example 3:** Using Assignee Picker field
```
IF (Project Type) is "Urgent"
THEN assign [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) "Approval" to the outcome of (Project Manager) field
```
This uses whoever was selected in the "Project Manager" Assignee Picker field as the task assignee.

The "Apply To" section lets you choose which step the assignment action will affect, providing precise control over your workflow assignments.
