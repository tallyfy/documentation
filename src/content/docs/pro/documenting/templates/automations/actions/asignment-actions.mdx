## Assignment actions explained

Assignment actions change who's responsible for a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) when conditions are met in your workflow. You've got three options:

- **Add assignees** - keeps everyone already assigned and adds new people
- **Replace assignees** - clears current assignees and sets only the people you specify
- **Clear assignees** - removes everyone, leaving the task unassigned

You can assign specific members, guests, or groups. You can also use an Assignee Picker[^2] [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) so someone picks the assignee while filling out the form. If the picker field is empty, Tallyfy falls back to any manually specified assignees in the same action.

:::warning[Watch out for unintended assignees]
Tasks without assignees default to the process launcher[^1] unless the step's auto-assign launcher setting is turned off. If your automation uses **Add assignees**, the launcher stays assigned alongside your new people. Use **Replace assignees** to assign only who you want.
:::

### Examples

**Example 1:** Assign based on location
```
IF (Office Location field) is "Toronto"
THEN Add assignee "Jane Doe" to task "Mentor Meeting"
```
Jane gets added when someone selects Toronto. The original assignee stays on too.

**Example 2:** Replace assignees by department
```
IF (Department field) is "Legal"
THEN Replace all assignees for task "Contract Review" with "Legal Team" group
```
This completely replaces whoever was assigned. Only the Legal Team handles contract reviews for legal requests.

**Example 3:** Using an Assignee Picker field
```
IF (Project Type field) is "Urgent"
THEN Replace all assignees for task "Approval" with (Project Manager field)
```
Someone picks the project manager in a form field. For urgent projects, that person becomes the sole approver.

**Example 4:** Fixing unintended launcher assignment
```
Problem: Task has no assignees → launcher gets it → automation adds Kassie → both assigned
Solution: Use "Replace assignees" instead of "Add assignees" to assign only Kassie
```
Unassigned tasks default to the launcher. "Add" keeps the launcher; "Replace" removes them.

Every assignment action needs the **Apply to** setting - it tells Tallyfy which step should get the new assignments. Assignment actions won't apply to already-completed tasks.
