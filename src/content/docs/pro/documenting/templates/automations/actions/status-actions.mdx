## Status actions explained

Status actions in Tallyfy do one thing - they automatically **re-open a step ([task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/)) that was already marked as complete.** The target task must already be complete for this to work. If it's still open or hasn't started yet, nothing happens.

They're particularly handy for:
- **Approval/rejection steps** - when something gets rejected, the previous step automatically re-opens so corrections can be made.
- **Feedback loops** - need to send a process back for revisions? Status actions handle the return trip.

### Examples of status actions

**Example 1:** Re-open task after rejection
```
IF (Approval Decision field) is "Requires changes"
THEN re-open task "Make changes for next draft"
```
When reviewers request changes, that draft task opens right back up.

**Example 2:** Loop back if quality check fails
```
IF (Quality Check field) is "Failed"
THEN re-open task "Review product specifications"
```
This sends the process back to specification review whenever quality doesn't pass.

**Example 3:** Handle document corrections
```
IF (Manager Approval field) is "Rejected"
THEN re-open task "Update documentation"
```
Manager says no? The documentation task re-opens automatically.

Completing step 2 automatically re-opens step 3 - that's your process loop in action.

:::note[Important limitations]
- Status actions can **only re-open completed tasks**. That's their one job.
- They can't complete, cancel, or modify tasks that are still open or not yet started.
- A status action can't re-open the same task that triggered it - the target must be a different step.
