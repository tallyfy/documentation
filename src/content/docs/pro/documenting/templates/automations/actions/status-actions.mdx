snippet: Status actions enable reopening of completed steps in a workflow to facilitate
  approval processes and looping scenarios by automatically triggering when specific
  conditions are met.
title: Automate changing the status of tasks

## What are Status Actions?

Status actions have one specific job: they automatically **re-open a step ([task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/)) that was already marked as complete.**

This action only works if the task you target is currently complete. If the task is still open or hasn't started, this action does nothing.

Status actions are mainly used for:
- **Approval/Rejection steps**: If something is rejected, automatically re-open the previous step so corrections can be made.
- **Feedback loops**: Send a process back to an earlier step for revisions based on a review.

### Examples of Status Actions

**Example 1:** Re-open task after rejection
```
IF (Approval Decision field) is "Requires changes"
THEN re-open task "Make changes for next draft"
```
(If the reviewer requests changes, the task for making changes is automatically re-opened.)

**Example 2:** Loop back if quality check fails
```
IF (Quality Check field) is "Failed"
THEN re-open task "Review product specifications"
```
(If the quality check fails, the process goes back to the specification review step.)

**Example 3:** Handle document corrections
```
IF (Manager Approval field) is "Rejected"
THEN re-open task "Update documentation"
```
(If the manager rejects the document, the task to update it is re-opened.)

![Status example](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-statusactionexample.png)

(In the screenshot example, if step 2 is completed, the rule automatically re-opens step 3, potentially creating a loop back in the process.)

:::note[Important limitations]
- Status actions can **only re-open completed tasks**.
- They cannot automatically complete, cancel, or change the status of tasks that are still active or not yet started.
- This action has **no effect** if the target task is not already complete.
