snippet: Status actions enable reopening of completed steps in a workflow to facilitate
  approval processes and looping scenarios by automatically triggering when specific
  conditions are met.
title: Automate changing the status of tasks
---

## What are status actions?

Status actions will re-open a step that was already completed. This action only applies if the target [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) is currently complete; otherwise, it has no effect. Status actions are especially useful for approval/rejection workflows and creating feedback loops within [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).

### Example automations

**Example 1:** Reopen task after rejection
```
IF (Decision) is "Requires changes" 
THEN re-open [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) "Make changes for next draft"
```
This [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) restarts the editing process when reviewers request changes.

**Example 2:** Create a feedback loop
```
IF (Quality Check) is "Failed"
THEN re-open [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) "Review product specifications"
```

**Example 3:** Handle document corrections
```
IF (Manager Approval) is "Rejected"
THEN re-open [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) "Update documentation"
```

![Status example](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-statusactionexample.png)

In this example, if step 2 is completed, then step 3 will be re-opened, creating a loop in the [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) flow.

:::note[Status action limitations]
Status actions can only re-open completed [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/). They cannot directly complete, cancel, or otherwise change the status of active or inactive tasks. Status actions have no effect on tasks that are not yet completed.
