title: Automate changing the status of tasks

## What are status actions?

Status actions will re-open a step that was already completed. This is especially useful when dealing with approve/reject processes where if a specific step is rejected, we can simply re-open some previous tasks in the process and keep working until it's successfully approved.

![Status example](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-statusactionexample.png)

In this example, if step 2 is completed, then step 3 will be re-open. This works great for looping scenarios.
