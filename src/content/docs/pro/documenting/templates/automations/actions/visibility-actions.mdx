## Visibility actions explained

Visibility actions let you **Show** or **Hide** specific steps based on conditions. They're smart switches - users see exactly what they need, when they need it.

### Examples

**Example 1 - CFO approval for big purchases:**
```
IF (Purchase Amount field) is ">$10,000"
THEN SHOW step "Approval by CFO"
```
The CFO approval step appears automatically for purchases over $10k.

**Example 2 - Skip irrelevant reviews:**
```
IF (Customer Type field) is "Small Business"
THEN HIDE step "Enterprise Security Review"
```
Small business customers skip the enterprise security review entirely.

**Example 3 - Adapt to user input:**
```
IF (Application Type field) is "Mortgage"
THEN SHOW steps "Credit Check", "Property Valuation", and "Underwriting"
```
Selecting "Mortgage" reveals all mortgage-specific steps at once.

Here's what it looks like in action:

Completing one step makes the next one appear. That's visibility automation at work.

:::note[How visibility works]
- Steps are **visible by default** unless you hide them.
- You can hide a step when building the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) - toggle **Hide by default** in the step settings.
- A **Hide** action makes steps disappear based on conditions.
- A **Show** action reveals hidden steps when conditions are met.
:::

:::warning[Hidden steps can't be completed]
Hidden steps have an internal status of `auto-skipped` and can't be completed. Any automation checking "if step is complete" on a hidden step won't trigger - unless another rule makes that step visible first.

Only create completion-based automations for steps users can actually see. You can also [manually show or hide steps](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/manually-show-hide-tasks/) using the three-dot menu on any task.
:::

:::note[Default behavior: parallel execution]
Procedure templates in Tallyfy show all steps at once by default. People can work on them in any order[^1]. To enforce sequential order, hide steps initially and use **Show** automation rules to reveal them when previous steps complete.
:::

### Hiding tasks by default in a template

All tasks show up when someone launches a [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). To keep certain tasks hidden until the right moment:

<Steps>
1.  Open your procedure template in the editor.
2.  Click on the step you want to hide initially.
3.  In the step's settings panel, toggle **Hide by default** to Yes.
4.  Save the step.
</Steps>

Hidden steps stay out of sight until a **Show** automation brings them back.

### Enforcing sequential task order

Sometimes Task B shouldn't start until Task A is done. You can force tasks to appear in sequence using hidden tasks and **Show** visibility actions in your [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/)[^2].

<Steps>
1.  **Task A**: Leave it visible by default.
2.  **Task B**: Set it to [hidden by default](#hiding-tasks-by-default-in-a-template).
3.  **Task C**: Set it to [hidden by default](#hiding-tasks-by-default-in-a-template).
4.  **Create Automation Rule 1 (Show Task B)**:
    *   **IF** `(Step Status)` for `Task A` **is** `Completed`
    *   **THEN** `(Visibility)` **SHOW** `Task B`
5.  **Create Automation Rule 2 (Show Task C)**:
    *   **IF** `(Step Status)` for `Task B` **is** `Completed`
    *   **THEN** `(Visibility)` **SHOW** `Task C`
</Steps>

The result:
- Process starts - only Task A shows up
- Complete Task A - Task B appears
- Complete Task B - Task C appears

You can chain as many tasks as you need this way.

[^1]: All visible tasks can be completed simultaneously by different assignees without waiting
[^2]: Sequential dependency ensures tasks complete in order, preventing race conditions
