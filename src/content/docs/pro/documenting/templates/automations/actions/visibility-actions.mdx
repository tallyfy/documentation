## What are Visibility Actions?

Visibility actions automatically **Show** or **Hide** specific steps in your process based on conditions being met. This is a very common way to make [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) change based on answers or situations.

### Examples of Visibility Actions

**Example 1:** Show an extra approval step for large amounts
```
IF (Purchase Amount field) is ">$10,000"
THEN SHOW step "Approval by CFO"
```
(If the purchase is over $10k, the CFO approval step appears; otherwise, it stays hidden.)

**Example 2:** Hide steps not relevant to certain customers
```
IF (Customer Type field) is "Small Business"
THEN HIDE step "Enterprise Security Review"
```
(Small business customers don't need the enterprise review step, so it's hidden for them.)

**Example 3:** Show different steps based on application type
```
IF (Application Type field) is "Mortgage"
THEN SHOW steps "Credit Check", "Property Valuation", and "Underwriting"
```
(Only show the mortgage-specific steps if the application type is Mortgage.)

Let's look at another example:

(In this screenshot example, the rule says IF a specific step is completed, THEN step 2 will be shown.)

:::note[How visibility works]
- Steps are **visible by default** unless you hide them.
- You can hide a step initially when building the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) (using its settings).
- You can use a **Hide** visibility action in an automation rule to hide a step based on a condition.
- You can use a **Show** visibility action in an automation rule to make a hidden step appear when a condition is met.

This lets you build processes that only show the relevant steps at the right time.
