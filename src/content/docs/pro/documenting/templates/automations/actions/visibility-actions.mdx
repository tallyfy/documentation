## What are visibility actions

Visibility actions allow you to either **Show** or **Hide** a step based on a condition. One common use case for this, is to make sure that steps from a certain process are completed in linear order.

Let's learn by example by taking a look at the following Automation:

![Visibility example](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-task-completion-example-automations.png)

In this particular example, the condition (IF) stablishes that if a step is completed, Then step 2 will be shown in the process. Pretty simple right?.

When you define a **Visibility** action, the step you define as the one to be shown will remain hidden until the particular condition is met.
