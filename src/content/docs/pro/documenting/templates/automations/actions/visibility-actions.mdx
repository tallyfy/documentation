## Visibility actions explained

Visibility actions in Tallyfy let you **Show** or **Hide** specific steps based on conditions. Think of them as smart switches - they make sure users see exactly what they need, when they need it. Nothing gets missed.

### Examples of visibility actions

**Example 1:** Need CFO approval for big purchases?
```
IF (Purchase Amount field) is ">$10,000"
THEN SHOW step "Approval by CFO"
```
Result: The CFO approval step pops up automatically for purchases over $10k. No more chasing signatures or wondering if you missed something.

**Example 2:** Small business customers don't need enterprise-level reviews
```
IF (Customer Type field) is "Small Business"
THEN HIDE step "Enterprise Security Review"
```
Result: Your small business customers skip the enterprise security review - it's hidden because they simply don't need it. The process stays clean and relevant.

**Example 3:** Let the process adapt to what users tell you
```
IF (Application Type field) is "Mortgage"
THEN SHOW steps "Credit Check", "Property Valuation", and "Underwriting"
```
Result: When someone selects "Mortgage", boom - all the mortgage-specific steps appear. Credit checks, property valuation, underwriting. Everything they need.

Here's what it looks like in action:

See how completing one step makes the next one appear? That's visibility automation at work.

:::note[How visibility works]
- Steps are **visible by default** unless you hide them.
- You can hide a step initially when building the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) (just toggle it in the settings).
- Use a **Hide** visibility action to make steps disappear based on conditions.
- Use a **Show** visibility action to reveal hidden steps when the time is right.

The beauty of this approach? Every step gets considered - it's either shown when needed or deliberately hidden when it's not. Simple.
:::

:::warning[Hidden steps and completion]
Here's the catch: hidden steps can't be completed. They'll sit there, incomplete, forever. If you've got an automation checking "if step is complete" on a hidden step - it won't trigger. Ever. (Unless another rule makes that step visible first.)

The fix? Only create completion-based automations for steps users can actually see. Need a quick workaround? You can manually show or hide steps using the "three dots" menu on any task.
:::

:::note[Steps and parallel execution]
Tallyfy shows all steps at once by default. People can work on them in any order - true parallel processing.

Want a step hidden from the start? Hide it by default, then create an automation to **show** it when conditions are right. This way, the step only appears when it's actually needed.

### Hiding tasks by default in a template

When you're building a [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), all tasks show up automatically when someone launches the process. But what if you want certain tasks to stay hidden until the right moment? You'll need to hide them first.

<Steps>
1.  Open your procedure template in the editor.
2.  Click on the specific step (task) you want to hide initially.
3.  In the step's configuration panel (usually on the right), look for an option like **Hidden by default** or **Hide this step when the process starts** and enable it.
4.  Save the changes to your step.
</Steps>

That's it. Hidden steps stay out of sight until a **Show** automation brings them back.

### Enforcing sequential task order

Remember how Tallyfy shows all tasks at once? Sometimes that's not what you want. Maybe Task B shouldn't start until Task A is done. Or Task C needs to wait for Task B.

Here's the thing - you can force tasks to appear in sequence. It's like creating a relay race where each runner waits for the baton. You'll use a mix of hidden tasks and **Show** visibility actions in your [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/).

Here's how to set up a simple sequence:

<Steps>
1.  **Task A**: This is your first task in the sequence. Leave it visible by default.
2.  **Task B**: In the template editor, set Task B to be [hidden by default](#hiding-tasks-by-default-in-a-template).
3.  **Task C**: In the template editor, set Task C to be [hidden by default](#hiding-tasks-by-default-in-a-template).
4.  **Create Automation Rule 1 (Show Task B)**:
    *   **IF** `(Step Status)` for `Task A` **is** `Completed`
    *   **THEN** `(Visibility)` **SHOW** `Task B`
5.  **Create Automation Rule 2 (Show Task C)**:
    *   **IF** `(Step Status)` for `Task B` **is** `Completed`
    *   **THEN** `(Visibility)` **SHOW** `Task C`
</Steps>

Here's what happens:
- Process starts → only Task A shows up
- Complete Task A → Task B appears  
- Complete Task B → Task C appears

Perfect sequence. No jumping ahead, no confusion. You can chain as many tasks as you need this way - 5, 10, even 20 steps in perfect order.
