## What are visibility actions

Visibility actions allow you to either **Show** or **Hide** a step based on specific conditions. This is the most popular automation action type in Tallyfy, used to create dynamic processes that adapt to different scenarios and requirements.

### Example automations

**Example 1:** Show approval step for high-value purchases
```
IF (Purchase Amount) is ">$10,000" 
THEN SHOW "Approval by CFO"
```
This automation ensures large purchases receive appropriate financial approval.

**Example 2:** Hide optional steps based on customer type
```
IF (Customer Type) is "Small Business"
THEN HIDE "Enterprise Security Review"
```

**Example 3:** Create conditional process branches
```
IF (Application Type) is "Mortgage"
THEN SHOW "Credit Check", "Property Valuation", and "Underwriting"
```

Let's examine a specific example:

In this particular example, the condition (IF) establishes that if a step is completed, then step 2 will be shown in the process.

:::note[Note on visibility actions]
When you define a **Visibility** action, the step you define as the one to be shown will remain hidden until the particular condition is met. This behavior creates dynamic, adaptive processes that reveal steps only when appropriate.

By default, all steps are visible unless you specifically hide them through:
1. Initial template settings
2. Visibility actions that hide steps based on conditions
