## What are Visibility Actions?

Visibility actions automatically **Show** or **Hide** specific steps in your process based on conditions being met. This is a very common way to make [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) change based on answers or situations.

### Examples of Visibility Actions

**Example 1:** Show an extra approval step for large amounts
```
IF (Purchase Amount field) is ">$10,000"
THEN SHOW step "Approval by CFO"
```
(If the purchase is over $10k, the CFO approval step appears; otherwise, it stays hidden.)

**Example 2:** Hide steps not relevant to certain customers
```
IF (Customer Type field) is "Small Business"
THEN HIDE step "Enterprise Security Review"
```
(Small business customers don't need the enterprise review step, so it's hidden for them.)

**Example 3:** Show different steps based on application type
```
IF (Application Type field) is "Mortgage"
THEN SHOW steps "Credit Check", "Property Valuation", and "Underwriting"
```
(Only show the mortgage-specific steps if the application type is Mortgage.)

Let's look at another example:

![Visibility example](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-task-completion-example-automations.png)

(In this screenshot example, the rule says IF a specific step is completed, THEN step 2 will be shown.)

:::note[How visibility works]
- Steps are **visible by default** unless you hide them.
- You can hide a step initially when building the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) (using its settings).
- You can use a **Hide** visibility action in an automation rule to hide a step based on a condition.
- You can use a **Show** visibility action in an automation rule to make a hidden step appear when a condition is met.

This lets you build processes that only show the relevant steps at the right time.

### Hiding tasks by default in a template

When designing a [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), any task you add is visible by default once the process launches. If you intend to control its visibility through automations (e.g., only show it after a prior task is completed), you must first set it to be hidden by default.

<Steps>
1.  Open your procedure template in the editor.
2.  Click on the specific step (task) you want to hide initially.
3.  In the step's configuration panel (usually on the right), look for an option like **Hidden by default** or **Hide this step when the process starts** and enable it.
4.  Save the changes to your step.
</Steps>

Once a step is hidden by default, it will not appear when a process is launched from this template unless an automation rule with a **Show** action makes it visible.

### Enforcing sequential task order

By default, when you launch a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) from a [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), all non-hidden tasks can be started and completed in any order, effectively allowing for parallel work.

To enforce a specific sequence for tasks (e.g., Task B can only be started after Task A is completed, and Task C only after Task B), you need to use a combination of hiding tasks by default and **Show** visibility actions in your [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/).

Here's how to set up a simple sequence:

<Steps>
1.  **Task A**: This is your first task in the sequence. Leave it visible by default.
2.  **Task B**: In the template editor, set Task B to be [hidden by default](#hiding-tasks-by-default-in-a-template).
3.  **Task C**: In the template editor, set Task C to be [hidden by default](#hiding-tasks-by-default-in-a-template).
4.  **Create Automation Rule 1 (Show Task B)**:
    *   **IF** `(Step Status)` for `Task A` **is** `Completed`
    *   **THEN** `(Visibility)` **SHOW** `Task B`
5.  **Create Automation Rule 2 (Show Task C)**:
    *   **IF** `(Step Status)` for `Task B` **is** `Completed`
    *   **THEN** `(Visibility)` **SHOW** `Task C`
</Steps>

With this setup:
- When the process starts, only Task A is visible.
- Once Task A is completed, Task B becomes visible.
- Once Task B is completed, Task C becomes visible.

This method allows you to build clear, step-by-step procedures where tasks unlock progressively. You can extend this pattern for as many sequential tasks as needed.
