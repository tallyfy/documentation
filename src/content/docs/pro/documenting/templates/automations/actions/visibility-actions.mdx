## Visibility actions explained

Visibility actions automatically **Show** or **Hide** specific steps based on conditions in your process. This is the most common way to make [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) adapt to different answers or situations.

### Examples of visibility actions

**Example 1:** Show an extra approval step for large amounts
```
IF (Purchase Amount field) is ">$10,000"
THEN SHOW step "Approval by CFO"
```
Result: CFO approval step appears for purchases over $10k, stays hidden for smaller amounts.

**Example 2:** Hide steps not relevant to certain customers
```
IF (Customer Type field) is "Small Business"
THEN HIDE step "Enterprise Security Review"
```
Result: Enterprise review step gets hidden for small business customers who don't need it.

**Example 3:** Show different steps based on application type
```
IF (Application Type field) is "Mortgage"
THEN SHOW steps "Credit Check", "Property Valuation", and "Underwriting"
```
Result: Mortgage-specific steps only appear when application type is Mortgage.

Let's look at another example:

This example shows a rule where completing one step triggers step 2 to become visible.

:::note[How visibility works]
- Steps are **visible by default** unless you hide them.
- You can hide a step initially when building the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) (using its settings).
- You can use a **Hide** visibility action in an automation rule to hide a step based on a condition.
- You can use a **Show** visibility action in an automation rule to make a hidden step appear when a condition is met.

This lets you build processes that only show the relevant steps at the right time.
:::

:::note[Steps and parallel execution]
All steps always show and are available to do in parallel by default, unless they are hidden by default using an automation.

If you want a step to be hidden by default, you need to create an automation that **shows** that step - this approach implies that the step will be hidden by default until the automation condition is met.

### Hiding tasks by default in a template

When designing a [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), tasks are visible by default when processes launch. To control visibility through automations, you need to hide the task by default first.

<Steps>
1.  Open your procedure template in the editor.
2.  Click on the specific step (task) you want to hide initially.
3.  In the step's configuration panel (usually on the right), look for an option like **Hidden by default** or **Hide this step when the process starts** and enable it.
4.  Save the changes to your step.
</Steps>

Hidden steps stay invisible until a **Show** automation rule makes them appear.

### Enforcing sequential task order

By default, launching a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) makes all visible tasks available immediately. People can work on them in any order - essentially parallel execution.

To enforce a specific sequence for tasks (e.g., Task B can only be started after Task A is completed, and Task C only after Task B), you need to use a combination of hiding tasks by default and **Show** visibility actions in your [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/).

Here's how to set up a simple sequence:

<Steps>
1.  **Task A**: This is your first task in the sequence. Leave it visible by default.
2.  **Task B**: In the template editor, set Task B to be [hidden by default](#hiding-tasks-by-default-in-a-template).
3.  **Task C**: In the template editor, set Task C to be [hidden by default](#hiding-tasks-by-default-in-a-template).
4.  **Create Automation Rule 1 (Show Task B)**:
    *   **IF** `(Step Status)` for `Task A` **is** `Completed`
    *   **THEN** `(Visibility)` **SHOW** `Task B`
5.  **Create Automation Rule 2 (Show Task C)**:
    *   **IF** `(Step Status)` for `Task B` **is** `Completed`
    *   **THEN** `(Visibility)` **SHOW** `Task C`
</Steps>

With this setup:
- When the process starts, only Task A is visible.
- Once Task A is completed, Task B becomes visible.
- Once Task B is completed, Task C becomes visible.

This method allows you to build clear, step-by-step procedures where tasks unlock progressively. You can extend this pattern for as many sequential tasks as needed.
