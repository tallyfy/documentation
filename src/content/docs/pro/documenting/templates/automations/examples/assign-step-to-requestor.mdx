title: Automatically assign a step to the original process requestor
---

import { Steps } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

Capture who kicked off a process and automatically route a later step back to them - perfect for sending payment confirmations, completed documents, or results to the original requestor.

## Use case

You're running a purchase request process:

1.  Sarah from marketing submits a request for new software.
2.  The request goes through approvals and finance.
3.  Your accountant uploads the payment proof.
4.  Sarah should automatically get that proof - without anyone remembering who started the request.

How do you capture Sarah's identity at the start and notify her at the end?

## Prerequisites

*   An existing [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).
*   Familiarity with [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) - especially the **Assignee Picker** field type.
*   A basic grasp of [template automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/).

## Setting up this automation

<Steps>
1.  **Capture the requestor on the kick-off form[^1] or in any other step**

    Edit your template's kick-off form. Add an **Assignee Picker** form field and label it something like "Who is making this request?". Whoever launches the process selects themselves (or someone else if submitting on behalf of a colleague). Make it required so nobody skips it.

2.  **Set up the step to be assigned**

    Find the step where you want to notify the requestor - usually near the end. If you're sending an email notification, set the step type to **Email Auto-Send[^2]**. Configure the email content and use [variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/) like `{{step_4_upload_field}}` to pull in data collected earlier. Set the timing too (maybe 1 hour after "Upload Proof of Payment" completes).

3.  **Create the automation rule**

    Go to the **Automations** tab in your template editor. Click **Add Automation** and give it a clear name. For the **IF** condition, pick the assignee picker field from step 1 and set it to **is not empty**. For the **THEN** action, choose **Assignment Action** > **Replace Assignees**. Select your notification step and for the replacement source, pick that same assignee picker field. Save. That's it.
</Steps>

## How it works at runtime

When someone launches your process:

1.  Sarah fills out the kick-off form and selects herself in the assignee picker field.
2.  The process moves through all its steps - approvals, processing, everything.
3.  Tallyfy evaluates your automation rule and checks whether the assignee picker field was filled in.
4.  Since it's not empty, the automation fires.
5.  The **Replace Assignees** action swaps whoever was originally assigned to the final email step with Sarah from the picker field.
6.  Because you set the step type to **Email Auto-Send**, Tallyfy sends the email automatically on the due date. No manual work needed.

Sarah gets her payment proof without anyone having to remember she started this process three days ago.
