title: Service level-based task assignment
---

Use Tallyfy [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) to route [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to different team members based on customer service levels. IF-THEN rules on kick-off form fields let you match the right expertise to each customer's tier automatically.

## When you'd use service-based routing

- **Tiered support** - Enterprise customers get a dedicated team; free users get standard support
- **Sales processes** - High-value deals go to senior closers
- **Professional services** - Complex projects get senior consultants; simple ones go to junior staff
- **Subscription management** - Enterprise onboarding gets your best people; free trials go to anyone

## Setting up service-based assignment

### Basic service level routing

Here's a real example - routing tasks based on service packages.

**Scenario**: You're onboarding clients, and Platinum customers need your best account manager.

1. **Add a service selection field to your kick-off form[^1]**:
   - Field type: Dropdown or Radio
   - Options: "Basic", "Professional", "Platinum"
   - Label: "Select service package"

2. **Create assignment rules for each level**:

   **Rule 1: Platinum service**
   ```
   IF (Service Package field) is "Platinum"
   THEN Replace Assignees for "Prepare proposal" with "Sarah Chen"
   AND Replace Assignees for "Account setup" with "Sarah Chen"
   ```

   **Rule 2: Professional service**
   ```
   IF (Service Package field) is "Professional"
   THEN Replace Assignees for "Prepare proposal" with "Mike Johnson"
   AND Replace Assignees for "Account setup" with "Mike Johnson"
   ```

   **Rule 3: Basic service**
   ```
   IF (Service Package field) is "Basic"
   THEN Replace Assignees for "Prepare proposal" with "Support Team" group
   AND Replace Assignees for "Account setup" with "Support Team" group
   ```

### Advanced patterns

#### Workload-balanced assignment

Don't pile everything on one person - assign to a group instead:

```
IF (Service Package field) is "Platinum"
THEN Replace Assignees for all account management tasks with "Senior Account Managers" group
```

When you assign to a group, Tallyfy distributes work across its members.

#### Multi-criteria assignment

Combine multiple conditions when service level alone isn't enough:

```
IF (Service Package field) is "Enterprise"
AND (Industry field) is "Healthcare"
THEN Replace Assignees for "Compliance review" with "Healthcare Specialist Team"
```

This matches expertise to both customer tier AND industry.

#### Progressive expertise escalation

Higher tiers often need extra approval steps:

```
IF (Service Package field) is "Basic"
THEN Hide "Executive review" step

IF (Service Package field) is "Enterprise"
THEN Show "Executive review" step
AND Assign "Executive review" to "C-Suite" group
```

## Example: Technical support tiers

Here's how a support team can route tickets by customer tier.

**Kick-off form fields**:
- Customer tier (dropdown): "Free", "Starter", "Growth", "Enterprise"
- Issue type (dropdown): "Bug", "Feature Request", "Integration Help"

**Automation rules**:

1. **Free tier - community support**:
   ```
   IF (Customer Tier) is "Free"
   THEN Assign "Initial response" to "Community Managers"
   AND Update deadline to 48 hours from now
   ```

2. **Starter tier - standard support**:
   ```
   IF (Customer Tier) is "Starter"
   THEN Assign "Initial response" to "Tier 1 Support"
   AND Update deadline to 24 hours from now
   ```

3. **Growth tier - priority support**:
   ```
   IF (Customer Tier) is "Growth"
   THEN Assign "Initial response" to "Tier 2 Support"
   AND Update deadline to 4 hours from now
   ```

4. **Enterprise - dedicated support**:
   ```
   IF (Customer Tier) is "Enterprise"
   THEN Assign "Initial response" to "Enterprise Success Team"
   AND Update deadline to 1 hour from now
   AND Show "Executive escalation" step
   ```

Each customer gets what they're paying for. Your team stays organized.

## Best practices

- **Clear service definitions** - Document what each tier includes so your team knows the expectations
- **Backup assignments** - Use groups instead of individuals so coverage doesn't break during vacations
- **Time zones** - Enterprise customers in different regions shouldn't wait for your local team to start
- **Monthly review** - Check assignment patterns to spot uneven workload before it causes burnout
- **Transparent routing** - Tell customers upfront how their tier affects response speed
