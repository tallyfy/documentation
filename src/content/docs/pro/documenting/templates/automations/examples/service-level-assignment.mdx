title: Service level-based task assignment
---

This example shows how to automatically route [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to different team members based on the service level, package type, or tier selected during process initiation. This ensures customers receive appropriate expertise based on their subscription or purchase level.

## What is the use case for this automation?

Service level-based assignment is valuable for:

- **Tiered customer support**: Basic, Premium, and Enterprise customers get routed to appropriate support teams
- **Sales processes**: Different account executives handle different deal sizes or customer segments  
- **Professional services**: Junior vs. senior consultants assigned based on project complexity
- **Subscription management**: Different teams handle free, pro, and enterprise account setups

## Setting up service-based assignment

### Basic service level routing

Here's how to route tasks based on a service package selection:

**Scenario**: A client onboarding process where Platinum clients get assigned to senior account managers.

1. **Add a service selection field to your kick-off form**:
   - Field type: Dropdown or Radio Button
   - Options: "Basic", "Professional", "Platinum"
   - Label: "Select service package"

2. **Create assignment rules for each service level**:

   **Rule 1: Platinum service assignment**
   ```
   IF (Service Package field) is "Platinum"
   THEN Replace assignee(s) for "Prepare proposal" with "Sarah Chen"
   AND Replace assignee(s) for "Account setup" with "Sarah Chen"
   ```

   **Rule 2: Professional service assignment**
   ```
   IF (Service Package field) is "Professional"  
   THEN Replace assignee(s) for "Prepare proposal" with "Mike Johnson"
   AND Replace assignee(s) for "Account setup" with "Mike Johnson"
   ```

   **Rule 3: Basic service assignment**
   ```
   IF (Service Package field) is "Basic"
   THEN Replace assignee(s) for "Prepare proposal" with "Support Team" group
   AND Replace assignee(s) for "Account setup" with "Support Team" group
   ```

### Advanced patterns

#### Workload-balanced assignment

Instead of assigning to specific individuals, use groups with round-robin assignment:

```
IF (Service Package field) is "Platinum"
THEN Replace assignee(s) for all account management tasks with "Senior Account Managers" group
```

Then configure the group for automatic workload distribution.

#### Multi-criteria assignment

Combine service level with other factors:

```
IF (Service Package field) is "Enterprise"
AND (Industry field) is "Healthcare"
THEN Replace assignee(s) for "Compliance review" with "Healthcare Specialist Team"
```

#### Progressive expertise escalation

Different service levels might need different approval chains:

```
IF (Service Package field) is "Basic"
THEN Hide "Executive review" step

IF (Service Package field) is "Enterprise"
THEN Show "Executive review" step
AND Assign "Executive review" to "C-Suite" group
```

## Real-world example: Technical support tiers

A software company uses service levels to route support tickets:

**Kick-off form fields**:
- Customer tier (dropdown): "Free", "Starter", "Growth", "Enterprise"
- Issue type (dropdown): "Bug", "Feature Request", "Integration Help"

**Automation rules**:

1. **Free tier gets community support**:
   ```
   IF (Customer Tier) is "Free"
   THEN Assign "Initial response" to "Community Managers"
   AND Set deadline to 48 hours
   ```

2. **Starter tier gets standard support**:
   ```
   IF (Customer Tier) is "Starter"
   THEN Assign "Initial response" to "Tier 1 Support"
   AND Set deadline to 24 hours
   ```

3. **Growth tier gets priority support**:
   ```
   IF (Customer Tier) is "Growth"
   THEN Assign "Initial response" to "Tier 2 Support"
   AND Set deadline to 4 hours
   ```

4. **Enterprise gets dedicated support**:
   ```
   IF (Customer Tier) is "Enterprise"
   THEN Assign "Initial response" to "Enterprise Success Team"
   AND Set deadline to 1 hour
   AND Show "Executive escalation" step
   ```

This ensures each customer receives support matching their service agreement while optimizing team resources.

## Best practices

- **Clear service definitions**: Document what each service level includes so assignees understand expectations
- **Backup assignments**: Always have a fallback group assignment in case primary assignees are unavailable
- **Consider time zones**: For global teams, assign based on both service level and customer location
- **Regular review**: Periodically analyze assignment patterns to ensure fair workload distribution
- **Transparent routing**: Let customers know how their service level affects response times and handling
