title: Service level-based task assignment
---

Want to route [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to different team members based on customer service levels? Here's how Tallyfy automatically assigns the right expertise to match each customer's subscription tier - whether they're on your basic plan or your enterprise package.

## When do you need service-based routing?

Think about these scenarios:

- **Tiered customer support**: Your enterprise customers shouldn't wait in the same queue as free users. Different teams, different response times.
- **Sales processes**: Million-dollar deals need your senior closers, not the new hire still learning the ropes  
- **Professional services**: Complex projects get senior consultants. Simple ones? Perfect for junior team members to build experience.
- **Subscription management**: Free trial setups can be handled by anyone, but enterprise onboarding needs your A-team

## Setting up service-based assignment

### Basic service level routing

Let's walk through a real example - routing tasks based on service packages.

**Scenario**: You're onboarding new clients, and your Platinum customers deserve Sarah Chen (your best account manager). Not the intern.

1. **First, add a service selection field to your kick-off form[^1]**:
   - Field type: Dropdown or Radio Button
   - Options: "Basic", "Professional", "Platinum"
   - Label: "Select service package"

2. **Next, create assignment rules for each level**:

   **Rule 1: Platinum service assignment**
   ```
   IF (Service Package field) is "Platinum"
   THEN Replace assignee(s) for "Prepare proposal" with "Sarah Chen"
   AND Replace assignee(s) for "Account setup" with "Sarah Chen"
   ```

   **Rule 2: Professional service assignment**
   ```
   IF (Service Package field) is "Professional"  
   THEN Replace assignee(s) for "Prepare proposal" with "Mike Johnson"
   AND Replace assignee(s) for "Account setup" with "Mike Johnson"
   ```

   **Rule 3: Basic service assignment**
   ```
   IF (Service Package field) is "Basic"
   THEN Replace assignee(s) for "Prepare proposal" with "Support Team" group
   AND Replace assignee(s) for "Account setup" with "Support Team" group
   ```

### Advanced patterns

#### Workload-balanced assignment

What if Sarah's swamped? Don't pile everything on one person - use groups instead:

```
IF (Service Package field) is "Platinum"
THEN Replace assignee(s) for all account management tasks with "Senior Account Managers" group
```

Configure the group for round-robin assignment[^2]. Tallyfy spreads the work evenly.

#### Multi-criteria assignment

Sometimes service level isn't enough. You need more nuance:

```
IF (Service Package field) is "Enterprise"
AND (Industry field) is "Healthcare"
THEN Replace assignee(s) for "Compliance review" with "Healthcare Specialist Team"
```

Now you're matching expertise to both customer tier AND industry. Smart.

#### Progressive expertise escalation

Higher tiers often need more approvals (it's just how business works):

```
IF (Service Package field) is "Basic"
THEN Hide "Executive review" step

IF (Service Package field) is "Enterprise"
THEN Show "Executive review" step
AND Assign "Executive review" to "C-Suite" group
```

## Real-world example: Technical support tiers

Here's how one of our software clients handles 10,000+ support tickets monthly. They stopped drowning in chaos.

**Kick-off form fields**:
- Customer tier (dropdown): "Free", "Starter", "Growth", "Enterprise"
- Issue type (dropdown): "Bug", "Feature Request", "Integration Help"

**Their automation setup**:

1. **Free tier gets community support**:
   ```
   IF (Customer Tier) is "Free"
   THEN Assign "Initial response" to "Community Managers"
   AND Set deadline to 48 hours
   ```

2. **Starter tier gets standard support**:
   ```
   IF (Customer Tier) is "Starter"
   THEN Assign "Initial response" to "Tier 1 Support"
   AND Set deadline to 24 hours
   ```

3. **Growth tier gets priority support**:
   ```
   IF (Customer Tier) is "Growth"
   THEN Assign "Initial response" to "Tier 2 Support"
   AND Set deadline to 4 hours
   ```

4. **Enterprise gets dedicated support**:
   ```
   IF (Customer Tier) is "Enterprise"
   THEN Assign "Initial response" to "Enterprise Success Team"
   AND Set deadline to 1 hour
   AND Show "Executive escalation" step
   ```

Each customer gets exactly what they're paying for. Your team stays sane. Win-win.

## Best practices

- **Clear service definitions**: Your team needs to know what "Enterprise support" actually means - document it
- **Backup assignments**: Sarah takes vacations. Have a fallback group ready (learned this the hard way)
- **Consider time zones**: Enterprise customers in Sydney shouldn't wait for your California team to wake up
- **Regular review**: Check assignment patterns monthly - you'll spot burnout before it happens
- **Transparent routing**: Tell customers upfront how their package affects support speed. No surprises.
