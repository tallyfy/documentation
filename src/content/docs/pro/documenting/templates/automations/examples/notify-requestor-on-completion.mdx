## Notify the requestor when a process completes

Capture who launched a process using an Assignee Picker field, then use an automation rule to send them a notification when it's done. The person who started the process always knows the outcome - no chasing required.

### Common use cases

- **Service requests** - let employees know their IT, HR, or facilities requests are done
- **Approval workflows** - tell requestors whether they got approved or rejected
- **Order processing** - send confirmations when everything ships
- **Document processing** - deliver finished documents to whoever submitted them

### Prerequisites

- Admin or Standard member role to edit templates
- Familiarity with [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) and [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/)

### Setting up requestor notification

<Steps>
1. **Capture the requestor identity**

   Add an **Assignee Picker** field to your kick-off form:
   - Label it clearly - e.g. "Select your name" or "Who's requesting this?"
   - Make the field required
   - Place it at the top of the form

   :::tip[Auto-populate option]
   Pre-select "Launcher" as the default value. Most people are requesting things for themselves anyway.
   :::

2. **Create the notification step**

   Add a final step in your template for the completion notification:
   - **Step type**: Pick "Email Auto-Send" (this sends automatically when the deadline passes)
   - **Step name**: Something like "Notify Requestor of Completion"
   - **Content**: Include completion details, attachments, and next steps
   - **Deadline**: Set it after your last real step completes

3. **Configure the automation rule**

   Go to the template's **Automations** tab:
   - Click **Add Automation**
   - Name it descriptively - e.g. "Assign completion notification to requestor"
   - **IF condition**: Pick your Assignee Picker field and "is not empty"
   - **THEN action**: Choose "Replace Assignees"
   - **Target**: Select your notification step
   - **Source**: Select the same Assignee Picker field

4. **Add completion details using variables**

   Use form field aliases wrapped in `{{ }}` to pull in process data:
   ```
   Hello {{kick_off_form_requestor_name}},

   Your request has been completed.

   Summary:
   - Request type: {{kick_off_form_request_type}}
   - Completed by: {{step_5_completed_by}}

   Attached files: {{step_4_uploaded_documents}}
   ```
</Steps>

### Alternative approaches

#### Multiple notification recipients

1. Add multiple Assignee Picker fields (e.g. "Requestor" and "CC Recipients")
2. Create separate notification steps for each group
3. Set up automation rules to route each notification correctly

#### Conditional notifications based on outcomes

1. Add a dropdown field for process outcome ("Approved", "Rejected", "Pending")
2. Create a notification step per outcome
3. Use conditional visibility automations so only the right notification fires

#### Webhooks for advanced notifications

1. Add a webhook automation on the final step completion
2. Connect it to middleware (Zapier, Make, Power Automate) to:
   - Send formatted HTML emails
   - Pull attachments from other systems
   - Trigger SMS or Slack messages

### Best practices

- **Clear labeling** - name your Assignee Picker field so people know exactly what to pick
- **Test first** - always run a test process before going live
- **Include context** - use variables to pack notifications with useful details
- **Set timing carefully** - if your final data needs processing, add a buffer before the notification deadline

### Troubleshooting

**Notification not sending?**
- Check the Assignee Picker field has someone selected
- Verify the automation rule is active
- Confirm the step type is "Email Auto-Send" - not a regular task
- Email Auto-Send steps trigger when the deadline passes

**Wrong person getting notified?**
- Double-check you selected the right Assignee Picker field in the automation
- Verify what users are selecting in the form

**Missing data in the notification?**
- Check that your variable aliases match the actual form field aliases
- Referenced fields must be filled before the notification step fires

### Example: IT service request completion

1. **Kick-off form** - three fields:
   - Assignee Picker: "Select your name"
   - Request type dropdown
   - Description text area

2. **Process steps**:
   - IT reviews the request
   - IT completes the work
   - IT uploads documentation

3. **Final notification step**:
   - Type: Email Auto-Send
   - Deadline: 30 minutes after "Upload documentation" completes
   - Content: request details plus attached docs
   - Automation: assigns the step to whoever launched the process
