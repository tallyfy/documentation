## Automatically notify the process requestor upon completion

Send automatic notifications to the person who originally launched a process when it reaches completion. This ensures requestors receive confirmations, results, or final documentation without manual intervention.

### Common use cases

This automation pattern works well for:
- **Service requests**: Notify employees when their IT, HR, or facilities requests are complete
- **Approval workflows**: Inform requestors of final approval decisions
- **Order processing**: Send confirmation when orders are fulfilled
- **Document processing**: Deliver completed documents to the original submitter
- **Onboarding**: Confirm when new employee setup is complete

### Prerequisites

- Administrator or Standard user role to edit templates
- Understanding of [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/)
- Basic knowledge of [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/)

### Setting up requestor notification

<Steps>
1. **Capture the requestor identity**
   
   Add an **Assignee Picker** field to your kick-off form:
   - Label it clearly (e.g., "Select your name" or "Who is requesting this?")
   - Make the field required
   - Position it prominently in the kick-off form
   
   :::tip[Auto-populate option]
   Consider pre-selecting "Person who launches this process" as the default value to save users a step.
   :::

2. **Create the notification task**
   
   Add a final task in your template for the completion notification:
   - **Task type**: Choose "Email - Auto Send" for automatic delivery
   - **Task name**: "Notify Requestor of Completion"
   - **Content**: Include relevant completion details and any attachments
   - **Timing**: Set to trigger after the last operational task completes

3. **Configure the automation rule**
   
   In the template's **Automations** tab:
   - Click **Add Automation**
   - Name it "Assign completion notification to requestor"
   - **IF condition**: Select your assignee picker field and "is not empty"
   - **THEN action**: Choose "Replace assignee(s)"
   - **Target**: Select your notification task
   - **Replace with**: Select the same assignee picker field

4. **Add completion details using variables**
   
   Enhance your notification email with process data:
   ```
   Hello {{kick_off_form_requestor_name}},
   
   Your request submitted on {{process_launched_date}} has been completed.
   
   Summary:
   - Request type: {{kick_off_form_request_type}}
   - Completed by: {{step_5_completed_by}}
   - Completion date: {{current_date}}
   
   Attached files: {{step_4_uploaded_documents}}
   ```
</Steps>

### Alternative approaches

#### Using multiple notification recipients

To notify both the requestor and others:
1. Add multiple assignee picker fields (e.g., "Requestor" and "CC Recipients")
2. Create separate notification tasks for each audience
3. Use automation rules to assign each notification appropriately

#### Conditional notifications based on outcomes

Send different notifications based on process results:
1. Add a selection field for process outcome (e.g., "Approved", "Rejected", "Pending")
2. Create multiple notification tasks with outcome-specific content
3. Use conditional visibility to show only the relevant notification

#### Using webhooks for advanced notifications

For complex notification requirements:
1. Set up a webhook on the final task completion
2. Use middleware (Zapier, Make, Power Automate) to:
   - Send formatted HTML emails
   - Include attachments from external systems
   - Send SMS or Slack notifications
   - Update external systems

### Best practices

- **Clear labeling**: Name your assignee picker field clearly so users understand its purpose
- **Test thoroughly**: Launch test processes to verify notifications work correctly
- **Include context**: Add process details using variables so recipients have full context
- **Set appropriate timing**: Consider adding a delay if final data needs processing time
- **Provide next steps**: Include what the requestor should do after receiving the notification

### Troubleshooting

**Notification not sending**:
- Verify the assignee picker field has a value
- Check that the automation rule is active
- Ensure the task type is set to "Email - Auto Send"
- Confirm the task deadline has passed (for auto-send emails)

**Wrong recipient**:
- Verify the correct field is selected in the automation rule
- Check that users are selecting the right person in the assignee picker
- Consider making the field read-only after initial selection

**Missing process data**:
- Ensure variables reference the correct fields
- Check that referenced fields are completed before the notification task
- Test with sample data to verify variable substitution

### Example: IT service request completion

Here's a complete example for an IT service request process:

1. **Kick-off form** includes:
   - Assignee picker: "Select your name"
   - Request type dropdown
   - Description field

2. **Process steps**:
   - IT reviews request
   - IT completes work
   - IT uploads completion documentation

3. **Final notification task**:
   - Type: Email - Auto Send
   - Timing: 30 minutes after "Upload documentation" completes
   - Content includes request details and attached documentation
   - Automation assigns to original requestor

This pattern ensures every service request closes the loop with the person who initiated it.
