## Automatically notify the process requestor upon completion

To notify someone when their process completes, capture who launched it using an assignee picker field, then use automation rules to send them the final notification. That's it.

This keeps everyone in the loop - the person who started a process always knows when it's done, what happened, and gets any deliverables automatically. No more chasing people down for status updates.

### Common use cases

You'll want this for:
- **Service requests**: Let employees know their IT, HR, or facilities requests are done
- **Approval workflows**: Tell requestors whether they got approved or rejected
- **Order processing**: Send order confirmations when everything's shipped
- **Document processing**: Deliver finished documents right to whoever submitted them
- **Onboarding**: Confirm new employee setup is complete

### Prerequisites

- Administrator or Standard user role to edit templates
- Understanding of [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/)
- Basic knowledge of [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/)

### Setting up requestor notification

<Steps>
1. **Capture the requestor identity**
   
   Add an **Assignee Picker** field to your kick-off form:
   - Label it something obvious like "Select your name" or "Who's requesting this?"
   - Make the field required
   - Put it right at the top where people can't miss it
   
   :::tip[Auto-populate option]
   Here's a time-saver: pre-select "Person who launches this process" as the default. Most folks are requesting things for themselves anyway.
   :::

2. **Create the notification task**
   
   Add a final task in your template for the completion notification:
   - **Task type**: Pick "Email - Auto Send" (this sends automatically)
   - **Task name**: Something like "Notify Requestor of Completion"
   - **Content**: Include everything they need - completion details, attachments, the works
   - **Timing**: Set it to fire after your last real task wraps up

3. **Configure the automation rule**
   
   Head to the template's **Automations** tab:
   - Click **Add Automation**
   - Name it something descriptive like "Assign completion notification to requestor"
   - **IF condition**: Pick your assignee picker field and "is not empty"
   - **THEN action**: Choose "Replace assignee(s)"
   - **Target**: Select your notification task
   - **Replace with**: Select that same assignee picker field again

4. **Add completion details using variables**
   
   Make your notification actually useful with process data:
   ```
   Hello `{{kick_off_form_requestor_name}}`,
   
   Your request submitted on `{{process_launched_date}}` has been completed.
   
   Summary:
   - Request type: `{{kick_off_form_request_type}}`
   - Completed by: `{{step_5_completed_by}}`
   - Completion date: `{{current_date}}`
   
   Attached files: `{{step_4_uploaded_documents}}`
   ```
</Steps>

### Alternative approaches

#### Using multiple notification recipients

Need to notify the requestor plus other people? Here's how:
1. Add multiple assignee picker fields ("Requestor" and "CC Recipients" work well)
2. Create separate notification tasks for each group
3. Set up automation rules to route each notification to the right people

#### Conditional notifications based on outcomes

Sometimes you need different messages for different results. Set it up like this:
1. Add a selection field for process outcome ("Approved", "Rejected", "Pending")
2. Create multiple notification tasks - one for each possible outcome
3. Use conditional visibility so only the right notification shows up

#### Using webhooks for advanced notifications

Got complex notification needs? Webhooks are your friend:
1. Set up a webhook on the final task completion
2. Connect it to middleware (Zapier, Make, Power Automate) and you can:
   - Send fancy HTML emails
   - Pull in attachments from other systems
   - Fire off SMS or Slack messages
   - Update external systems

### Best practices

- **Clear labeling**: Name your assignee picker field something obvious - people shouldn't have to guess what it's for
- **Test thoroughly**: Always run a test process before going live. Trust me on this one.
- **Include context**: Pack your notifications with details using variables. Recipients hate vague emails.
- **Set appropriate timing**: If your final data needs processing time, add a delay (30 minutes usually does it)
- **Provide next steps**: Tell people what to do next - don't leave them hanging

### Troubleshooting

**Notification not sending?**
- Check if the assignee picker field actually has someone selected
- Make sure your automation rule is switched on (easy to forget!)
- Verify the task type is "Email - Auto Send" not just a regular task
- For auto-send emails, the deadline needs to pass first - that's what triggers them

**Wrong person getting notified?**
- Double-check you picked the right field in your automation rule
- Watch what users are actually selecting - they might be picking the wrong person
- Pro tip: make the field read-only after someone picks their name

**Missing data in the notification?**
- Your variables might be pointing to the wrong fields
- The fields you're referencing need to be filled out before the notification fires
- Run a test with real data - that usually reveals the problem

### Example: IT service request completion

Let me show you how this works with a real IT service request:

1. **Kick-off form** has three fields:
   - Assignee picker: "Select your name"
   - Request type dropdown
   - Description field

2. **Process steps** are simple:
   - IT reviews the request
   - IT does the work
   - IT uploads any documentation

3. **Final notification task** brings it all together:
   - Type: Email - Auto Send
   - Timing: 30 minutes after "Upload documentation" completes
   - Content includes all the request details plus attached docs
   - Automation assigns it to whoever started this whole thing

Simple.

Every service request closes the loop automatically - the person who asked for help knows exactly when it's done and gets everything they need.
