import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This example shows how to automatically set [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) deadlines that count backwards from important dates. Instead of setting deadlines after something happens, these automations ensure preparation tasks complete before critical dates.

## What is the use case for countdown deadlines?

Countdown deadlines are essential for:

- **Meeting preparation**: Send reminders 1 day before scheduled meetings
- **Event planning**: Complete setup tasks 2 weeks before the event date
- **Launch coordination**: Finish marketing materials 1 week before product launch
- **Contract renewals**: Start renewal discussions 30 days before expiration
- **Compliance deadlines**: Submit reports 5 days before regulatory due dates

The key is working backwards from a fixed future date to ensure everything is ready on time.

## How do I create countdown deadline automations?

<Steps>
1. **Add a date field to capture the target date**
   
   In your kick-off form or early step, add a **Date** field to capture the important date:
   - "Meeting date"
   - "Event date"
   - "Launch date"
   - "Contract expiration date"
   - "Regulatory deadline"

2. **Create tasks that need to complete before that date**
   
   Add steps to your [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) for preparation activities:
   - "Send meeting agenda"
   - "Finalize event venue"
   - "Complete marketing materials"
   - "Prepare renewal proposal"

3. **Set up deadline automation rules**
   
   Create automation rules that calculate deadlines backwards from your date field:
   
   **Example: Meeting reminder 1 day before**
   ```
   IF (Meeting Date field) is not empty
   THEN Set deadline for "Send meeting reminder" 
        to 1 day before (Meeting Date field)
   ```
   
   **Example: Event preparation 2 weeks before**
   ```
   IF (Event Date field) is not empty
   THEN Set deadline for "Finalize catering order" 
        to 14 days before (Event Date field)
   ```
</Steps>

## Real-world countdown examples

### Sales funnel management

**Scenario**: Schedule follow-up activities before a prospect meeting.

**Kick-off form field**: "Scheduled meeting date"

**Automation rules**:

1. **Pre-meeting research deadline**:
   ```
   IF (Scheduled Meeting Date) exists
   THEN Set deadline for "Complete prospect research" 
        to 3 days before (Scheduled Meeting Date)
   ```

2. **Agenda preparation deadline**:
   ```
   IF (Scheduled Meeting Date) exists
   THEN Set deadline for "Send meeting agenda" 
        to 1 day before (Scheduled Meeting Date)
   ```

3. **Day-of reminder**:
   ```
   IF (Scheduled Meeting Date) exists
   THEN Set deadline for "Meeting day checklist" 
        to 2 hours before (Scheduled Meeting Date)
   ```

### Podcast publishing workflow

**Scenario**: Coordinate all tasks leading up to a podcast launch.

**Kick-off form field**: "Podcast launch date"

**Automation rules**:

1. **Audio file deadline**:
   ```
   IF (Launch Date) exists
   THEN Set deadline for "Upload final audio" 
        to 1 week before (Launch Date)
   ```

2. **Promotional content deadline**:
   ```
   IF (Launch Date) exists
   THEN Set deadline for "Create social media posts" 
        to 3 days before (Launch Date)
   ```

3. **Final review deadline**:
   ```
   IF (Launch Date) exists
   THEN Set deadline for "Final quality check" 
        to 1 day before (Launch Date)
   ```

### International shipping process

**Scenario**: Ensure customs documentation is ready before shipment arrival.

**Step 1 fields**: 
- Location (dropdown): "Domestic" or "International"
- Expected arrival date (date field)

**Automation rules**:

1. **Show customs check for international only**:
   ```
   IF (Location) is "International"
   THEN Show "Verify customs documentation"
   ```

2. **Set customs deadline before arrival**:
   ```
   IF (Location) is "International"
   THEN Set deadline for "Verify customs documentation"
        to 1 week before (Expected Arrival Date)
   ```

This ensures international shipments have proper documentation well before arrival.

## Advanced countdown patterns

### Multiple countdown deadlines from one date

Set several deadlines counting back from the same target date:

```
IF (Contract End Date) exists
THEN:
- Set "Initial renewal discussion" to 60 days before (Contract End Date)
- Set "Prepare renewal proposal" to 45 days before (Contract End Date)
- Set "Send renewal offer" to 30 days before (Contract End Date)
- Set "Final negotiation" to 15 days before (Contract End Date)
```

### Conditional countdown deadlines

Different lead times based on other factors:

```
IF (Event Type) is "Small Meeting" 
AND (Event Date) exists
THEN Set "Room setup" to 1 hour before (Event Date)

IF (Event Type) is "Large Conference"
AND (Event Date) exists  
THEN Set "Room setup" to 1 day before (Event Date)
```

### Working hours consideration

Tallyfy automatically adjusts deadlines to fall within working hours. If "1 day before meeting" calculates to a Sunday, the deadline moves to Friday (or the last working day).

## Best practices

- **Buffer time**: Add extra time for critical tasks (e.g., 2 days before instead of 1)
- **Clear task names**: Include the timing in task names like "Send agenda (1 day before meeting)"
- **Required date fields**: Make date fields required if countdown deadlines depend on them
- **Fallback deadlines**: Set default deadlines in case date fields are empty
- **Test calculations**: Verify deadlines calculate correctly, especially around weekends

:::tip[Deadline calculation order]
Tallyfy calculates countdown deadlines when:
1. The process launches (if the date field is in kick-off form)
2. A step containing the date field is completed
3. The date field value changes

This ensures deadlines update dynamically based on the most current information.
