import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Tallyfy lets you set [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) deadlines that count backwards from a target date. Your meeting agenda can be automatically due 1 day before the meeting. Preparation tasks always finish before the critical date arrives.

## When to use countdown deadlines

- **Meeting prep** - reminders 1 day before scheduled meetings
- **Event planning** - setup tasks due 2 weeks before the event
- **Launch coordination** - marketing materials due 1 week before launch
- **Contract renewals** - start discussions 30 days before expiration
- **Compliance** - submit reports 5 days before regulatory due dates

You're working backwards from a fixed date. Everything lands on time.

## How to create countdown deadline automations

<Steps>
1. **Add a date field for the target date**

   In your kick-off form[^1] or an early step, add a **Date** field (e.g. "Meeting date", "Event date", "Contract expiration date"). Tallyfy requires the field type to be `date` for deadline automations.

2. **Add preparation steps**

   Add steps to your [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) for the work that needs to happen before that date (e.g. "Send meeting agenda", "Finalize event venue").

3. **Create deadline automation rules**

   Set up rules that calculate deadlines backwards from your date field:

   **Example - meeting reminder 1 day before:**
   ```
   IF (Meeting Date field) is not empty
   THEN Set deadline for "Send meeting reminder"
        to 1 day before (Meeting Date field)
   ```

   **Example - event prep 2 weeks before:**
   ```
   IF (Event Date field) is not empty
   THEN Set deadline for "Finalize catering order"
        to 14 days before (Event Date field)
   ```
</Steps>

## Real-world examples

### Sales funnel

**Kick-off form field**: "Scheduled meeting date"

```
IF (Scheduled Meeting Date) exists
THEN Set deadline for "Complete prospect research"
     to 3 days before (Scheduled Meeting Date)
```

```
IF (Scheduled Meeting Date) exists
THEN Set deadline for "Send meeting agenda"
     to 1 day before (Scheduled Meeting Date)
```

```
IF (Scheduled Meeting Date) exists
THEN Set deadline for "Meeting day checklist"
     to 2 hours before (Scheduled Meeting Date)
```

Valid deadline units are minutes, hours, days, weeks, and months.

### Podcast publishing

**Kick-off form field**: "Podcast launch date"

```
IF (Launch Date) exists
THEN Set deadline for "Upload final audio"
     to 1 week before (Launch Date)
```

```
IF (Launch Date) exists
THEN Set deadline for "Create social media posts"
     to 3 days before (Launch Date)
```

```
IF (Launch Date) exists
THEN Set deadline for "Final quality check"
     to 1 day before (Launch Date)
```

### International shipping

**Step 1 fields**: Location (dropdown) and Expected arrival date (date field)

```
IF (Location) is "International"
THEN Show "Verify customs documentation"
```

```
IF (Location) is "International"
THEN Set deadline for "Verify customs documentation"
     to 1 week before (Expected Arrival Date)
```

International shipments won't get stuck at customs.

## Advanced patterns

### Multiple deadlines from one date

Create separate automation rules that all reference the same date field:

```
IF (Contract End Date) exists
THEN Set "Initial renewal discussion" to 60 days before (Contract End Date)
```
```
IF (Contract End Date) exists
THEN Set "Prepare renewal proposal" to 45 days before (Contract End Date)
```
```
IF (Contract End Date) exists
THEN Set "Send renewal offer" to 30 days before (Contract End Date)
```

Each rule is a separate automation - they all fire independently based on the same date.

### Conditional countdown deadlines

Different lead times based on other field values:

```
IF (Event Type) is "Small Meeting"
AND (Event Date) exists
THEN Set "Room setup" to 1 hour before (Event Date)

IF (Event Type) is "Large Conference"
AND (Event Date) exists
THEN Set "Room setup" to 1 day before (Event Date)
```

### Working hours adjustment

Tallyfy adjusts deadlines to fall within your org's configured working hours[^2]. If a calculated deadline lands on a non-working day, it shifts to the next available working day and time.

## Tips

- **Add buffer** - use 2 days before instead of 1 for critical tasks
- **Name tasks clearly** - include timing like "Send agenda (1 day before meeting)"
- **Require date fields** - if countdown deadlines depend on a date, make that field required
- **Set fallback deadlines** - add default deadlines on steps in case date fields are left empty
- **Test around weekends** - verify deadlines calculate correctly near non-working days

:::tip[When deadlines recalculate]
Tallyfy recalculates countdown deadlines at two key points:
1. When the process launches (if the date field is in the kick-off form)
2. When you complete a step that contains the date field

Your deadlines stay accurate based on these triggers.
