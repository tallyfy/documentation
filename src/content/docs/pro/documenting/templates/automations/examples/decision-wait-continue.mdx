  three automations together - one for the YES path that skips waiting and shows the

  hiding the next step and a third automation that triggers when the waiting step
  completes to reveal the next step.

## Automation Example: Decision with Waiting Step

Need your process to ask "Is something ready?" and either proceed immediately or wait? This pattern handles that - but it requires three automations, not two.

### The pattern

Here's what you want:
- **YES** → Skip waiting, go directly to the next step
- **NO** → Show a waiting step, then continue when it's done

Most users create two automations (one for YES, one for NO) and stop there. That's the mistake.

### Example: Payment confirmation workflow

Let's say you have three steps:
1. **Decision step**: "Has the customer paid?" (YES/NO field)
2. **Waiting step**: "Hold until payment received" (hidden by default)
3. **Confirmation step**: "Record payment evidence" (hidden by default)

### Required automations (all three are necessary)

**Automation 1 - YES path** (customer already paid):
```
IF (Payment field) is "Yes"
THEN HIDE "Hold until payment received" step
THEN SHOW "Record payment evidence" step
```

Customer paid? Skip the waiting step, go straight to confirmation.

**Automation 2 - NO path** (customer hasn't paid yet):
```
IF (Payment field) is "No"
THEN SHOW "Hold until payment received" step
THEN HIDE "Record payment evidence" step
```

Customer hasn't paid? Show the waiting step. Hide confirmation for now.

**Automation 3 - Waiting complete** (the one people forget):
```
IF "Hold until payment received" step is Completed
THEN SHOW "Record payment evidence" step
```

When the waiting step is done, show the confirmation step.

:::warning[Common mistake]
Most users stop after automations 1 and 2. Without automation 3, the confirmation step stays hidden forever after the waiting step is completed. The NO path never reaches the confirmation.
:::

### Why all three automations?

Think about what happens with only two automations:

| Scenario | What happens |
|----------|--------------|
| YES selected | Works fine - confirmation step appears |
| NO selected | Waiting step appears, confirmation hidden |
| Waiting step completed | **Nothing!** Confirmation stays hidden |

Automation 3 completes the NO path. Without it, the workflow dead-ends.

### Summary

When combining decisions with waiting steps:
1. Create your YES automation (skip waiting, show next step)
2. Create your NO automation (show waiting, hide next step)
3. **Don't forget**: Create a "waiting completed" automation to show the next step

All three automations work together. Miss one, and the workflow breaks.
