## Decision with waiting step

This pattern requires three automations, not two. It handles "Is something ready?" - either proceed immediately or wait until it is.

### The pattern

- **YES** - skip waiting, go directly to the next step
- **NO** - show a waiting step, then continue when it's done

Most people create two automations (one for YES, one for NO) and stop there. That's the mistake.

### Example: payment confirmation

Say you have three steps:
1. **Decision step** - "Has the customer paid?" (YES/NO field)
2. **Waiting step** - "Hold until payment received" (hidden by default)
3. **Confirmation step** - "Record payment evidence" (hidden by default)

### All three automations

**Automation 1 - YES path** (customer already paid):
```
IF (Payment field) is "Yes"
THEN HIDE "Hold until payment received" step
THEN SHOW "Record payment evidence" step
```

Customer paid? Skip the wait, go straight to confirmation.

**Automation 2 - NO path** (customer hasn't paid yet):
```
IF (Payment field) is "No"
THEN SHOW "Hold until payment received" step
THEN HIDE "Record payment evidence" step
```

Haven't paid? Show the waiting step. Hide confirmation for now.

**Automation 3 - Waiting complete** (the one people forget):
```
IF "Hold until payment received" step is Completed
THEN SHOW "Record payment evidence" step
```

This is the critical piece. When the waiting step finishes, it reveals the confirmation step.

:::warning[Common mistake]
Without automation 3, the confirmation step stays hidden forever after the waiting step completes. The NO path dead-ends.
:::

### Why you need all three

Here's what happens with only two automations:

| Scenario | What happens |
|----------|--------------|
| YES selected | Works fine - confirmation step appears |
| NO selected | Waiting step appears, confirmation hidden |
| Waiting step completed | **Nothing!** Confirmation stays hidden |

Automation 3 closes the loop on the NO path.
