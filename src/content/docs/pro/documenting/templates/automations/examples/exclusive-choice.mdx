## Automation Example: Exclusive Choice (Pick One Path)

Sometimes you need to choose only **one** path out of several options in a process. This is called an "exclusive choice".

*(This diagram shows choosing between Path A OR Path B, but not both)*

In Tallyfy, you create multiple [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) rules with different conditions. Only the rule whose condition gets met will run its action, so the process follows just one path.

### Example: Different Onboarding Steps Based on Role

Consider a new employee onboarding [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) where you need different steps for "Field Employee" or "Office Employee" roles.

First, create a step asking for the employee's role. Use a **Radio Button** [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) since users can only pick *one* option.

Next, you would create two separate [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) rules (likely using Visibility Actions):

- **Rule 1:**
  ```
  IF (Role field) is "Field worker"
  THEN SHOW steps [List of steps specific to Field workers]
  ```

- **Rule 2:**
  ```
  IF (Role field) is "Office worker"
  THEN SHOW steps [List of steps specific to Office workers]
  ```

Since the Role field can only be *one* option, only *one* automation rule runs. The process shows the correct steps for either Field or Office employees, never both.

### Summary

Separate automation rules with mutually exclusive conditions (like radio button fields) create processes that automatically follow one specific path.
