## Exclusive choice - pick one path

Exclusive choice automation sends your process down exactly **one** path from multiple options based on a condition. It's the "pick A or B, never both" pattern.

![BPMN diagram showing exclusive choice gateway with Path A or Path B branching options](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy/pro/bpmn-exclusive-choice-gateway.png)
*(Choose Path A OR Path B - not both)*

You set up multiple [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) rules, each with its own condition. When someone fills out a form or completes a task, Tallyfy checks which condition matches and runs only that rule. One path. That's it.

### Example - different onboarding steps by role

Say you're onboarding new employees. Field workers need safety training and equipment setup. Office workers need IT access and desk assignments. Same [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) - completely different steps.

Add a step asking for the employee's role using a **Radio Button** [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) (radio buttons only allow *one* selection).

Then create two [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) rules using Visibility Actions[^1]:

- **Rule 1:**
  ```
  IF (Role field) is "Field worker"
  THEN SHOW steps [List of steps specific to Field workers]
  ```

- **Rule 2:**
  ```
  IF (Role field) is "Office worker"
  THEN SHOW steps [List of steps specific to Office workers]
  ```
  ![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy/pro/desktop-light-office-worker-exclusive-choice.png)

The Role field can only hold *one* value - so only *one* rule fires. Field workers see safety protocols and equipment checklists. Office workers see IT setup and workspace prep. Never both.

The key: use conditions that can't be true at the same time (like radio button options). Tallyfy picks the right path automatically.
