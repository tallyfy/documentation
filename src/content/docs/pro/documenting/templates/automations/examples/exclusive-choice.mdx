## Exclusive choice pattern. Select one path from multiple options

Exclusive choice is a type of decision-making that allows you to select one path from multiple options. This is a common pattern in business [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) where you need to make a decision based on a set of conditions.

In Tallyfy, you can create 2 individual [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) to achieve an exclusive choice pattern. Each automation will have a different condition, and only one of them will be executed based on the conditions being met.

## Example

Let's consider a New employee onboarding [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). When the process is initiated, we will have a first step to gather some basic information about the new employee, In this particular case, our process demands a different set of actions based on the employee's role inside the company. If it's a Field employee, we need a different set of actions to be executed, If it's an Office employee, we need to execute different actions instead.

We will start by creating a [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) of type **Radio button** on the first step to gather the employee's role, this is because radio buttons allows us to have defined options and only one of them can be selected. We will have 2 options, Field employee and Office employee.

After that, we will create 2 [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/), one for each role, and we will set the conditions to be met for each automation to be executed.

- **Automation 1**: If the employee's role is Field worker, then execute the actions for Field employee.

- **Automation 2**: If the employee's role is Office worker, then execute the actions for Office employee.

By doing this, we are creating an exclusive choice pattern in our [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), where only one of the automations will be executed based on the employee's role.

## Summary

Exclusive choice is a powerful pattern that allows you to make decisions based on specific conditions, enabling you to select one path from multiple options in your business processes.
