## Automation Example: Exclusive Choice (Pick One Path)

Want your process to take different paths based on specific conditions? You need exclusive choice automation - where only **one** path gets selected from multiple options. Simple.

*(This diagram shows choosing between Path A OR Path B, but not both)*

Here's how it works in Tallyfy. You set up multiple [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) rules, each with its own condition. When someone fills out a form or completes a task, Tallyfy checks which condition matches - then runs only that specific rule. Your process follows exactly one path, not two or three.

### Example: Different Onboarding Steps Based on Role

Let's say you're onboarding new employees. Field workers need safety training and equipment setup. Office workers need IT access and desk assignments. Same onboarding [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), completely different steps.

Start with a step that asks for the employee's role. You'll want a **Radio Button** [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) here (since they can only pick *one* option).

Now comes the interesting part. Create two separate [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) rules - typically using Visibility Actions:

- **Rule 1:**
  ```
  IF (Role field) is "Field worker"
  THEN SHOW steps [List of steps specific to Field workers]
  ```

- **Rule 2:**
  ```
  IF (Role field) is "Office worker"
  THEN SHOW steps [List of steps specific to Office workers]
  ```

Think about what happens next. The Role field can only have *one* value, right? That means only *one* automation rule fires. Field workers see their safety protocols and equipment checklists. Office workers see IT setup and workspace preparation. Never both.

### Summary

Create separate automation rules with conditions that can't be true at the same time (like radio button selections). Your process automatically chooses the right path - no manual intervention needed.
