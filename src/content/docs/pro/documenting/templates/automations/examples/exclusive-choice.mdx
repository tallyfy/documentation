## Exclusive choice pattern. Select one path from multiple options

Exclusive choice is a type of decision-making that allows you to select one path from multiple options. This is a common pattern in business processes where you need to make a decision based on a set of conditions.

In Tallyfy, you can create 2 individual automations to achieve an exclusive choice pattern. Each automation will have a different condition, and only one of them will be executed based on the conditions being met.

## Example

Let's consider a New employee onboarding process. When the process is initiated, we will have a first step to gather some basic information about the new employee, In this particular case, our process demands a different set of actions based on the employee's role inside the company. If it's a Field employee, we need a different set of actions to be executed, If it's an Office employee, we need to execute different actions instead.

We will start by creating a form field of type **Radio button** on the first step to gather the employee's role, this is because radio buttons allows us to have defined options and only one of them can be selected. We will have 2 options, Field employee and Office employee.

After that, we will create 2 automations, one for each role, and we will set the conditions to be met for each automation to be executed.

- **Automation 1**: If the employee's role is Field worker, then execute the actions for Field employee.

- **Automation 2**: If the employee's role is Office worker, then execute the actions for Office employee.

By doing this, we are creating an exclusive choice pattern in our process, where only one of the automations will be executed based on the employee's role.

## Summary

Exclusive choice is a powerful pattern that allows you to make decisions based on specific conditions, enabling you to select one path from multiple options in your business processes.
