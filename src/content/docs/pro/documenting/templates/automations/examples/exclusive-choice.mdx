## Automation Example: Exclusive Choice (Pick One Path)

Sometimes in a process, you need to choose only **one** path out of several options based on certain information. This is called an "exclusive choice".

*(This diagram shows choosing between Path A OR Path B, but not both)*

In Tallyfy, you handle this by setting up multiple [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) rules, each with a different condition (IF). Only the rule whose condition is met will run its action (THEN), making the process follow just one path.

### Example: Different Onboarding Steps Based on Role

Imagine a new employee onboarding [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). You need different steps depending on whether the new hire is a "Field Employee" or an "Office Employee".

First, you'd create a step early in the process to ask for the employee's role. A good way is using a **Radio Button** [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/), because the user can only pick *one* option.

Next, you would create two separate [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) rules (likely using Visibility Actions):

- **Rule 1:**
  ```
  IF (Role field) is "Field worker"
  THEN SHOW steps [List of steps specific to Field workers]
  ```

- **Rule 2:**
  ```
  IF (Role field) is "Office worker"
  THEN SHOW steps [List of steps specific to Office workers]
  ```

Because the Role field can only be *one* of these options, only *one* of these automation rules will run. This ensures the process shows the correct set of steps for either a Field or Office employee, but never both.

### Summary

Using separate automation rules with conditions that can't both be true at the same time (like using a radio button field) lets you create processes that automatically follow one specific path out of several options.
