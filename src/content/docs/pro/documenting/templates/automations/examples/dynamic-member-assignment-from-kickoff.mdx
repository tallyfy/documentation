description: This automation enables dynamic task assignment by using assignee picker
  fields in kick-off forms to let process launchers select specific team members for
  different roles which then automatically assigns tasks to the chosen people through
  conditional automation rules.

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This Tallyfy example shows how to automatically assign [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to specific team members based on selections made in the kick-off form. This is useful when the person launching the process needs to delegate work to different team members depending on the situation.

## What is the use case for this automation?

Consider these scenarios:

- A project coordinator launches a client onboarding process and selects which account manager should handle the client
- A manager initiates a new hire process and chooses which HR specialist should guide the onboarding
- A requester starts a purchase approval process and nominates an assistant to help gather documentation

The key is that task assignment isn't fixed in the template - it's decided when the process launches.

## How do I set up dynamic member assignment?

<Steps>
1. **Add assignee picker fields to your kick-off form**
   
   Edit your template's kick-off form and add **Assignee Picker** fields for each role you want to assign dynamically. For example:
   - "Select primary agent"
   - "Choose project assistant (optional)"
   - "Assign technical reviewer"
   
   Label these fields clearly so the person launching knows who they're selecting for each role.

2. **Create automation rules for each assignment**
   
   For each assignee picker field, create an automation rule:
   
   **Example 1: Assign primary agent to multiple steps**
   ```
   IF (Primary Agent field) is not empty
   THEN Replace assignee(s) for steps 1, 2, and 3 with (Primary Agent field)
   ```
   
   **Example 2: Conditionally assign assistant to specific tasks**
   ```
   IF (Project Assistant field) is not empty
   THEN Add assignee (Project Assistant field) to steps 4 through 10
   ```

3. **Consider using groups for fallback assignments**
   
   If someone might not be selected, ensure tasks still get assigned:
   ```
   IF (Technical Reviewer field) is empty
   THEN Assign "Technical Review Team" group to step "Technical Review"
   ```
</Steps>

## Advanced patterns

### Combining member selection with other conditions

You can create more sophisticated rules by combining the assignee picker with other conditions:

```
IF (Priority field) is "Urgent" 
AND (Senior Manager field) is not empty
THEN Replace assignee(s) for "Final Approval" with (Senior Manager field)
```

### Multiple assignee pickers working together

Sometimes you need different people for different parts of the process:

- **Initial stages**: Assigned to member selected in "Project Lead" field
- **Middle stages**: Assigned to member selected in "Technical Expert" field  
- **Final stages**: Assigned to member selected in "Quality Reviewer" field

Each assignee picker field can control different sets of tasks, creating a fully customized workflow based on kick-off selections.

:::tip[Best practices]
- Make assignee picker fields required if tasks won't function without specific assignments
- Use clear, descriptive labels so launchers know which role they're selecting
- Consider adding help text to explain each person's responsibilities
- Test your Tallyfy automations to ensure tasks get assigned correctly
