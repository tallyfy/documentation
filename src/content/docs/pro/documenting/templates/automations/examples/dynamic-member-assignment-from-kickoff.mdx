import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Assignee picker fields in kick-off forms[^1] let the person launching a process choose who handles specific [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/). Tallyfy's automation rules[^2] then assign those chosen people automatically - no hard-coded assignments needed.

## When to use this

- A coordinator launches client onboarding and picks which account manager handles that client
- A manager starts a new hire process and selects the right HR specialist (Sarah for tech hires, Mike for sales)
- Someone requests a purchase approval and picks their assistant to gather documentation

Task assignment stays flexible. The launcher decides who gets what.

## Setting it up

<Steps>
1. **Add assignee picker fields to your kick-off form**

   Open your template's kick-off form. Add **Assignee Picker** fields for each role you want assigned dynamically:
   - "Select primary agent"
   - "Choose project assistant (optional)"
   - "Assign technical reviewer"

   Write clear labels - the launcher needs to know exactly who they're picking and why.

2. **Create an automation rule for each assignment**

   Each assignee picker field needs its own rule. Tallyfy supports three assignment verbs: **Add Assignees** (keeps existing ones), **Replace Assignees** (swaps them out), and **Clear assignees** (removes all).

   **Example 1: Replace assignees on multiple steps**
   ```
   IF (Primary Agent field) is not empty
   THEN Replace assignee(s) for steps 1, 2, and 3 with (Primary Agent field)
   ```

   **Example 2: Add an assistant to specific steps**
   ```
   IF (Project Assistant field) is not empty
   THEN Add assignee (Project Assistant field) to steps 4 through 10
   ```

3. **Use groups as fallback assignments**

   If someone doesn't pick anyone, you still need those tasks covered:
   ```
   IF (Technical Reviewer field) is empty
   THEN Assign "Technical Review Team" group to step "Technical Review"
   ```
</Steps>

## Advanced patterns

### Combining with other conditions

Mix assignee pickers with other form field conditions using AND/OR logic:

```
IF (Priority field) is "Urgent"
AND (Senior Manager field) is not empty
THEN Replace assignee(s) for "Final Approval" with (Senior Manager field)
```

Urgent requests go to the senior manager you picked. Regular ones follow the normal approval chain.

### Multiple pickers for different stages

Use separate assignee picker fields when different process stages need different people:

- **Initial stages**: Assigned to the "Project Lead" picker selection
- **Middle stages**: Handed to the "Technical Expert" picker selection
- **Final stages**: Goes to the "Quality Reviewer" picker selection

Each picker controls its own set of steps independently.

:::tip[Best practices]
- Mark assignee picker fields as required if tasks can't proceed without someone assigned
- Use plain labels - don't make people guess what "SME Resource" means
- Add help text explaining what each role will do
- Test with real scenarios before going live - launch test processes and verify the right people get assigned
