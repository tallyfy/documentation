description: This automation enables dynamic task assignment by using assignee picker
  fields in kick-off forms to let process launchers select specific team members for
  different roles which then automatically assigns tasks to the chosen people through
  conditional automation rules.

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Want to let process launchers pick who does what? Tallyfy's assignee picker fields make it happen. You can automatically assign [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to team members based on selections made right in the kick-off form[^1] - perfect when different situations need different people.

## What is the use case for this automation?

Here's when this really shines:

- A project coordinator launches a client onboarding process and picks which account manager should handle that specific client
- A manager starts a new hire process and chooses the HR specialist who'll guide the onboarding (maybe Sarah for tech hires, Mike for sales roles)
- Someone requests a purchase approval and nominates their assistant to help gather all the documentation

The beauty here? Task assignment isn't locked into the template. It's flexible. The person launching decides who gets what work, right when they need to.

## How do I set up dynamic member assignment?

<Steps>
1. **Add assignee picker fields to your kick-off form**
   
   Head into your template's kick-off form. Add **Assignee Picker** fields for each role you want to assign dynamically. Some examples that work well:
   - "Select primary agent"
   - "Choose project assistant (optional)"
   - "Assign technical reviewer"
   
   Make sure these labels are crystal clear - the person launching needs to know exactly who they're selecting and why.

2. **Create automation rule[^2]s for each assignment**
   
   For each assignee picker field, you'll need an automation rule. Here's how they look:
   
   **Example 1: Assign primary agent to multiple steps**
   ```
   IF (Primary Agent field) is not empty
   THEN Replace assignee(s) for steps 1, 2, and 3 with (Primary Agent field)
   ```
   
   **Example 2: Conditionally assign assistant to specific tasks**
   ```
   IF (Project Assistant field) is not empty
   THEN Add assignee (Project Assistant field) to steps 4 through 10
   ```

3. **Consider using groups for fallback assignments**
   
   What if someone doesn't pick anyone? You still need those tasks assigned. Here's the fix:
   ```
   IF (Technical Reviewer field) is empty
   THEN Assign "Technical Review Team" group to step "Technical Review"
   ```
</Steps>

## Advanced patterns

### Combining member selection with other conditions

Want to get fancy? You can mix assignee pickers with other conditions for really smart routing:

```
IF (Priority field) is "Urgent" 
AND (Senior Manager field) is not empty
THEN Replace assignee(s) for "Final Approval" with (Senior Manager field)
```

This means urgent requests go straight to the senior manager you picked. Regular ones? They follow the normal approval chain.

### Multiple assignee pickers working together

Sometimes different process stages need different experts. No problem - just use multiple assignee picker fields:

- **Initial stages**: Goes to whoever's selected in the "Project Lead" field
- **Middle stages**: Handed off to the person in "Technical Expert" field  
- **Final stages**: Wraps up with whoever's in "Quality Reviewer" field

Each picker controls its own set of tasks. The result? A workflow that adapts completely to who's available and best suited for each part.

:::tip[Best practices]
- Make assignee picker fields required if tasks won't work without someone assigned (trust me, you'll thank yourself later)
- Write labels that make sense to the person launching - they shouldn't have to guess what "SME Resource" means
- Add help text explaining what each person will actually do
- Test your automations with real scenarios. Seriously. Launch a few test processes and make sure the right people get the right work.
