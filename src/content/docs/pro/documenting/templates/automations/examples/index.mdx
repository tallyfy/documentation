## Automation example catalog

Browse these practical Tallyfy automation examples to quickly find patterns that match your needs. Each example includes step-by-step instructions and real-world scenarios.

### Assignment automations

**[Automatically assign to process requestor](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/examples/assign-step-to-requestor/)**  
Capture who launched the process and automatically assign them to receive final results or notifications in Tallyfy.

**[Dynamic member assignment from kick-off forms](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/examples/dynamic-member-assignment-from-kickoff/)**  
Let the process launcher choose team members from dropdowns to handle specific tasks dynamically.

**[Service level-based task assignment](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/examples/service-level-assignment/)**  
Route tasks to different teams based on customer tier (Basic, Premium, Enterprise) or service package.

### Workflow control patterns

**[Exclusive choice (pick one path)](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/examples/exclusive-choice/)**  
Create processes that follow different paths based on selections - like different onboarding for office vs. field employees.

**[Synchronization (wait for multiple approvals)](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/examples/synchronization/)**  
Ensure all required approvals complete before proceeding - like waiting for both HR and manager sign-off.

**[Multi-level approval loops](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/examples/multi-level-approval-loops/)**  
Build approval chains where rejections automatically reopen previous steps for corrections.

### Time-based automations

**[Countdown deadline automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/examples/countdown-deadline-automation/)**  
Set deadlines that count backwards from important dates - like sending agendas 1 day before meetings.

**[Combined visibility and deadline rules](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/examples/combined-visibility-deadline-rules/)**  
Show conditional steps with dynamic deadlines - like international shipping checks due before arrival dates.
