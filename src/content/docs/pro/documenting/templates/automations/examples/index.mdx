## Automation example catalog

Looking for the exact automation pattern you need? You're in the right place. Here's our complete collection of ready-to-use Tallyfy automation examples - each one tested in real business workflows with step-by-step setup instructions.

### Assignment automations

**[Automatically assign to process requestor](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/examples/assign-step-to-requestor/)**  
Need to send results back to whoever started the process? This automation captures the requestor and assigns them tasks automatically - no manual tracking needed.

**[Dynamic member assignment from kick-off forms](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/examples/dynamic-member-assignment-from-kickoff/)**  
Your process launcher can pick team members right from dropdown menus. Perfect when different projects need different people.

**[Service level-based task assignment](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/examples/service-level-assignment/)**  
Premium customers get premium support teams. This pattern routes tasks based on customer tier (Basic, Premium, Enterprise) or service package - automatically.

### Workflow control patterns

**[Exclusive choice (pick one path)](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/examples/exclusive-choice/)**  
Sometimes your process needs to go left or right - never both. Think office employees getting IT setup while field workers get equipment training. Different paths, same process.

**[Synchronization (wait for multiple approvals)](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/examples/synchronization/)**  
Can't move forward until HR and your manager both approve? This pattern makes sure all required sign-offs happen before the next step unlocks. No more chasing people.

**[Multi-level approval loops](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/examples/multi-level-approval-loops/)**  
What happens when someone rejects a request? This automation sends it back for fixes, then restarts the approval chain. Smart.

### Time-based automations

**[Countdown deadline automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/examples/countdown-deadline-automation/)**  
Meeting next Tuesday? This automation counts backwards to set deadlines - agendas go out Monday, room bookings due Friday. Works with any date you specify.

**[Combined visibility and deadline rules](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/examples/combined-visibility-deadline-rules/)**  
Here's where it gets interesting: show international shipping tasks only when needed AND set their deadlines based on arrival dates. Two automations working together.
