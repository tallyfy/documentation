## Practical automation examples and patterns

This section shows real-world examples of how you can use Tallyfy's [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) rules to solve common business problems and make your processes smarter.

### What you need
- A basic grasp of how Tallyfy automations work (Conditions and Actions).
- Permission to create or edit [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).
- To be comfortable with adding [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) and steps to templates.

### Why look at examples?
- **Build faster**: Learn from examples instead of figuring everything out yourself.
- **Get ideas**: See different ways automations can improve your processes.
- **Solve problems**: Find examples that show how to handle situations you face.
- **Learn easier**: Understand how automations work by seeing them used in real scenarios.

### Example types covered
The examples in the following pages show how to handle common situations like:
- Sending approvals to different people based on conditions.
- Assigning [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) automatically based on form answers.
- Showing different steps based on form selections.
- Creating different paths for different departments.
- Sending notifications based on task status.
- Escalating tasks if they are overdue.
