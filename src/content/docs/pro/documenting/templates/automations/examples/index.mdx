## Automation examples

Automations are a powerful feature in Tallyfy that allow you to automate decision-making in your processes based on certain conditions that you can configure. This concept is much like decision-making in our everyday lives. However, sometimes it can be really hard to understand how to use automations in your processes. In this section, you will find examples of common use cases for automations to help you understand how to use them in your processes. If you want to gain deeper knowledge about mapping processes and BPMN patterns, we have an amazing article written by our CEO Amit Kothari that you can read [here](https://tallyfy.com/bpmn-examples-and-patterns).
