## Automation examples

Each example below covers a tested Tallyfy automation pattern with setup instructions. Pick one, follow the steps, and you're done.

### Assignment

**[Assign to process requestor](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/examples/assign-step-to-requestor/)**
Routes tasks back to whoever launched the process. No manual tracking.

**[Dynamic member assignment from kick-off forms](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/examples/dynamic-member-assignment-from-kickoff/)**
The process launcher picks team members via dropdown fields. Useful when different projects need different people.

**[Service level-based task assignment](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/examples/service-level-assignment/)**
Routes tasks by customer tier (Basic, Premium, Enterprise) so higher-tier customers automatically get the right support teams.

### Workflow control

**[Exclusive choice (pick one path)](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/examples/exclusive-choice/)**
The process follows one branch - never both. Office staff get IT setup; field workers get equipment training. Same template, different paths.

**[Synchronization (wait for multiple approvals)](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/examples/synchronization/)**
Every required sign-off must complete before the next step unlocks.

**[Multi-level approval loops](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/examples/multi-level-approval-loops/)**
A rejection sends the request back for fixes, then the approval chain restarts automatically.

### Time-based

**[Countdown deadline automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/examples/countdown-deadline-automation/)**
Counts backwards from a target date - agendas go out Monday, room bookings due Friday.

**[Combined visibility and deadline rules](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/examples/combined-visibility-deadline-rules/)**
Shows international shipping tasks only when needed AND sets their deadlines from arrival dates. Two automations working together.
