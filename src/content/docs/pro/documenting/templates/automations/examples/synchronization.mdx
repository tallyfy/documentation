## Automation example - synchronization (wait for multiple things)

Use the **AND** operator in Tallyfy [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) to make your process wait for several approvals before moving forward. When you connect conditions with **AND**, *all* of them must be true before anything happens.

*(This diagram shows waiting for both A AND B to finish before moving on)*

Think of it like needing two keys to open a vault - you can't proceed with just one.

### Example - wait for HR and manager approval

Say you're setting up an Employee Onboarding [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), and new hires can't start until both HR and their direct manager approve. Create two [**Approve/Reject** tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-types-of-tasks-can-i-create-with-tallyfy/#approvereject) - one assigned to HR, another to the manager.

Then create a single [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) rule that checks if *both* tasks show "Approved" status:

- **Rule:**
  ```
  IF (HR Approval task) is "Approved"
  AND (Manager Approval task) is "Approved"
  THEN SHOW steps [List of next onboarding steps]
  ```

The **AND** between conditions is your synchronization point. Onboarding steps stay hidden until both approvals come through. No more chasing people or wondering who approved what.
