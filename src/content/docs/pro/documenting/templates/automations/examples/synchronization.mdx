## Automation Example: Synchronization (Wait for Multiple Things)

Ever needed your process to wait for several approvals before moving forward? That's synchronization - and Tallyfy makes it simple.

*(This diagram shows waiting for both A AND B to finish before moving on)*

Here's the secret: use the **AND** operator in Tallyfy [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/). When you connect conditions with **AND**, *all* of them must be true before anything happens. It's like needing two keys to open a vault - you can't proceed with just one.

### Example: Wait for HR and Manager Approval

Let's make this real. You're setting up an Employee Onboarding [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), and new hires can't start until both HR and their direct manager give the thumbs up. Sound familiar?

First, create two [**Approve/Reject** tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-types-of-tasks-can-i-create-with-tallyfy/#approvereject) - one assigned to HR, another to the manager. Simple.

Now here's where it gets interesting. Create a single [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) rule that checks if *both* tasks show "Approved" status:

- **Rule:**
  ```
  IF (HR Approval task) is "Approved"
  AND (Manager Approval task) is "Approved"
  THEN SHOW steps [List of next onboarding steps]
  ```

See that **AND** between the conditions? That's your synchronization point. The onboarding steps stay hidden until both approvals come through. No more chasing people or wondering who approved what.

### Summary

Want processes that wait for multiple green lights? The **AND** operator is your answer. It ensures nothing moves forward until every required condition is met.
