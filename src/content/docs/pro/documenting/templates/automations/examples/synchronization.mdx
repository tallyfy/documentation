## Synchronization pattern. Only proceed when all conditions are met

Synchronization is a pattern that allows you to wait for multiple conditions to be met before proceeding with the [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). This is a common pattern in business processes where you need to wait for multiple events to occur before moving forward.

When can achieve this using Tallyfy's [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) by using the [**AND operator**](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/logic-explained/#and--or-operators). The **AND operator** requires all conditions to be met for the action to take place.

### Example

Let's consider a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) of a New employee onboarding where we need to wait for the approval of the HR department AND the manager before proceeding with the rest of the process.

We will start by defining the steps that require approval using [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) of type [**Approve/reject**](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-types-of-tasks-can-i-create-with-tallyfy/#approvereject)

Once we have the steps defined, we will create one [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) that will wait for both approvals to be completed before proceeding with the process.

- **Automation**: If the HR department approves the request AND the manager approves the request, then proceed with the [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).

Note that the key element here is the use of the **AND operator** in the [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/), which will require both conditions to be met before proceeding with the process.

### Summary

Synchronization is a pattern that allows you to wait for multiple conditions to be met before proceeding with the process, enabling you to ensure that all necessary events have occurred before moving forward.
