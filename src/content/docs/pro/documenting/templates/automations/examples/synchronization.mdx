## Automation Example: Synchronization (Wait for Multiple Things)

Sometimes, you need a process to pause and wait until *multiple* things have happened before it can continue. This is called "synchronization".

*(This diagram shows waiting for both A AND B to finish before moving on)*

You can achieve this in Tallyfy [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) by using the **AND** operator when setting up your conditions. Using **AND** means *all* the conditions you list must be true before the action happens.

### Example: Wait for HR and Manager Approval

Let's use the Employee Onboarding [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) again. Imagine you need approval from *both* the HR department and the new employee's direct manager before the next set of onboarding steps can begin.

First, you would create two separate [**Approve/Reject** type tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-types-of-tasks-can-i-create-with-tallyfy/#approvereject), one assigned to HR and one assigned to the Manager.

Then, you would create **one** [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) rule that checks if *both* of these approval tasks are completed with an "Approved" status.

- **Rule:**
  ```
  IF (HR Approval task) is "Approved"
  AND (Manager Approval task) is "Approved"
  THEN SHOW steps [List of next onboarding steps]
  ```

The key here is using **AND** between the conditions. The next steps will only appear after *both* HR and the Manager have approved.

### Summary

Using the **AND** operator in your automation conditions allows you to make a process wait until multiple conditions are met before it moves forward.
