  such as requiring both HR and manager approval in employee onboarding workflows.

## Automation Example: Synchronization (Wait for Multiple Things)

Sometimes you need a process to wait until *multiple* things happen before continuing. This is called "synchronization".

*(This diagram shows waiting for both A AND B to finish before moving on)*

In Tallyfy [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/), use the **AND** operator for this. **AND** means *all* conditions must be true before the action happens.

### Example: Wait for HR and Manager Approval

Consider an Employee Onboarding [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) where you need approval from *both* HR and the direct manager before continuing.

Create two separate [**Approve/Reject** tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-types-of-tasks-can-i-create-with-tallyfy/#approvereject) - one for HR, one for the Manager.

Then create **one** [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) rule checking if *both* approval tasks show "Approved" status.

- **Rule:**
  ```
  IF (HR Approval task) is "Approved"
  AND (Manager Approval task) is "Approved"
  THEN SHOW steps [List of next onboarding steps]
  ```

The key here is using **AND** between the conditions. The next steps will only appear after *both* HR and the Manager have approved.

### Summary

The **AND** operator makes processes wait until multiple conditions are met before moving forward.
