import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

You can combine visibility rules with deadline rules in Tallyfy to make workflows that adapt to different situations. Here's the magic: steps appear only when you need them AND they automatically get the right deadlines based on what's happening.

## What is the use case for this automation?

Think about processes that change based on circumstances. You need this combination when:

- **Shipping processes**: International shipments need customs checks - but domestic ones don't. When that customs step appears, it needs a deadline tied to the arrival date.
- **Contract renewals**: A custom enterprise contract needs legal review 30 days before expiration. Standard contracts? They skip it entirely.
- **Event planning**: Ordered catering? The catering arrangement task shows up with a 2-week deadline before your event.
- **Customer onboarding**: Premium customers get expedited setup steps with 24-hour turnarounds instead of the standard 5-day timeline.

See the pattern? Steps appear only when relevant, and when they do appear, they come with smart deadlines.

## How do I combine visibility and deadline automations?

<Steps>
1. **Create the conditional step**
   
   Add a step to your [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) that should only appear in certain situations. For example:
   - "Check international shipment arrival"
   - "Premium customer setup"
   - "Regulatory compliance review"

2. **Set up the visibility rule first**
   
   Create an automation to show the step only when needed:
   ```
   IF (Shipment Type field) is "International"
   THEN Show task "Check international shipment arrival"
   ```

3. **Add the deadline rule for the same step**
   
   Create another automation to set the appropriate deadline:
   ```
   IF (Shipment Type field) is "International"
   THEN Set deadline for "Check international shipment arrival" 
        to 7 days after (Expected Arrival Date field)
   ```

4. **Test the combined behavior**
   
   When launching a process:
   - If shipment is domestic: The task stays hidden
   - If shipment is international: The task appears with a deadline 7 days after the expected arrival date
</Steps>

## Real-world examples

### Example 1: Contract renewal with type-specific deadlines

Not all contracts are created equal. Custom enterprise deals need extra attention:

**Step**: "Legal review for special terms"

**Visibility rule**:
```
IF (Contract Type field) is "Custom Enterprise"
THEN Show "Legal review for special terms"
```

**Deadline rule**:
```
IF (Contract Type field) is "Custom Enterprise"
THEN Set deadline to 30 days before (Contract End Date field)
```

What happens? Custom enterprise contracts trigger a legal review 30 days before they expire. Standard contracts breeze right past this step. Simple.

### Example 2: Event planning with optional services

Running an event? Only show tasks for services people actually want:

**Step**: "Arrange catering service"

**Visibility rule**:
```
IF (Services Requested field) contains "Catering"
THEN Show "Arrange catering service"
```

**Deadline rule**:
```
IF (Services Requested field) contains "Catering"
THEN Set deadline to 14 days before (Event Date field)
```

No catering requested? No task appears. Catering needed? The task shows up with a 14-day countdown to event day. Your team focuses only on what matters.

### Example 3: Customer support escalation

When a critical issue hits and first-line support can't fix it, you need rapid escalation:

**Step**: "Senior engineer review"

**Visibility rule**:
```
IF (Issue Priority field) is "Critical"
AND (Initial Resolution) is "Unsuccessful"
THEN Show "Senior engineer review"
```

**Deadline rule**:
```
IF (Issue Priority field) is "Critical"
THEN Set deadline to 2 hours after (Escalation Time field)
```

Here's what happens: Regular issues follow normal flow. But a critical issue that stumps support? It instantly escalates to senior engineers with a 2-hour SLA[^1]. That's how you keep customers happy.

## Advanced patterns

### Multiple conditions affecting the same step

Want to get fancy? Layer multiple rules to handle complex scenarios:

```
// Visibility depends on amount AND region
IF (Purchase Amount field) is greater than $10,000
AND (Region field) is "International"
THEN Show "Export compliance check"

// Express shipping? Tight deadline
IF (Shipping Method field) is "Express"
THEN Set deadline for "Export compliance check" to 1 day after process launch

// Standard shipping gets more time
IF (Shipping Method field) is "Standard"
THEN Set deadline for "Export compliance check" to 3 days after process launch
```

### Cascading deadline adjustments

Sometimes one deadline depends on another. Here's how you chain them together:

```
// First conditional step
IF (Requires Inspection field) is "Yes"
THEN Show "Quality inspection"
AND Set deadline to (Ship Date field) minus 3 days

// Second step depends on first
IF (Requires Inspection field) is "Yes"
THEN Show "Inspection report filing"
AND Set deadline to 1 day after "Quality inspection" deadline
```

## Best practices

After helping hundreds of companies set up these automations, here's what works:

- **Keep conditions aligned**: Match your visibility and deadline triggers. If a step shows for "International" shipments, its deadline should trigger on the same condition.
- **Plan for surprises**: Give hidden steps reasonable default deadlines. You never know when someone might manually show a step.
- **Document everything**: Your future self (and your team) will thank you. Explain why steps appear and how deadlines work.
- **Test the weird stuff**: What happens if someone leaves a date field empty? Or changes a condition mid-process? Find out before your users do.
- **Name steps clearly**: "Premium setup verification" beats "Step 3" every time - especially when steps appear conditionally.

:::tip[Rule evaluation order[^2]]
Tallyfy evaluates all applicable rules when conditions change. Visibility rules determine if a step appears, then deadline rules set appropriate due dates. Both types can reference the same form fields and conditions in your automation setup.
