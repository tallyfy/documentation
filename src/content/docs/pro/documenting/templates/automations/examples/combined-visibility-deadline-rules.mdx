import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This Tallyfy example shows how to use multiple automation rules together - specifically combining visibility rules with deadline rules to create smart, context-aware workflows. Steps only appear when relevant AND have appropriate deadlines based on the specific situation.

## What is the use case for this automation?

Combining visibility and deadline rules is powerful for:

- **Shipping processes**: International shipments need customs checks with deadlines based on arrival dates
- **Contract renewals**: Different contract types have different review requirements and timelines
- **Event planning**: Optional services need completion by specific dates relative to the event
- **Customer onboarding**: Premium customers see expedited steps with tighter deadlines

The key is that steps are both conditionally shown AND have deadlines that adapt to the context.

## How do I combine visibility and deadline automations?

<Steps>
1. **Create the conditional step**
   
   Add a step to your [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) that should only appear in certain situations. For example:
   - "Check international shipment arrival"
   - "Premium customer setup"
   - "Regulatory compliance review"

2. **Set up the visibility rule first**
   
   Create an automation to show the step only when needed:
   ```
   IF (Shipment Type field) is "International"
   THEN Show task "Check international shipment arrival"
   ```

3. **Add the deadline rule for the same step**
   
   Create another automation to set the appropriate deadline:
   ```
   IF (Shipment Type field) is "International"
   THEN Set deadline for "Check international shipment arrival" 
        to 7 days after (Expected Arrival Date field)
   ```

4. **Test the combined behavior**
   
   When launching a process:
   - If shipment is domestic: The task stays hidden
   - If shipment is international: The task appears with a deadline 7 days after the expected arrival date
</Steps>

## Real-world examples

### Example 1: Contract renewal with type-specific deadlines

Different contract types need different review times:

**Step**: "Legal review for special terms"

**Visibility rule**:
```
IF (Contract Type field) is "Custom Enterprise"
THEN Show "Legal review for special terms"
```

**Deadline rule**:
```
IF (Contract Type field) is "Custom Enterprise"
THEN Set deadline to 30 days before (Contract End Date field)
```

Result: Custom enterprise contracts get a legal review step that appears 30 days before expiration. Standard contracts skip this step entirely.

### Example 2: Event planning with optional services

Events may include optional elements with specific timing requirements:

**Step**: "Arrange catering service"

**Visibility rule**:
```
IF (Services Requested field) contains "Catering"
THEN Show "Arrange catering service"
```

**Deadline rule**:
```
IF (Services Requested field) contains "Catering"
THEN Set deadline to 14 days before (Event Date field)
```

Result: The catering task only appears if catering was requested, with a deadline 2 weeks before the event.

### Example 3: Customer support escalation

High-priority issues need faster response times:

**Step**: "Senior engineer review"

**Visibility rule**:
```
IF (Issue Priority field) is "Critical"
AND (Initial Resolution) is "Unsuccessful"
THEN Show "Senior engineer review"
```

**Deadline rule**:
```
IF (Issue Priority field) is "Critical"
THEN Set deadline to 2 hours after (Escalation Time field)
```

Result: Critical issues that couldn't be resolved initially get escalated with a tight 2-hour deadline.

## Advanced patterns

### Multiple conditions affecting the same step

You can layer multiple rules for sophisticated logic:

```
// Visibility depends on amount AND region
IF (Purchase Amount field) is greater than $10,000
AND (Region field) is "International"
THEN Show "Export compliance check"

// Deadline depends on shipping method
IF (Shipping Method field) is "Express"
THEN Set deadline for "Export compliance check" to 1 day after process launch

// Different deadline for standard shipping
IF (Shipping Method field) is "Standard"
THEN Set deadline for "Export compliance check" to 3 days after process launch
```

### Cascading deadline adjustments

Make deadlines relative to other conditional steps:

```
// First conditional step
IF (Requires Inspection field) is "Yes"
THEN Show "Quality inspection"
AND Set deadline to (Ship Date field) minus 3 days

// Second step depends on first
IF (Requires Inspection field) is "Yes"
THEN Show "Inspection report filing"
AND Set deadline to 1 day after "Quality inspection" deadline
```

## Best practices

- **Keep conditions aligned**: Use the same condition trigger for both visibility and deadline rules to ensure consistency
- **Consider hidden step defaults**: Set reasonable default deadlines even for hidden steps in case they're shown
- **Document the logic**: Add clear descriptions explaining when steps appear and why deadlines are set
- **Test edge cases**: Verify behavior when date fields are empty or conditions change
- **Use meaningful step names**: Since steps appear conditionally, names should clearly indicate their purpose

:::tip[Rule evaluation order]
Tallyfy evaluates all applicable rules when conditions change. Visibility rules determine if a step appears, then deadline rules set appropriate due dates. Both types can reference the same form fields and conditions in your automation setup.
