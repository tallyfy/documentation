import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Combine visibility and deadline automations in Tallyfy so steps only appear when relevant - and arrive with the right due date already set.

## When you'd use this

- **Shipping** - International orders need customs checks with deadlines tied to arrival dates. Domestic orders skip the step entirely.
- **Contract renewals** - Enterprise contracts trigger legal review 30 days before expiration. Standard contracts skip it.
- **Event planning** - Catering requested? That task appears with a 14-day countdown to event day.
- **Customer onboarding** - Premium customers get expedited setup steps with 24-hour turnarounds.

## How to set it up

<Steps>
1. **Add a conditional step**

   In your [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), add a step that should only appear in certain situations - for example, "Check international shipment arrival."

2. **Create the visibility rule**

   Add an automation to show the step only when needed:
   ```
   IF (Shipment Type field) is "International"
   THEN Show task "Check international shipment arrival"
   ```
   Tallyfy automatically hides steps with "Show" actions until conditions are met.

3. **Add a deadline rule for the same step**

   Create another automation targeting the same step:
   ```
   IF (Shipment Type field) is "International"
   THEN Set deadline for "Check international shipment arrival"
        to 7 days after (Expected Arrival Date field)
   ```

4. **Test it**

   Launch a process and check:
   - Domestic shipment - the task stays hidden
   - International shipment - the task appears with a deadline 7 days after the expected arrival date
</Steps>

## Examples

### Contract renewal with type-specific deadlines

**Step**: "Legal review for special terms"

**Visibility rule**:
```
IF (Contract Type field) is "Custom Enterprise"
THEN Show "Legal review for special terms"
```

**Deadline rule**:
```
IF (Contract Type field) is "Custom Enterprise"
THEN Set deadline to 30 days before (Contract End Date field)
```

Enterprise contracts trigger legal review 30 days before expiration. Standard contracts skip the step entirely.

### Event planning with optional services

**Step**: "Arrange catering service"

**Visibility rule**:
```
IF (Services Requested field) contains "Catering"
THEN Show "Arrange catering service"
```

**Deadline rule**:
```
IF (Services Requested field) contains "Catering"
THEN Set deadline to 14 days before (Event Date field)
```

No catering requested? No task. Catering needed? The task appears with a 14-day countdown.

### Support escalation

**Step**: "Senior engineer review"

**Visibility rule**:
```
IF (Issue Priority field) is "Critical"
AND (Initial Resolution) is "Unsuccessful"
THEN Show "Senior engineer review"
```

**Deadline rule**:
```
IF (Issue Priority field) is "Critical"
THEN Set deadline to 2 hours after (Escalation Time field)
```

Critical issues that first-line support can't resolve escalate to senior engineers with a 2-hour SLA[^1].

## Advanced patterns

### Multiple conditions on one step

You can use AND/OR logic to combine conditions. Tallyfy supports both operators:

```
// Visibility depends on amount AND region
IF (Purchase Amount field) is greater than $10,000
AND (Region field) is "International"
THEN Show "Export compliance check"

// Express shipping - tight deadline
IF (Shipping Method field) is "Express"
THEN Set deadline for "Export compliance check" to 1 day after process launch

// Standard shipping - more time
IF (Shipping Method field) is "Standard"
THEN Set deadline for "Export compliance check" to 3 days after process launch
```

### Cascading deadlines

One task's deadline can reference another task's deadline:

```
// First conditional step
IF (Requires Inspection field) is "Yes"
THEN Show "Quality inspection"
AND Set deadline to (Ship Date field) minus 3 days

// Second step references first step's deadline
IF (Requires Inspection field) is "Yes"
THEN Show "Inspection report filing"
AND Set deadline to 1 day after "Quality inspection" deadline
```

## Best practices

- **Match your conditions** - If a step shows for "International" shipments, its deadline should trigger on the same condition.
- **Set default deadlines** - Hidden steps should still have reasonable defaults in case someone manually shows a step.
- **Test edge cases** - What happens if a date field is empty? Or a condition changes mid-process? Find out before your users do.
- **Name steps clearly** - "Premium setup verification" beats "Step 3," especially for conditional steps.

:::tip[Rule evaluation order[^2]]
Tallyfy evaluates all applicable rules when conditions change. At process launch, steps with "Show" actions are hidden by default, then rules run to determine which should appear. Deadline rules can reference the same form fields as visibility rules.

import { CardGrid, LinkTitleCard } from "~/components";


[^1]: Service Level Agreement - a contractual commitment to respond within specified time
[^2]: Rules execute in position order. At process launch, steps with "Show" actions are hidden first, then all rule conditions are evaluated.
