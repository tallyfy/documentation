import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Multi-level approval loops reopen earlier steps automatically when someone rejects. Rejections bounce work back for corrections - no manual tracking needed.

## When to use this

Any workflow needing sequential sign-offs:

- **Financial approvals** - Purchase requests through manager, finance, then executive
- **Content publishing** - Draft, editor review, legal review, final sign-off
- **Contract management** - Department head, legal, CFO, CEO
- **Quality control** - Inspection, supervisor check, quality manager sign-off

Rejection at any level bounces work back to whoever needs to fix it.

## Creating the workflow

Here's how the approval chain flows:

```d2
# Multi-Level Approval Workflow
direction: down

# Start
Create: Create Request {
  shape: circle
  style.fill: "#e1f7e6"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

# Approval Steps
Manager: Manager Approval {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#f2faf4"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

Finance: Finance Approval {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#f2faf4"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

COO: COO Approval {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#f2faf4"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

# End
Complete: Complete {
  shape: circle
  style.fill: "#e1f7e6"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.stroke-width: 2
}

# Main Flow
Create -> Manager: Submit for approval {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

# Manager decisions
Manager -> Finance: Approved {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.stroke-width: 2
}
Manager -> Create: Rejected {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.stroke-dash: 3
}

# Finance decisions
Finance -> COO: Approved {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.stroke-width: 2
}
Finance -> Create: Rejected {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.stroke-dash: 3
}

# COO decisions
COO -> Complete: Approved {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.stroke-width: 2
}
COO -> Create: Rejected {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.stroke-dash: 3
}
```

**Key points:**
- Every rejection re-opens the creation task
- Later approvals only appear after earlier ones pass - [visibility rules](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/actions/visibility-actions/)[^1] control this
- COO rejection can re-open multiple steps at once

<Steps>
1. **Set up your approval chain steps**

   In your [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), create steps using the **Approve/Reject** step type:
   - Step 1: "Create wire transfer request" (regular task)
   - Step 2: "Manager review" (Approve/Reject)
   - Step 3: "Finance department approval" (Approve/Reject)
   - Step 4: "COO final approval" (Approve/Reject)

2. **Create re-open rules for each approval level**

   For each approval step, create a [status action[^2]](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/actions/status-actions/) rule that fires on rejection:
   
   **Rule 1: Manager rejection reopens creation**
   ```
   IF (Manager review) is Rejected
   THEN Re-open task "Create wire transfer request"
   ```
   
   **Rule 2: Finance rejection reopens creation**
   ```
   IF (Finance department approval) is Rejected
   THEN Re-open task "Create wire transfer request"
   ```
   
   **Rule 3: COO rejection can reopen multiple steps**
   ```
   IF (COO final approval) is Rejected
   THEN Re-open task "Create wire transfer request"
   AND Re-open task "Manager review"
   ```

3. **Add visibility rules to control flow**

   Hide later approvals until earlier ones pass:
   ```
   IF (Manager review) is Approved
   THEN Show "Finance department approval"
   ```
   ```
   IF (Finance department approval) is Approved
   THEN Show "COO final approval"
   ```
</Steps>

## Advanced approval patterns

### Conditional approval routing

Route approvals based on field values like amount thresholds:

```
IF (Purchase Amount) is greater than $50,000
AND (Manager review) is Approved
THEN Show "Board approval required"
```

### Parallel approvals

When multiple teams need to review at the same time, use parallel approvals:

```d2
# Parallel Approval Workflow
direction: down

# Start
Initial: Initial Review {
  shape: circle
  style.fill: "#e1f7e6"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

# Parallel Approval Steps
Legal: Legal Approval {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#f2faf4"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

Compliance: Compliance Approval {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#f2faf4"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

Finance: Finance Approval {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#f2faf4"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

# Synchronization
Sync: Sync Point {
  shape: diamond
  style.fill: "#f2faf4"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

# End
Final: Final Implementation {
  shape: circle
  style.fill: "#e1f7e6"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.stroke-width: 2
}

# Parallel triggers
Initial -> Legal: Review request {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}
Initial -> Compliance: Review request {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}
Initial -> Finance: Review request {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

# All approvals converge
Legal -> Sync: Approved {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.stroke-width: 2
}
Compliance -> Sync: Approved {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.stroke-width: 2
}
Finance -> Sync: Approved {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.stroke-width: 2
}

# Continue or restart
Sync -> Final: All approved {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.stroke-width: 3
}
Sync -> Initial: Any rejected {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.stroke-dash: 3
}
```

**Key points:**
- All three approvals trigger at once after initial review
- The final step waits until ALL parallel approvals complete
- Any single rejection sends everything back to start

Set this up with [visibility rules](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/actions/visibility-actions/):

```
IF (Initial review) is Completed
THEN Show "Legal approval" 
AND Show "Compliance approval"
AND Show "Finance approval"
```

Then gate the final step on all three approvals:
```
IF (Legal approval) is Approved
AND (Compliance approval) is Approved
AND (Finance approval) is Approved
THEN Show "Final implementation"
```

### Escalation paths

If approvals get stuck:

1. Set a deadline on the approval step
2. Create an escalation step assigned to senior management
3. Use a deadline automation to trigger escalation when time runs out

## Best practices

- **Rejection reasons** - Add comment fields so reviewers explain what needs fixing
- **Notifications** - Turn on email notifications so people know when tasks bounce back
- **Loop limits** - After 3 rejections, escalate to a meeting instead
- **Step instructions** - Tell reviewers the exact criteria you're looking for
- **Audit trail** - Tallyfy tracks every approval and rejection automatically

:::note[Re-open behavior]
When Tallyfy re-opens a task:
- Status changes from "Completed" back to "In progress"
- Original assignees get notified
- All previously entered data stays intact
- The task reappears in each assignee's task list
:::

## Example: Property listing approval

Here's how a real estate agency handles listing approvals:

```d2
Compliance: "Compliance"
Marketing: "Marketing"
Publish: "Publish"
Agent: "Create Listing"
Manager: "Manager Review"
Agent -> Manager
Manager -> Marketing: "✅"
Manager -> Agent: "❌"
Marketing -> Compliance: "✅"
Marketing -> Agent: "❌"
Compliance -> Publish: "✅"
Compliance -> Agent: "❌"
```

**How it works:**
- Marketing rejection gives the agent specific feedback on photos
- Compliance issues notify both agent and manager
- Agents know exactly what to fix. No vague "please see me" sticky notes
