import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

This example shows how to build approval workflows with multiple levels where rejections automatically reopen previous steps for corrections. This ensures quality control while maintaining process flow efficiency.

## What is the use case for this automation?

Multi-level approval loops are essential for:

- **Financial approvals**: Purchase requests that need manager approval, then finance approval, then executive sign-off
- **Content publishing**: Draft → Editor review → Legal review → Final approval
- **Contract management**: Initial draft → Department head → Legal → CFO → CEO
- **Quality control**: Product inspection → Supervisor check → Quality manager sign-off

The key is that rejection at any level sends work back to the appropriate earlier step for correction.

## How do I create a multi-level approval workflow?

<Steps>
1. **Set up your approval chain steps**
   
   Create your [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) with clear approval levels. Use **Approve/Reject** type steps:
   - Step 1: "Create wire transfer request" (Regular task)
   - Step 2: "Manager review" (Approve/Reject)
   - Step 3: "Finance department approval" (Approve/Reject)
   - Step 4: "COO final approval" (Approve/Reject)

2. **Create re-open rules for each approval level**
   
   For each approval step that can reject, create a [status action](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/actions/status-actions/) rule:
   
   **Rule 1: Manager rejection reopens creation**
   ```
   IF (Manager review) is Rejected
   THEN Re-open task "Create wire transfer request"
   ```
   
   **Rule 2: Finance rejection reopens creation**
   ```
   IF (Finance department approval) is Rejected
   THEN Re-open task "Create wire transfer request"
   ```
   
   **Rule 3: COO rejection can reopen multiple steps**
   ```
   IF (COO final approval) is Rejected
   THEN Re-open task "Create wire transfer request"
   AND Re-open task "Manager review"
   ```

3. **Add visibility rules to control flow**
   
   Ensure later approvals only show when earlier ones are approved:
   ```
   IF (Manager review) is Approved
   THEN Show "Finance department approval"
   ```
   ```
   IF (Finance department approval) is Approved
   THEN Show "COO final approval"
   ```
</Steps>

## Advanced approval patterns

### Conditional approval routing

Route to different approvers based on criteria:

```
IF (Purchase Amount) is greater than $50,000
AND (Manager review) is Approved
THEN Show "Board approval required"
```

### Parallel approvals with synchronization

Sometimes multiple approvers need to review simultaneously:

```
IF (Initial review) is Completed
THEN Show "Legal approval" 
AND Show "Compliance approval"
AND Show "Finance approval"
```

Then synchronize before proceeding:
```
IF (Legal approval) is Approved
AND (Compliance approval) is Approved
AND (Finance approval) is Approved
THEN Show "Final implementation"
```

### Escalation paths

Add time-based escalations for stuck approvals:

1. Set the initial approval deadline
2. Create an escalation step assigned to senior management
3. Use deadline automation to trigger escalation

## Best practices for approval loops

- **Clear rejection reasons**: Include comment fields in approval steps so reviewers can explain why they're rejecting
- **Notification setup**: Ensure email notifications are configured so people know when tasks are reopened
- **Loop limits**: Consider adding a counter or limit to prevent infinite rejection loops
- **Documentation**: Include clear instructions in each step about what needs correction
- **Audit trail**: Tallyfy automatically maintains history of approvals and rejections

:::note[Understanding re-open behavior]
When a task is reopened:
- Its status changes from "Completed" back to "Active"
- Original assignees are notified
- Any data entered previously remains intact
- The task appears again in the assignee's active tasks

## Real-world example: Property listing approval

Here's how a real estate agency uses multi-level approvals:

1. **Agent creates listing** - Enters property details and uploads photos
2. **Office manager review** - Checks completeness and accuracy
   - If rejected → Reopens step 1 for agent corrections
3. **Marketing review** - Validates photos and descriptions
   - If rejected → Reopens step 1 for photo/description updates
4. **Compliance check** - Ensures legal requirements are met
   - If rejected → Reopens steps 1 and 2 for corrections
5. **Final publication** - Listing goes live

This ensures every listing meets quality standards while providing clear feedback loops for improvements.
