## Understanding conditionals in automations

Tallyfy [Automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) use conditional logic to automatically handle [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) and decisions. This eliminates manual monitoring and ensures your processes follow the same rules every time.

The **Condition** (the "IF" part) is the foundation of every automation rule. It tells Tallyfy what to check before taking action. Understanding conditions gives you precise control over workflow automation.

Available conditions depend on what you're checking - either a step's status or what someone entered in a form field.

### Step-based conditions

Step-based conditions check workflow progress by looking at step statuses. Options vary by step type:

- **Regular Step**: You can check **Is completed**. (e.g., IF Step 1 Is completed THEN...)
- **Approve/Reject Step**: You can check **Is approved** or **Is rejected**. (e.g., IF Approval Step Is rejected THEN...)
- **Expiry Step**: You can check **Is acknowledged** (completed on time) or **Is expired** (not completed on time).

### Form field conditions

When checking [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) content, available options depend on the field type:

- **Text (Short or Long) or File Upload**: Check if the field **Contains** certain text, **Does not contain** text, **Is empty**, or **Is not empty**.
- **Table**: Check if a specific column **Contains** a certain value.
- **Checklist**: Check which items **Are** checked, **Are not** checked, if the selections **Contain** certain items, **Do not contain** items, or if **Any of** a specific list of items are checked.
- **Dropdown**: Check if the selected option **Is**, **Is not**, **Contains**, **Does not contain**, **Is any of**, **Is greater than**, or **Is less than** a certain value.

These options let your workflows make automatic decisions based on what people enter in forms.

:::note[Combining multiple conditions]
Combine several conditions in one rule using AND/OR logic (explained in [Logic operations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/logic-explained/)). This lets you create very specific triggers for sophisticated automation workflows.
