## Everything about conditionals (IF) in Tallyfy Automations

Tallyfy [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) allow you to automate [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) and decisions based on defined conditions. This guide explains the available conditional options for creating automated workflows, such as sending reminders when tasks are overdue or routing approvals based on specific criteria.

### Conditionals on step types

The options for conditionals vary depending on the step type:

- If the step is of type "Step". You'll get the **Is completed** conditional, meaning you can get something done when a step or a series of steps are completed.

- If the step is of type "Approve/reject". You'll get the **Is rejected** and **Is approved** conditionals. This allows you to get something done if a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) or a series of tasks get approved or rejected.

- If the step is of type "Expiry". You'll get the **Is acknowledged** and **Is expired** conditionals. Allowing you to do something if a step of this type gets completed in time or not.

### Conditionals on field types

Just like with step types, you have access to multiple options for conditionals that vary on the [field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) type:

- Text or File upload: You'll get the **Contains**, **Does not contain**, **Is empty**, and **Is not empty** conditionals. They allow you to dynamically scan your field, and make decisions based on the content of your field.

- Table: You'll get the **Contains** conditional. Which will allow you to scan for a specific value on a specific column you choose.

- Checklist: You'll get the **Is**, **Is not**, **Contains**, **Does not contain**, **Is any of** conditionals. This allows you to automate decisions based on which elements were checked on the list.

- Dropdown: You'll get the **Is**, **Is not**, **Contains**, **Does not contain**, **Is any of**, **Is greater than**, and **Is less than** Conditionals. They will allow you to automate actions in your [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) based on a certain value obtained in the dropdown field

:::note[Adding multiple conditionals]

You can add as many conditionals as you want for an action to take place. This means that you can make multiple combinations of ANDs & ORs to your automation, as well as multiple actions once the conditionals are met.
