## How conditionals work

Conditionals in Tallyfy [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) are "if this, then that" rules. They watch for specific events - a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) getting completed, a form answer matching a value - and trigger actions automatically.

The **Condition** is your "IF" part. What you can check depends on whether you're looking at a step's status or a form field's value.

### Step-based conditions

These check a step's status within your workflow. Every step type also supports **reopened** and **not assigned** conditions.

- **Regular step** (and email step): Is it **completed**? (IF Step 1 Is completed THEN...)
- **Approve/reject step**: Is it **approved** or **rejected**? (IF Approval Step Is rejected THEN send it back)
- **Expiry step**: Is it **acknowledged** or **expired**?

### Form field conditions

You can check what people enter in [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) - both on steps and in kick-off forms - and act on their answers.

Each field type supports different operators:

- **Short text, long text, or file upload**: **Contains**, **Does not contain**, **Is empty**, **Is not empty**. Short text fields with numeric validation also get **Greater than** and **Less than**.
- **Dropdown**: **Is**, **Is not**, **Contains**, **Does not contain**, **Any of**, **Greater than**, **Less than**
- **Radio buttons or checkboxes (multi-select)**: **Is**, **Is not**, **Contains**, **Does not contain**, **Any of**
- **Table**: **Contains** (can target a specific column)
- **Date**: **Contains**, **Does not contain**, **Is empty**, **Is not empty**
- **Assignee form field**: **Is empty**, **Is not empty**

Someone selects "High Priority"? Route it to management. Budget over $10,000? Trigger an approval step automatically.

:::note[Combining multiple conditions]
Combine conditions using AND/OR logic (see [Logic operations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/logic-explained/)) to create precise triggers.
