  on step status and form field values to automatically trigger actions in their workflows.

## Explaining Conditions (the "IF" part) in Tallyfy Automations

[Automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) in Tallyfy let you automate [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) and decisions. The first part of any automation rule is the **Condition** (the "IF" part) – this is what Tallyfy checks to decide if the automation should run.

The exact checks (conditions) you can use depend on what you are checking – either the status of a step or the value entered into a form field.

### Conditions based on Step Type

When your condition checks the status of a step, the options depend on the type of step:

- **Regular Step**: You can check **Is completed**. (e.g., IF Step 1 Is completed THEN...)
- **Approve/Reject Step**: You can check **Is approved** or **Is rejected**. (e.g., IF Approval Step Is rejected THEN...)
- **Expiry Step**: You can check **Is acknowledged** (completed on time) or **Is expired** (not completed on time).

### Conditions based on Field Type

When your condition checks the information inside a [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/), the options depend on the type of field:

- **Text (Short or Long) or File Upload**: Check if the field **Contains** certain text, **Does not contain** text, **Is empty**, or **Is not empty**.
- **Table**: Check if a specific column **Contains** a certain value.
- **Checklist**: Check which items **Are** checked, **Are not** checked, if the selections **Contain** certain items, **Do not contain** items, or if **Any of** a specific list of items are checked.
- **Dropdown**: Check if the selected option **Is**, **Is not**, **Contains**, **Does not contain**, **Is any of**, **Is greater than**, or **Is less than** a certain value.

These options let you check the information entered into forms and make decisions automatically.

:::note[Using multiple conditions]
You can combine several conditions in one automation rule using AND / OR logic (as explained in [Logic operations explained](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/logic-explained/)). This lets you create very specific triggers for your automated actions.
