## How do conditionals work in Tallyfy automations?

Tallyfy [Automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) enable intelligent automation of [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) and decision-making processes through sophisticated conditional logic. This automation framework eliminates manual monitoring and ensures consistent rule-based responses.

The **Condition** (the "IF" component) forms the foundation of every automation rule, representing the specific criteria Tallyfy evaluates to determine whether automated actions should execute. Understanding conditional logic enables precise workflow control and sophisticated process automation.

The exact checks (conditions) you can use depend on what you are checking â€“ either the status of a step or the value entered into a form field.

### How do step-based conditions work?

Step-based conditions evaluate workflow progress by analyzing specific step statuses. Available options vary according to step types, providing precise control over automation triggers:

- **Regular Step**: You can check **Is completed**. (e.g., IF Step 1 Is completed THEN...)
- **Approve/Reject Step**: You can check **Is approved** or **Is rejected**. (e.g., IF Approval Step Is rejected THEN...)
- **Expiry Step**: You can check **Is acknowledged** (completed on time) or **Is expired** (not completed on time).

### How do field type conditions work?

When your condition checks the information inside a [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/), the available options depend on the specific field type:

- **Text (Short or Long) or File Upload**: Check if the field **Contains** certain text, **Does not contain** text, **Is empty**, or **Is not empty**.
- **Table**: Check if a specific column **Contains** a certain value.
- **Checklist**: Check which items **Are** checked, **Are not** checked, if the selections **Contain** certain items, **Do not contain** items, or if **Any of** a specific list of items are checked.
- **Dropdown**: Check if the selected option **Is**, **Is not**, **Contains**, **Does not contain**, **Is any of**, **Is greater than**, or **Is less than** a certain value.

These options enable automatic decision-making based on user-entered form information, creating responsive workflow behavior.

:::note[How can I use multiple conditions together?]
You can combine several conditions in one automation rule using AND / OR logic (as explained in [Logic operations explained](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/logic-explained/)). This capability enables very specific triggers for your automated actions, creating sophisticated conditional workflows.
