description: Tallyfy automations use conditional logic to automatically handle tasks
  and decisions by checking step statuses or form field content with various operators

## Understanding conditionals in automations

Conditionals in Tallyfy [Automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) let you set up "if this happens, then do that" rules - just like you'd explain them to a colleague. No more manually checking if [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) are done or watching for specific form answers.

The **Condition** (that's your "IF" part) tells Tallyfy what to watch for. Think of it as setting up a smart assistant who knows exactly when to take action. Once you understand how conditions work, you can automate almost any decision in your workflow.

Here's the thing - what you can check depends on whether you're looking at a step's progress or what someone typed in a form.

### Step-based conditions

Want to check if someone's finished a task? Or if an approval went through? That's what step-based conditions do - they monitor your workflow's progress.

Different step types give you different options:

- **Regular Step**: Check if it's completed. (IF Step 1 Is completed THEN...)
- **Approve/Reject Step**: Check if it's approved or rejected. (IF Approval Step Is rejected THEN send it back for revision)
- **Expiry Step**: Check if it's acknowledged (done on time) or expired (missed the deadline).

### Form field conditions

Now here's where it gets interesting. You can actually check what people type in [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) - and take different actions based on their answers.

Each field type has its own set of conditions you can check:

- **Text (Short or Long) or File Upload**: Look for specific words (**Contains**), make sure certain words aren't there (**Does not contain**), or check if someone left it blank (**Is empty**/**Is not empty**)
- **Table**: Search for values in specific columns (**Contains**)
- **Checklist**: See which boxes are ticked. You can check if items **Are** checked, **Are not** checked, or if the selection includes specific choices (**Contain**/**Do not contain**). Need to check if any item from a list is selected? Use **Any of**.
- **Dropdown**: This one's powerful - check if the selection **Is** a specific option, **Is not** something, **Contains** certain text, or even compare numeric values (**Is greater than**/**Is less than**)

Simple.

These conditions turn your forms into decision-making tools. Someone selects "High Priority"? Route it to management. Budget over $10,000? Trigger approval workflows automatically.

:::note[Combining multiple conditions]
Combine several conditions in one rule using AND/OR logic (explained in [Logic operations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/logic-explained/)). This lets you create very specific triggers for sophisticated automation workflows.
