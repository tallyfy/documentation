## Conditional logic (the "IF" part) in automations

Conditional logic is the "IF" part of Tallyfy's [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) rules. It lets your [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) automatically make decisions based on specific information or events (the criteria).

:::tip[Simpler than flowcharts]
Drawing complex flowcharts can get confusing quickly. Tallyfy uses simple conditional logic (like "IF X happens...") which is easier for everyone to build, understand, and change, while still handling complex scenarios.
:::

### Why use conditional logic?
- **More efficient processes**: Automate simple decisions.
- **Consistency**: Make sure the same rules are applied every time.
- **Less manual work**: Reduce the need for people to step in for predictable decisions.
- **Adaptive workflows**: Create [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) that change based on the situation.

### Types of conditions you can use
Tallyfy lets you set up conditions based on many things, including:
- Answers given in [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/).
- Whether steps are completed, approved, or rejected.
- The [role](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-do-i-manage-member-permissions-in-tallyfy/) of the user involved.
- Time triggers (like deadlines passing).
- Other process information (metadata).
