## Conditional logic in automations

Conditional logic forms the foundation of Tallyfy's [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) system, enabling your [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) to make automated decisions based on specific criteria. This section explains how to set up and use conditions effectively in your workflows.

:::tip[Simpler than flowcharts]
Traditional flowcharts become unwieldy when handling multiple decision paths and variations. Tallyfy's conditional logic approach handles the same complexity in a more accessible format that allows users to create, understand, and modify logic. This allows for handling infinite variations through straightforward rules rather than complex visual diagrams.

### Benefits of conditional logic
- **Process efficiency** - Automate routine decision points
- **Consistency** - Apply the same logic criteria to every process
- **Reduced manual work** - Eliminate the need for human intervention in predictable scenarios
- **Dynamic workflows** - Create [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) that adapt to different situations

### Types of conditions available
Tallyfy offers various condition types that can be configured based on:
- [Form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) values
- Step statuses
- User [roles](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-do-i-manage-member-permissions-in-tallyfy/)
- Time-based triggers
- Process metadata
