## What's conditional logic?

Conditional logic is the "IF" part of Tallyfy [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) rules - it lets your [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) make decisions automatically. Think of it as teaching your workflow to handle different situations without you.

:::tip[Simpler than flowcharts]
Forget complex flowcharts. Tallyfy's conditional logic works like plain "IF X happens..." statements that anyone on your team can understand and update.

### Why use conditionals?
- **Automate decisions** - your workflow handles routine choices on its own
- **Stay consistent** - the same rules fire every single time, no exceptions
- **Cut manual work** - stop making predictable decisions yourself
- **Adapt on the fly** - [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) respond to what's actually happening

### Available condition types
You can base conditions on:
- [Form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) answers - including kickoff form fields and step form fields (e.g. "if budget exceeds $10,000")
- Step status - completed, reopened, approved, rejected, acknowledged, or expired
- Assignment status - whether a step has no one assigned (`not_assigned`)
