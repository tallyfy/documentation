  or deadlines to create more efficient and adaptive workflows without manual intervention.

## Understanding conditional logic

Conditional logic is the "IF" part of [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) rules. It lets your [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) automatically make decisions based on specific information or events.

:::tip[Simpler than flowcharts]
Drawing complex flowcharts can get confusing quickly. Tallyfy uses simple conditional logic (like "IF X happens...") which is easier for everyone to build, understand, and change, while still handling complex scenarios.

### Benefits of conditional logic
- **Automate decisions**: Handle simple choices automatically.
- **Ensure consistency**: Same rules apply every time.
- **Reduce manual work**: Less need for human intervention on predictable decisions.
- **Create adaptive workflows**: [Processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) that change based on conditions.

### Available condition types
Set up conditions based on various factors:
- Answers given in [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/).
- Whether steps are completed, approved, or rejected.
- The [role](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-do-i-manage-member-permissions-in-tallyfy/) of the user involved.
- Time triggers (like deadlines passing).
- Other process information (metadata).
