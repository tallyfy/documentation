## Conditional logic in automations

Conditional logic forms the foundation of Tallyfy's automation system, enabling your processes to make automated decisions based on specific criteria. This section explains how to set up and use conditions effectively in your workflows.

### Benefits of conditional logic

- **Consistency** - Apply the same logic criteria to every process
- **Reduced manual work** - Eliminate the need for human intervention in predictable scenarios
- **Dynamic workflows** - Create processes that adapt to different situations

### Types of conditions available

- Form field values
