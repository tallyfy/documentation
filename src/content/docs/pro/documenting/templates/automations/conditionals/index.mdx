## Understanding conditional logic

Conditional logic is the "IF" part of Tallyfy [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) rules - it's what lets your [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) make smart decisions automatically. Think of it as teaching your workflow to handle different situations without you.

:::tip[Simpler than flowcharts]
You know those complex flowcharts that make your head spin? Forget them. Tallyfy's conditional logic works like simple "IF X happens..." statements that everyone on your team can actually understand and update. Same power, way less confusion.

### Benefits of conditional logic
- **Automate decisions**: Your workflow handles routine choices on its own
- **Ensure consistency**: The same rules kick in every single time - no exceptions
- **Reduce manual work**: You're not stuck making predictable decisions anymore
- **Create adaptive workflows**: [Processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) that actually respond to what's happening

### Available condition types
Here's what you can base your conditions on:
- Answers from [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) - like "if budget exceeds $10,000"
- Step status - whether something's completed, approved, or rejected
- User [roles](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-do-i-manage-member-permissions-in-tallyfy/) - so managers see different tasks than team members
- Time-based triggers (deadlines approaching or passed)
- Process metadata - any other information about your workflow
