## Conditional logic in automations

Conditional logic forms the foundation of Tallyfy's automation system, enabling your processes to make automated decisions based on specific criteria. This section explains how to set up and use conditions effectively in your workflows.

### Benefits of conditional logic
- **Process efficiency** - Automate routine decision points
- **Consistency** - Apply the same logic criteria to every process
- **Reduced manual work** - Eliminate the need for human intervention in predictable scenarios
- **Dynamic workflows** - Create processes that adapt to different situations

### Types of conditions available
Tallyfy offers various condition types that can be configured based on:
- Form field values
- Step statuses
- User roles
- Time-based triggers
- Process metadata
