## Understanding variables in Tallyfy

Variables are dynamic placeholders that transfer information between different steps in a process, enabling real-time data flow and content customization.

### Purpose of variables

Variables in Tallyfy serve several critical functions:

- **Data transfer** - Pass information from one step to another
- **Dynamic content** - Update content automatically based on user input
- **Personalization** - Customize task descriptions with specific information
- **Process automation** - Use input data to drive conditional logic and automations
- **Consistency** - Ensure the same value appears in multiple locations

### How variables work

1. **Creation** - Variables are created when you add form fields to tasks
2. **Reference** - These variables can be referenced in later steps
3. **Population** - When a user completes a form field, the variable stores that value
4. **Display** - The stored value appears wherever the variable is referenced

### Variable types

Variables can be created from different form field types:

- **Text fields** - Short or long text responses
- **Date fields** - Calendar dates selected by users
- **Number fields** - Numeric values and calculations
- **Selection fields** - Dropdown, radio button, or checkbox selections
- **User fields** - References to specific users or groups

### Common use cases

- Displaying client name throughout a process
- Using project deadlines in multiple task descriptions
- Referencing specific data points in approval steps
- Customizing document templates with project-specific information
- Creating conditional logic based on user selections
