## Understanding variables in Tallyfy

[Variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/) are dynamic placeholders that transfer information between different steps in a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), enabling real-time data flow and content customization.

:::tip[Think of Variables like Mail Carriers or Sticky Notes]
Imagine you collect an important piece of information early in a process, like a customer's **order number** entered into a form.

A **variable** acts like a **mail carrier** who picks up that specific piece of information (the order number) and automatically delivers it to other steps later in the process where it's needed â€“ perhaps to name a task, populate another form, or include it in an email notification.

Alternatively, think of it as writing the order number on a **sticky note** at the beginning of a project. That note (the variable) gets passed along the workflow, so everyone involved later automatically sees the correct order number without having to ask or look it up again.

This automatic transfer saves time and reduces errors by ensuring the right information is available exactly where and when it's needed.

### Purpose of Variables

Variables in Tallyfy serve several critical functions:

- **Data transfer** - Pass information from one step to another
- **Dynamic content** - Update content automatically based on user input
- **Personalization** - Customize [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) descriptions with specific information
- **Process [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/)** - Use input data to drive conditional logic and automations
- **Consistency** - Ensure the same value appears in multiple locations

### How Variables work

1. **Creation** - Variables are created when you add [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to tasks
2. **Reference** - These variables can be referenced in later steps
3. **Population** - When a user completes a form field, the variable stores that value
4. **Display** - The stored value appears wherever the variable is referenced

### Variable types

Variables can be created from different [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) types:

- **Text fields** - Short or long text responses
- **Date fields** - Calendar dates selected by users
- **Number fields** - Numeric values and calculations
- **Selection fields** - Dropdown, radio button, or checkbox selections
- **User fields** - References to specific users or groups

### Common use cases

- Displaying client name throughout a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)
- Using project deadlines in multiple [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) descriptions
- Referencing specific data points in approval steps
- Customizing [document templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) with project-specific information
- Creating conditional logic based on user selections
