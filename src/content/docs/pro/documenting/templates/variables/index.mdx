## What are variables?

[Variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/) in Tallyfy are placeholders that grab information from one step in your [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) and show it wherever else you need it. No more copy-pasting data between steps.

:::tip[Variables = Mail Carriers]
Someone types a **Customer Name** at the start of a process. A variable picks up that name and delivers it to every step that needs it - task titles, descriptions, emails. The name just appears. This cuts out copy-paste errors and saves real time.
:::

### Why use variables?

- **Pass data** - information entered in step 1 automatically appears in steps 5, 8, and 12
- **Live updates** - text updates instantly based on what people type in
- **Personalize** - your [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) instructions show the actual client's name, not just "the client"
- **Trigger automation** - set up [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) rules that react to variable values (if Customer Type = "VIP", route to senior staff)
- **Stay consistent** - that order number stays identical everywhere it appears

### How variables work

1. **Source**: Variables pull data from [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) on your template steps or kick-off form.
2. **Insert**: In the template editor, click the **insert variable** dropdown in the step description toolbar to pick a field. Tallyfy inserts a `{{alias}}`[^1] placeholder.
3. **Collect**: Someone fills in the form field during a running process.
4. **Display**: When the process reaches the later step, Tallyfy swaps the placeholder with the actual value entered.

### Variable sources

Any [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) you add to template steps or the kick-off form becomes a variable source:

- Text and textarea fields
- Date fields
- Dropdown menus, radio buttons, or multi-select checklists
- Email fields
- File upload fields
- Table fields
- Assignee picker fields

Tallyfy also provides built-in system variables like the current task ID and process ID.

### Common uses

- Client name appears in every relevant task title automatically
- A due date from step 2 shows up in steps 10, 15, and 20
- Approval tasks reference exact answers from earlier steps
- [Document templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) fill themselves with process-specific details
- Dropdown selections trigger different workflow paths (pick "Rush Order" and Tallyfy routes it accordingly)
