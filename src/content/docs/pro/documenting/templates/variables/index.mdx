## Understanding variables

[Variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/) are like placeholders that automatically pull information from one step in a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) and display it in another. This helps information flow through your process and allows you to customize content automatically.

:::tip[Variables = Mail Carriers or Sticky Notes]
Think about variables like this:

- **Mail Carrier:** Imagine someone enters important info, like a **Customer Name**, early in a process. A variable acts like a **mail carrier** that picks up that name and automatically delivers it to later steps where it's needed (like in a task title or an email).

- **Sticky Note:** Or, think of writing the Customer Name on a **sticky note** at the start. That note (the variable) travels with the workflow, so everyone later on sees the right name without asking.

This automatic carrying of information saves time and prevents errors.

### Benefits of using variables

Variables help you:

- **Pass data**: Move information collected in one step to later steps.
- **Show live info**: Automatically update text based on what users enter.
- **Personalize**: Make [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) instructions specific to the current situation (e.g., use the client's name).
- **Drive automation**: Use the variable's value in [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) rules (e.g., IF Customer Type variable is "VIP" THEN...).
- **Keep consistent**: Ensure the same value (like an order number) appears correctly in multiple places.

### How variables function

1. **Origin**: Variables come from the data entered into [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) within your tasks.
2. **Insert**: You insert a variable (which looks like `{{fieldName}}`) into the title or description of a *later* step using the **{ }** button.
3. **Fill**: When a user fills in the form field in the earlier step, Tallyfy stores that value.
4. **Display**: When the process gets to the later step, Tallyfy replaces the variable placeholder with the actual stored value.

### Variable sources

Variables are created based on the [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) you add to your template steps, such as:

- Text fields (short or long)
- Date fields
- Number fields
- Dropdown, radio button, or checklist selections
- Fields where users pick other users (Assignee Picker)

### Common variable uses

- Show the client's name in multiple task titles.
- Use a project due date entered early on in later step descriptions.
- Refer back to specific answers given in previous steps during an approval task.
- Customize standard [document templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) with information specific to this process run.
- Use the value selected in a dropdown field to trigger different automation rules.
