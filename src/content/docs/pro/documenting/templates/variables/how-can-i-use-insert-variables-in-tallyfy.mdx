## Using and inserting variables

To use variables in Tallyfy, click the **{ }** button in any step title or description and select data from earlier form fields - that's it. Variables automatically transfer information from one step to another within your [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).

Here's what makes [variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/) powerful: they turn generic workflows into personalized ones. When someone fills out a [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) in step 1, you can display that exact information in steps 5, 10, or 20 - without anyone retyping it. Think of variables as smart placeholders that remember what was entered earlier.

### Requirements for using variables
- A [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) open in edit mode
- At least one [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) in an earlier step (that's your data source)
- A later step where you want to display that data

### How variables work

Variables connect your workflow steps like invisible threads. Simple concept:
- **Source**: The form field where someone types information
- **Target**: Any step title or description where you want that info to appear
- **Format**: Variables appear as `{{fieldName}}` in curly brackets

When someone fills in the source form field, that exact value pops up wherever you've placed the variable. No copying, no pasting - it just appears. Change the source? The variable updates everywhere instantly.

:::tip[Using variables for guest assignment]
**Common use case**: Capture a guest email in the kick-off form, then use `{{guestEmail}}` in later step assignments. This lets you dynamically assign tasks to external people based on who's specified at process launch.

Example: Kick-off form asks "Client email?" → Later step assigns task to `{{clientEmail}}` → That specific client gets the task automatically.

**Important**: Variables populate the assignee field but don't automatically trigger assignment. You must create an automation rule that checks when the kick-off form is complete, then assigns the task to the email captured in the variable.
:::

### Types of variables you can insert

When you click the **{ }** (Insert Variable) button, you'll see three types of data to choose from:

*   **Kick-off form fields**: Info entered when someone first launches the process
*   **Form fields from previous steps**: Any data entered in steps that come *before* where you are now
*   **System variables**: Tallyfy's own tracking info like:
    *   `Current TaskID`: The unique ID for this specific task
    *   `Current ProcessID`: The unique ID for this process run
    *   *(You might see other system IDs too)*

    Most users stick to form fields. System variables? They're mainly for technical integrations[^1] - like when you need to include an ID in a webhook or API call.

### Benefits of using variables

Why use variables? Here's what you gain:

- **Consistency**: That client name entered in step 1? It appears perfectly spelled in steps 3, 7, and 15. No typos.
- **Live Updates**: Change the source data, and watch it update everywhere. Instantly.
- **Personalization**: Instead of "Review proposal," your team sees "Review proposal for Acme Corp" - much clearer
- **Fewer Errors**: Nobody's copying and pasting (and inevitably making mistakes)
- **Context**: Important details stay visible throughout the entire workflow

### Adding variables to step titles

<Steps>
1. Open your [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in Edit mode.
2. ![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-open-edit-mode-template.png)
3. Make sure you have a [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) in an earlier step to get the data you want to display.
4. ![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-show-formfields.png)
5. Go to a step that happens *after* the step with the form field.
6. Click on the step title to edit it.
7. Place your cursor where you want the variable information to appear.
8. Click the **{ }** (Insert Variable) button that appears near the title field.
9. Select the form field (the source) from the list.
10. The variable (like `{{fieldName}}`) will be inserted. Save your changes if needed.
</Steps>

### Adding variables to step descriptions

<Steps>
1. Open your [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in Edit mode.
2. Ensure the source [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) exists in an earlier step.
3. Go to a later step and click into its description box.
4. Place your cursor where you want the variable information to appear.
5. Click the **{ }** (Insert Variable) button in the text editor toolbar.
6. Select the form field (the source) from the list.
7.![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-insert-variables.png)
8. The variable will be inserted. Changes save automatically.
</Steps>

### How variables work during process execution

Here's what happens when your process runs:

1. Someone fills out a [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) in an early step
2. Tallyfy stores that value (don't worry - it's secure)
3. Later steps with variables automatically show the actual values instead of placeholders like `{{fieldName}}`
4. Need to fix a typo? Update the source field and watch the change ripple through

It's that straightforward. No magic, just smart data flow.

### Common variable examples

#### Making task titles specific
- "Get approval for Project: `{{projectName}}`"
- "Review document for Client: `{{clientName}}`"
- "Schedule meeting with `{{departmentName}}` lead"

#### Making instructions specific
- "Please review the proposal for `{{clientName}}`, focusing on the section about `{{focusArea}}`."
- "Call `{{customerName}}` at `{{phoneNumber}}` to discuss their order `{{orderNumber}}`."
- "Prepare the `{{documentType}}` based on the request from `{{requestingDepartment}}`."
- "Upload your documents here: `{{fileRequestLink}}`" (useful for [file request links](mdc:products/pro/integrations/document-management/file-request-links/) from your DMS)

#### Renaming projects with field values
Variables shine when combined with [auto-naming](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/edit-processes/how-can-i-auto-name-a-process-in-tallyfy/). Your processes can name themselves based on the data entered:

- "Onboarding - `{{employeeName}}` - `{{department}}`"
- "Support Ticket - `{{ticketNumber}}` - `{{clientName}}`"
- "Project Setup - `{{projectName}}` - `{{priority}}`"

Result? Every process gets a meaningful name automatically. No more "Process #12345" confusion.

### Tips for effective variable usage

Want variables that actually work? Follow these practices:

- Name your [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) clearly. "Customer Name" beats "Field 1" every time
- Always test-run your template. Trust me on this one.
- Consider empty fields - if someone skips the "Department" field, will "Contact the lead" still make sense?
- Use variables for anything that changes between process runs (names, dates, amounts)
- Surround variables with context: "Contact `{{name}}` at `{{phone}}`" not just "`{{name}}` `{{phone}}`"

### Advanced variable techniques for dynamic content substitution

Ready to level up? Here's where variables get really interesting.

**Creating adaptive instructions**:
One template can handle multiple scenarios. No more maintaining 10 slightly different versions of the same process.

**Example - Purchase requisition that adapts to amount**:
Your kick-off form asks for "Purchase Amount". Then magic happens:
- Step title becomes: "Get approval from `{{approverTitle}}`"
- Automation rules set `{{approverTitle}}` based on the amount:
  - Under $1,000: "Department Manager"
  - $1,000-$10,000: "Division Director"
  - Over $10,000: "CFO"

**Building personalized checklists**:
Watch how variables combine with conditional visibility:

1. Kick-off form asks: "Which region?" (dropdown: North, South, East, West)
2. Instructions say: "Complete the `{{region}}` region compliance checklist"
3. Conditional rules show only that region's requirements
4. One template now does the job of four. Nice.

**Dynamic email notifications**:
Your automated emails can speak directly to each recipient:
- Subject: "Action required: `{{taskName}}` for `{{clientName}}`"
- Body: "The `{{documentType}}` for `{{projectName}}` needs your review by `{{dueDate}}`"

Real emails, real names, real deadlines. Much better than "You have a task waiting."

:::tip[Variables + Conditional Logic = Smart Templates]
The real power comes from combining variables with [conditional automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/conditional-visibility-guide/). This lets you create intelligent templates that adapt based on the data entered, eliminating the need for multiple similar templates.

### Troubleshooting broken variables

**Variables showing as raw text instead of values?** (like seeing `{{clientName}}` instead of "Acme Corp")

This happens when variables lose their connection to the source field. The fix is simple:

1. Delete the broken variable text completely
2. Click the **{ }** (Insert Variable) button again
3. Re-select the field from the dropdown
4. Save your changes

Common causes of broken variables:
- Renaming or deleting the source form field
- Copying template content from another template
- Manual typing of variable syntax instead of using the insert button
- Template import/export operations that disconnect references

**Pro tip**: Always use the **{ }** button to insert variables rather than typing them manually. This ensures proper field linking.

### Variables in URLs - Hidden character issue

:::caution[URLs with variables may contain hidden characters]
When embedding variables in URLs within step descriptions, the editor may insert invisible UTF-8 BOM characters[^2] (%EF%BB%BF) that break the links.

**Problem**: Your URL shows as `https://example.com?id=%EF%BB%BFvalue%EF%BB%BF` instead of `https://example.com?id=value`

**Solution - Compose URLs externally**:
1. Build your complete URL in a plain text editor first
2. Include the variable placeholders: `https://example.com?id={{recordID}}`
3. Copy the entire URL from your text editor
4. Paste it into the step description as a complete unit
5. Test the link in a launched process to verify it works

**Why this happens**: The rich text editor adds invisible formatting characters around inserted variables. Composing the URL externally avoids this issue.
