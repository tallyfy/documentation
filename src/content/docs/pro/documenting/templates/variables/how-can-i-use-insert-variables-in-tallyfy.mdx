## How to use variables in step titles and descriptions

Insert [Variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/) let you automatically show information from one step later on in the same [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). You do this by adding a variable that refers to a [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) from an earlier step into the title or description of a later step.

### What you need
- A [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) open in edit mode.
- At least one [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) in an earlier step (the source of the data).
- A later step where you want to display the data from that form field.

### How Insert Variables work

Variables link data from one place to another:
- **Source**: The form field where someone enters information.
- **Target**: The step title or description where you insert the variable.

When someone fills in the source form field, the value they enter automatically shows up wherever you placed the variable in later steps.

### Types of variables you can insert

When you click the **{ }** (Insert Variable) button in the editor, you can choose data from:

*   **Kick-off form fields**: Information entered when the process was first started.
*   **Form fields from previous steps**: Data entered in any form field in steps that come *before* the current step.
*   **System variables**: Special Tallyfy information like:
    *   `Current TaskID`: The unique ID number for the current task.
    *   `Current ProcessID`: The unique ID number for this specific run of the process.
    *   *(Other system IDs might be available)*

    System variables are mostly useful for technical reasons, like including an ID in a link to another system.

### Why use Insert Variables?
- **Consistency**: Show the same information (like a client name) in multiple places without retyping.
- **Live Updates**: If the data in the source form field changes, the variable updates automatically.
- **Personalization**: Make task titles and instructions specific to this run of the process (e.g., "Review proposal for [Client Name]").
- **Fewer Errors**: Avoid mistakes from manually copying data between steps.
- **Context**: Keep important information visible throughout the workflow.

### Adding Variables to step titles

<Steps>
1. Open your [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in Edit mode.
2. ![Template in edit mode](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-open-edit-mode-template.png)
3. Make sure you have a [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) in an earlier step to get the data you want to display.
4. ![Creating form fields](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-show-formfields.png)
5. Go to a step that happens *after* the step with the form field.
6. Click on the step title to edit it.
7. Place your cursor where you want the variable information to appear.
8. Click the **{ }** (Insert Variable) button that appears near the title field.
9. Select the form field (the source) from the list.
10. The variable (like `{{fieldName}}`) will be inserted. Save your changes if needed.
</Steps>

### Adding Variables to step descriptions

<Steps>
1. Open your [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in Edit mode.
2. Ensure the source [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) exists in an earlier step.
3. Go to a later step and click into its description box.
4. Place your cursor where you want the variable information to appear.
5. Click the **{ }** (Insert Variable) button in the text editor toolbar.
6. Select the form field (the source) from the list.

8. The variable will be inserted. Changes save automatically.
</Steps>

### How Variables work when the process runs

1. Someone fills out the source [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) in an early step.
2. Tallyfy remembers the value entered.
3. When the process reaches a later step containing the variable, Tallyfy automatically replaces the variable placeholder (like `{{fieldName}}`) with the actual value that was entered.
4. If the value in the source form field is changed later, the variable display will also update.

### Common examples

#### Making task titles specific
- "Get approval for Project: `{{projectName}}`"
- "Review document for Client: `{{clientName}}`"
- "Schedule meeting with `{{departmentName}}` lead"

#### Making instructions specific
- "Please review the proposal for `{{clientName}}`, focusing on the section about `{{focusArea}}`."
- "Call `{{customerName}}` at `{{phoneNumber}}` to discuss their order `{{orderNumber}}`."
- "Prepare the `{{documentType}}` based on the request from `{{requestingDepartment}}`."

### Tips for using variables
- Give your [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) clear names so they are easy to find in the variable list.
- Test your template by running the process to make sure variables show the correct information.
- Think about what should happen if the source form field is left empty â€“ will the sentence still make sense?
- Use variables for information that might change from one run of the process to the next.
- Mix variables with regular text to provide clear context.
