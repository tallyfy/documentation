## How to use variables in step titles and descriptions

Insert [Variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/) allow dynamic display of information across your [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) by referencing [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) values from one step in another step\'s title or description.

### Requirements
- A [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in edit mode
- [Form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) in an earlier step
- A subsequent step where you want to display the form field values

### How Insert Variables work

Insert Variables create dynamic references between:
- **Source**: A form field where data is entered
- **Target**: A title or description where that data is displayed

When a user completes a form field in an early step, its value automatically appears in any later steps that reference it using variables.

### Benefits of using Insert Variables
- **Data consistency** - Information entered once is displayed consistently throughout the process
- **Dynamic updates** - Changes to form values update all references automatically
- **Personalization** - [Task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) titles and descriptions adapt to specific process instances
- **Error reduction** - Eliminate manual data copying between steps
- **Context preservation** - Maintain relevant information across the workflow

### Adding variables to step titles

1. Open your [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in Edit mode
   ![Template in edit mode](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-open-edit-mode-template.png)
2. Create [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) in an earlier step that will provide the data

3. Navigate to a later step where you want to use the [variable](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/)
4. Click on the step title field to edit it
5. Position your cursor where you want to insert the variable
6. Click the **{ }** (Insert Variable) button
7. Select the form field you want to reference
8. Save your changes

### Adding variables to step descriptions

1. Open your [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in Edit mode
2. Create [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) in an earlier step
3. Navigate to a later step\'s description editor
4. Position your cursor where you want to insert the [variable](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/)
5. Click the **{ }** button in the text editor toolbar
6. Select the form field you want to reference

7. Save your changes

### Variable behavior during process execution

When the [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) is [launched](/products/pro/launching/):
1. Users complete the [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) in early steps
2. The system captures these values
3. In later steps, the [variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/) are automatically replaced with the actual values
4. If form field values change, all variable references update accordingly

### Common use cases

#### Dynamic task titles
- Approval request for [Project Name]
- Review document for [Client Name]
- Schedule meeting with [Department]

#### Contextual instructions
- "Please review the proposal for [Client Name] focusing on [Focus Area]"
- "Contact [Customer Name] at [Phone Number] to discuss [Topic]"
- "Prepare [Document Type] according to requirements from [Requesting Department]"

### Best practices
- Use descriptive [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) names for easier variable selection
- Test your [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) to ensure variables display as expected
- Consider what happens if a form field is left empty
- Use variables for information that might change during the process
- Combine multiple [variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/) with fixed text for clear context
