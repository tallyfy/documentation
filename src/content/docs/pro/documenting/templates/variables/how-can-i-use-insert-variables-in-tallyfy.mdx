## Using and inserting variables

Click the **{ }** button in any step title or description to insert data from earlier form fields. That's the core of it. Variables automatically pull information from one step into another within your [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).

They turn generic workflows into personalized ones. Someone fills out a [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) in step 1, and you can display that exact value in steps 5, 10, or 20 - no retyping needed.

### Requirements
- A [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) open in edit mode
- At least one [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) in an earlier step (your data source)
- A later step where you want that data to appear

### How variables work

- **Source**: The form field where someone enters information
- **Target**: Any step title or description where you want that info to appear
- **Format**: Variables use `{{field-alias}}` syntax in double curly brackets

When someone fills in the source field, that value appears wherever you've placed the variable. Change the source? It updates everywhere instantly.

:::tip[Using variables for guest assignment]
Capture a guest email in the kick-off form, then use that variable in later step assignments to dynamically assign tasks to external people.

Example: Kick-off form asks "Client email?" - later step assigns task to `{{client-email}}` - that client gets the task automatically.

**Note**: You'll need an automation rule that checks when the kick-off form is complete, then assigns the task to the email captured in the variable.
:::

### Types of variables

When you click **{ }**, you'll see two categories:

*   **Kick-off form fields**: Data entered when someone launches the process
*   **Form fields from previous steps**: Data entered in steps that come *before* the current one

Tallyfy also supports built-in system variables[^1]:
*   `{{current-task-id}}` - the unique ID of the current task
*   `{{current-process-id}}` - the unique ID of the running process
*   `{{DATE}}` - the date the process was launched
*   `{{TEMPLATE_NAME}}` - the name of the template

:::note[Not all field types support variables]
File upload, table, and assignee form fields can't be used as variable sources. Only text, textarea, radio, dropdown, multiselect, and date fields appear in the variable picker.

### Adding variables to step titles

<Steps>
1. Open your [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in Edit mode.
2. ![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-open-edit-mode-template.png)
3. Make sure you have a [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) in an earlier step.
4. ![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-show-formfields.png)
5. Go to a step that comes *after* the step with the form field.
6. Click the step title to edit it.
7. Place your cursor where you want the variable to appear.
8. Click the **{ }** button near the title field.
9. Select the form field from the dropdown.
10. The variable gets inserted. Save your changes.
</Steps>

### Adding variables to step descriptions

<Steps>
1. Open your [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in Edit mode.
2. Confirm the source [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) exists in an earlier step.
3. Go to a later step and click into its description box.
4. Place your cursor where you want the variable.
5. Click the **{ }** button in the text editor toolbar.
6. Select the form field from the dropdown.
7.![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-insert-variables.png)
8. The variable gets inserted. Changes save automatically.
</Steps>

### During process execution

1. Someone fills out a [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) in an early step
2. Tallyfy stores that value
3. Later steps with variables show the actual values instead of `{{field-alias}}` placeholders
4. Update the source field and the change flows through everywhere

### Common examples

#### Task titles with context
- "Get approval for Project: `{{project-name}}`"
- "Review document for Client: `{{client-name}}`"
- "Schedule meeting with `{{department-name}}` lead"

#### Specific instructions
- "Review the proposal for `{{client-name}}`, focusing on `{{focus-area}}`."
- "Call `{{customer-name}}` at `{{phone-number}}` to discuss order `{{order-number}}`."
- "Prepare the `{{document-type}}` based on the request from `{{requesting-department}}`."

#### Auto-naming processes
Variables pair well with [auto-naming](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/edit-processes/how-can-i-auto-name-a-process-in-tallyfy/). Your processes name themselves based on form data:

- "Onboarding - `{{employee-name}}` - `{{department}}`"
- "Support Ticket - `{{ticket-number}}` - `{{client-name}}`"

No more "Process #12345" confusion.

### Tips for good variable usage

- Name your [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) clearly - "Customer Name" beats "Field 1"
- Test-run your template before going live
- Think about empty fields - if someone skips "Department," will "Contact the lead" still make sense?
- Surround variables with context: "Contact `{{name}}` at `{{phone}}`" not just "`{{name}}` `{{phone}}`"

### Combining variables with conditional logic

One template can handle multiple scenarios when you combine variables with [conditional automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/conditional-visibility-guide/).

**Example - Region-specific checklists**:
1. Kick-off form asks: "Which region?" (dropdown: North, South, East, West)
2. Instructions say: "Complete the `{{region}}` region compliance checklist"
3. Conditional rules show only that region's requirements
4. One template does the job of four.

**Dynamic email notifications** can also use variables:
- Subject: "Action required: `{{task-name}}` for `{{client-name}}`"
- Body: "The `{{document-type}}` for `{{project-name}}` needs your review by `{{due-date}}`"

:::tip[Variables + conditional logic = smart templates]
Combining variables with [conditional automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/conditional-visibility-guide/) lets you create templates that adapt based on the data entered - no need for multiple similar templates.
:::

### Troubleshooting broken variables

**Variables showing as raw text?** (like seeing `{{client-name}}` instead of "Acme Corp")

This means the variable lost its connection to the source field. Fix it:

1. Delete the broken variable text
2. Click the **{ }** button again
3. Re-select the field from the dropdown
4. Save your changes

Common causes:
- Renaming or deleting the source form field
- Copying template content from another template
- Manually typing `{{...}}` instead of using the insert button
- Template import/export operations that break references

Always use the **{ }** button rather than typing variable syntax manually.

### Variables in URLs - hidden character issue

:::caution[URLs with variables may contain hidden characters]
The rich text editor may insert invisible UTF-8 BOM characters[^2] (%EF%BB%BF) around variables in URLs, breaking the links.

**Problem**: `https://example.com?id=%EF%BB%BFvalue%EF%BB%BF` instead of `https://example.com?id=value`

**Fix**: Build your complete URL in a plain text editor first (including variable placeholders like `https://example.com?id={{record-id}}`), then paste it into the step description as a single unit. Test the link in a launched process.
