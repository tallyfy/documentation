## How can I convert BPMN patterns into Tallyfy templates?

To convert BPMN diagrams into Tallyfy templates, simply recreate your process logic using Tallyfy's intuitive step-by-step builder - no technical expertise required. You'll build executable workflows that everyone can actually use.

Here's the thing: many organizations have invested heavily in BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagrams. They're standardized, sure. But they're also sitting in folders gathering dust. Tallyfy transforms these complex diagrams into living, breathing workflows that your team will actually follow.

### What challenges do traditional BPMN diagrams present?

Let's be honest - BPMN diagrams can be a nightmare. You've probably experienced at least one of these frustrations:

- **Complex Symbolism**: Those diamonds, circles, and gateways? Your team needs weeks of training just to read them properly
- **Static Documentation**: Beautiful diagrams that just... sit there. They can't actually run anything
- **Technical Barriers**: Ask your accounting team to interpret a BPMN diagram. Watch their eyes glaze over
- **Modification Complexity**: Want to change a single step? Better call IT and block out half your afternoon
- **Implementation Gap**: There's always that awkward moment when you realize the diagram looks nothing like how people actually work

### What are the advantages of using Tallyfy instead of BPMN?

This is where it gets good. Tallyfy takes everything frustrating about BPMN and flips it:

- **Run your processes**: Your templates become actual workflows. Launch them, track them, complete them. Done.
- **No coding needed**: Forget specialized software. If you can fill out a form, you can build a process
- **Easy to use**: Your entire team gets it instantly - from interns to executives
- **Live updates**: Change a step? It's live immediately. No deployment cycles or version control headaches
- **Built-in tracking**: See exactly where every process stands. No more "let me check on that" emails

### How does Tallyfy handle common BPMN patterns?

Remember those complex BPMN patterns you learned in that certification course? Tallyfy handles them all - just without the headache:

| BPMN Pattern (Technical Term) | Tallyfy Implementation (How Tallyfy does it) |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Sequential Flow               | Steps happen one after another (default)     |
| Parallel Split (AND)          | Multiple steps happen at the same time       |
| Exclusive Gateway (XOR)[^1]       | Rules decide which single path to take next |
| Inclusive Gateway (OR)[^2]        | Rules decide which path(s) to take next    |
| Synchronization               | Waiting for multiple steps to finish         |
| Structured Loop               | Repeating steps within a process             |
| Deferred Choice               | Rules decide who gets assigned a task        |

- Real-world examples from actual customers
- Shortcuts that'll save you hours

### What are the general steps for converting BPMN to Tallyfy?

Ready to make the switch? Here's your roadmap:

1. **Study your BPMN diagram** - identify the main steps, decision points, and who's responsible for what (this usually takes 10-15 minutes)
2. **Map the core logic** - what happens in sequence? Where do paths split? Simple.
3. **Create a new template** in Tallyfy
4. **Build your workflow** - add steps, assign them to the right people, and set up your automation rules. It's like building with blocks
5. **Add the details** - drop in your [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/), configure decision rules, and set up [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/)
6. **Test run** - launch a test process and walk through it. You'll spot any issues immediately
7. **Go live** - [Launch](/products/pro/launching/) the real thing and watch your team actually follow the process

The best part? You can do this entire conversion in under an hour for most processes.

[^1]: XOR means eXclusive OR - only one path can be taken, mutually exclusive choices
[^2]: OR allows multiple paths simultaneously, unlike XOR which forces a single choice
