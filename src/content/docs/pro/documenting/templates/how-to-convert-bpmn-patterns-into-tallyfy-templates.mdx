## Transitioning from BPMN to Tallyfy templates

Many organizations have existing business processes documented in Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagrams. Tallyfy provides a more accessible and executable approach to implementing these workflows.

### Understanding BPMN challenges

Traditional BPMN diagrams present several challenges:
- Complex symbols and notation require specialized knowledge
- Static documentation doesn't drive actual execution
- Difficult for non-technical users to understand
- Changes require diagramming skills and software
- Gap between process documentation and implementation

### Advantages of Tallyfy's approach

Tallyfy offers significant improvements over traditional BPMN:
- **Executable processes** - Templates become live, trackable workflows
- **No-code implementation** - No diagramming or technical skills required
- **User-friendly interface** - Intuitive for all stakeholders
- **Real-time updates** - Changes apply immediately across the organization
- **Built-in tracking** - Monitor progress and identify bottlenecks

### Common BPMN patterns in Tallyfy

Tallyfy supports all standard BPMN flow patterns through its template system:

| BPMN Pattern | Tallyfy Implementation |
|--------------|------------------------|
| Sequential Flow | Default step ordering |
| Parallel Split (AND) | Multiple concurrent steps |
| Exclusive Gateway (XOR) | Conditional branching |
| Inclusive Gateway (OR) | Multiple conditional paths |
| Synchronization | Wait steps and dependencies |
| Structured Loop | Repetition within processes |
| Deferred Choice | Dynamic assignment rules |

### Resources for conversion

For comprehensive instructions on mapping specific BPMN patterns to Tallyfy templates, refer to our detailed guide:

This resource includes:
- Step-by-step conversion methods
- Visual examples of each pattern
- Implementation techniques
- Best practices for process simplification
- Comparative analysis of approaches

### Conversion process overview

1. Identify your existing BPMN processes and patterns
2. Determine the core workflow logic (sequence, conditions, assignments)
3. Create a new Tallyfy template
4. Implement each pattern using Tallyfy's step configuration
5. Add form fields, conditions, and automations as needed
6. Test the template to ensure it matches the intended workflow
7. Launch and monitor the process
