title: Convert BPMN patterns into Tallyfy templates
---

## How can I convert BPMN patterns into Tallyfy templates?

Many organizations document business processes using BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagrams, which provide standardized visual representations of workflow logic.

Tallyfy transforms these complex BPMN diagrams into intuitive, executable templates that any team member can understand and use effectively. This conversion in Tallyfy eliminates technical barriers while preserving essential process logic and workflow structure.

### What challenges do traditional BPMN diagrams present?

Traditional BPMN diagrams create several operational challenges that limit their practical effectiveness:

- **Complex Symbolism**: Specialized symbols need extensive training for proper interpretation and understanding
- **Static Documentation**: Diagrams remain visual documentation without executable workflow capabilities
- **Technical Barriers**: Non-technical team members struggle to follow complex diagrammatic representations
- **Modification Complexity**: Changes need specialized software expertise and technical skills
- **Implementation Gap**: Significant disconnects often exist between diagram specifications and actual work execution

### What are the advantages of using Tallyfy instead of BPMN?

Tallyfy makes process management much easier:
- **Run your processes**: Tallyfy templates turn into live workflows you can track
- **No coding needed**: Build processes without needing technical skills or drawing diagrams
- **Easy to use**: Simple interface that makes sense to everyone involved
- **Live updates**: Changes to templates can be used immediately
- **Built-in tracking**: Easily see progress and find delays in Tallyfy

### How does Tallyfy handle common BPMN patterns?

Tallyfy templates can handle all the standard ways processes flow in BPMN diagrams:

| BPMN Pattern (Technical Term) | Tallyfy Implementation (How Tallyfy does it) |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Sequential Flow               | Steps happen one after another (default)     |
| Parallel Split (AND)          | Multiple steps happen at the same time       |
| Exclusive Gateway (XOR)       | Rules decide which single path to take next |
| Inclusive Gateway (OR)        | Rules decide which path(s) to take next    |
| Synchronization               | Waiting for multiple steps to finish         |
| Structured Loop               | Repeating steps within a process             |
| Deferred Choice               | Rules decide who gets assigned a task        |

### What are the general steps for converting BPMN to Tallyfy?

1. Look at your BPMN diagram and understand the main steps, decisions, and who does what
2. Figure out the core logic: what needs to happen in order? When do decisions need to be made?
3. Create a new Tallyfy template
4. Build the workflow in Tallyfy using steps, assignments, and rules to match the logic from the BPMN diagram
5. Add necessary [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/), decision rules (conditions), and other [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/)
6. Test the Tallyfy template by running it to ensure it works as expected
7. [Launch](/products/pro/launching/) the process for real use
