## How to map BPMN patterns to Tallyfy templates

Many organizations have existing business processes documented in Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagrams. Tallyfy provides a more accessible and executable approach to implementing these workflows.

### Understanding BPMN challenges

Traditional BPMN diagrams present several challenges:
- Complex symbols and notation require specialized knowledge
- Static documentation doesn't drive actual execution
- Difficult for non-technical users to understand
- Changes require diagramming skills and software
- Gap between process documentation and implementation

### Advantages of Tallyfy's approach

Tallyfy offers improvements over traditional BPMN:
- **Executable [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)** - Templates become live, trackable workflows
- **No-code implementation** - No diagramming or technical skills required
- **User-friendly interface** - Intuitive for all stakeholders
- **Real-time updates** - Changes apply immediately across the organization
- **Built-in tracking** - Monitor progress and identify bottlenecks

### Common BPMN patterns in Tallyfy

Tallyfy supports all standard BPMN flow patterns through its [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) system:

| BPMN Pattern | Tallyfy Implementation |
|--------------|------------------------|
| Sequential Flow | Default [step](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) ordering |
| Parallel Split (AND) | Multiple concurrent steps |
| Exclusive Gateway (XOR) | Conditional branching |
| Inclusive Gateway (OR) | Multiple conditional paths |
| Synchronization | Wait steps and dependencies |
| Structured Loop | Repetition within [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) |
| Deferred Choice | Dynamic assignment rules |

### Resources for conversion

For comprehensive instructions on mapping specific BPMN patterns to Tallyfy templates, refer to our detailed guide:

[BPMN Examples and Patterns](https://tallyfy.com/bpmn-examples-and-patterns)

This resource includes:
- Step-by-step conversion methods
- Visual examples of each pattern
- Implementation techniques
- Best practices for process simplification
- Comparative analysis of approaches

### Conversion process overview

1. Identify your existing BPMN processes and patterns
2. Determine the core workflow logic (sequence, conditions, assignments)
3. Create a new Tallyfy template
4. Implement each pattern using Tallyfy's step configuration
5. Add [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/), conditions, and [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) as needed
6. Test the template to ensure it matches the intended workflow
7. [Launch](/products/pro/launching/) and monitor the process
