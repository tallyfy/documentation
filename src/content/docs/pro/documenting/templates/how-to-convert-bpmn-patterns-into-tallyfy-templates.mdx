## Converting BPMN patterns into Tallyfy templates

Tallyfy provides a streamlined alternative to traditional Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) diagrams. Rather than managing complex flowcharts across multiple files, you can implement the same process patterns in a more accessible format.

## BPMN pattern conversion guide

For detailed instructions on converting BPMN patterns to Tallyfy templates, refer to our comprehensive guide: [BPMN Examples and Patterns](https://tallyfy.com/bpmn-examples-and-patterns).

This resource covers conversion methods for common BPMN patterns including:
* Sequence flows
* Parallel splits
* Synchronization
* Exclusive choice
* Multiple choice
* Merge patterns
* Loops and iterations

The guide also includes a comparative analysis of BPMN and Tallyfy approaches to process management, highlighting the advantages of Tallyfy's simplified implementation.
