## How to map BPMN diagrams to Tallyfy templates

Some companies document their processes using complex diagrams called BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation). Tallyfy offers a simpler way to build and run these workflows that everyone can understand and use.

### Challenges with traditional BPMN diagrams

Using BPMN diagrams can be difficult because:
- They use special symbols that require training to understand.
- They are just pictures; they don't actually run the process.
- They can be hard for people who aren't technical experts to follow.
- Making changes requires special software and skills.
- There's often a gap between the diagram and how the work actually gets done.

### Advantages of using Tallyfy instead

Tallyfy makes process management easier:
- **Run your processes**: Templates turn into live workflows you can track.
- **No coding needed**: Build processes without needing technical skills or drawing diagrams.
- **Easy to use**: Simple interface that makes sense to everyone involved.
- **Live updates**: Changes to templates can be used immediately.
- **Built-in tracking**: Easily see progress and find delays.

### Common BPMN patterns in Tallyfy

Tallyfy templates can handle all the standard ways processes flow in BPMN diagrams:

| BPMN Pattern (Technical Term) | Tallyfy Implementation (How Tallyfy does it) |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Sequential Flow               | Steps happen one after another (default)     |
| Parallel Split (AND)          | Multiple steps happen at the same time       |
| Exclusive Gateway (XOR)       | Rules decide which single path to take next |
| Inclusive Gateway (OR)        | Rules decide which path(s) to take next    |
| Synchronization               | Waiting for multiple steps to finish         |
| Structured Loop               | Repeating steps within a process             |
| Deferred Choice               | Rules decide who gets assigned a task        |

### General steps for converting BPMN to Tallyfy

1. Look at your BPMN diagram and understand the main steps, decisions, and who does what.
2. Figure out the core logic: what needs to happen in order? When do decisions need to be made?
3. Create a new Tallyfy template.
4. Build the workflow in Tallyfy using steps, assignments, and rules to match the logic from the BPMN diagram.
5. Add necessary [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/), decision rules (conditions), and other [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/).
6. Test the Tallyfy template by running it to make sure it works as expected.
7. [Launch](/products/pro/launching/) the process for real use.
