## Converting BPMN patterns to Tallyfy

Recreate your BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) diagrams as runnable Tallyfy templates using the step-by-step builder. No technical expertise needed. Your templates become real workflows that your team can launch, track, and complete.

### Why BPMN diagrams fall short

- **Complex symbolism** - diamonds, circles, and gateways require training just to read
- **Static documentation** - diagrams can't actually run anything
- **Technical barriers** - non-technical teams can't interpret BPMN notation
- **Modification friction** - changing a single step often requires IT involvement
- **Implementation gap** - diagrams rarely match how people actually work

### Why Tallyfy works better

- **Runnable processes** - templates become real workflows you can launch and track
- **No coding needed** - if you can fill out a form, you can build a process
- **Anyone can use it** - from interns to executives, the interface is self-explanatory
- **Live updates** - change a step and it's live immediately
- **Built-in tracking** - see exactly where every process stands in real time

### BPMN pattern equivalents in Tallyfy

Every standard BPMN pattern maps to a Tallyfy feature:

| BPMN pattern | How Tallyfy handles it |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Sequential Flow               | Steps run one after another - use automation rules to enforce order |
| Parallel Split (AND)          | Multiple steps are active at the same time (default behavior) |
| Exclusive Gateway (XOR)[^1]       | Automation rules show/hide steps so only one path runs |
| Inclusive Gateway (OR)[^2]        | Automation rules show/hide steps so multiple paths can run |
| Synchronization               | Automation rules wait for multiple steps to complete before triggering |
| Structured Loop               | Reopen action lets you repeat steps within a process |
| Deferred Choice               | Automation rules conditionally assign tasks to different people |

### Steps for converting BPMN to Tallyfy

1. **Study your BPMN diagram** - identify the main steps, decision points, and responsibilities (10-15 minutes for most diagrams)
2. **Map the core logic** - note what happens in sequence and where paths split
3. **Create a new template** in Tallyfy
4. **Build your workflow** - add steps, assign them to the right people, and set up automation rules
5. **Add the details** - add [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/), configure decision rules, and set up [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/)
6. **Test run** - launch a test process and walk through it to catch issues
7. **Go live** - [launch](/products/pro/launching/) the real process

[^1]: XOR means eXclusive OR - only one path can be taken, mutually exclusive choices
[^2]: OR allows multiple paths simultaneously, unlike XOR which forces a single choice
