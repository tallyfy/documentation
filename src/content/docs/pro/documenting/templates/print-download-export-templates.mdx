## How to output templates from Tallyfy

Want to get your templates out of Tallyfy? You've got three solid options: print them on paper, save them as PDFs, or export the raw data through our API.

Here's the thing - each method works great for specific situations. Need a handout for tomorrow's training session? Print it. Sharing with the board? PDF's your friend. Building an integration or creating automated backups? That's where API export shines.

### What you need for outputting templates
- Permission to view the template you want to output
- A printer (if printing physical copies)
- A PDF viewer (if saving as PDFs)
- Technical knowledge or developer help (if using API export)

Pretty straightforward requirements. Nothing fancy.

### Accessing templates for output

To print or download a template, you need to switch to "read mode" first - the print option won't show up if you're still editing. This catches a lot of people off guard (we've all been there).

<Steps>
1. Go to the **Templates** section in the library
2. Find the template you need
3. Click the **View** icon for that template

4. **Important**: Make sure you're in viewing mode (not editing mode) by checking the toggle switch at the top. If you're in edit mode, toggle the switch to "View" or "Read" mode
5. The print option will now be available in the **More** menu
</Steps>

**Note:** Can't see the print option? You're probably still in edit mode. Just flip that toggle to read/view mode and it'll appear. Happens to everyone.

### Printing physical copies

Sometimes you just need paper. Maybe you're running a workshop with no WiFi, or your team prefers marking up physical copies. Here's how to print your templates:

<Steps>
1. While viewing the template, click **More** in the top toolbar
2. Choose **Print** from the menu
   ![Accessing print options](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-click-print.png)
3. Your browser's print window will open
   - Make sure your printer is selected under **Destination**
   - Adjust settings like paper size or margins if needed
4. Click **Print**
</Steps>

### Saving as PDF documents

PDFs are perfect when you need to email templates to stakeholders or keep a digital backup. The process is almost identical to printing - you just change one setting.

<Steps>
1. While viewing the template, click **More > Print** in the top toolbar
2. Your browser's print window will open
3. Change the **Destination** to **Save as PDF** (or similar option like "Microsoft Print to PDF")
4. Adjust paper size or margins if needed
5. Click **Save**
6. Choose where to save the PDF file on your computer
7. Give the file a name
8. Click **Save** again
</Steps>

### API export for technical users

Got a developer on your team? Or maybe you're technically savvy yourself? The API export option lets you pull template data programmatically - incredibly useful for backups or when you're moving dozens of templates at once.

#### What API export does
- Exports everything about your template as JSON data (think of it as the raw blueprint)
- Creates rock-solid backups you can restore from
- Lets you automate bulk operations - imagine backing up 200 templates every night automatically

Perfect for enterprise teams who need serious template management capabilities.

#### Implementing API export
<Steps>
1. Go to our [API Support GitHub repository](https://github.com/tallyfy/api-support/tree/master/Backup%20Blueprints)
2. Download the Python script provided for exporting templates ("blueprints")
3. Set up the script with your Tallyfy API key and secret
4. Run the script (requires Python installed on your computer)
5. The script will download your template data as JSON files (usually takes under 30 seconds) - keep these files somewhere safe
</Steps>

### Choosing the right output method

Not sure which option to pick? This table breaks it down:

| Method     | Best Use                               | Format   | Prerequisites | Time Required |
|------------|----------------------------------------|----------|---------------|---------------|
| Print      | Paper copy for meetings, offline use  | Paper    | Printer access| 2-3 minutes   |
| Save as PDF| Sharing digital copy, documentation    | PDF file | PDF viewer    | 1-2 minutes   |
| API Export | Backups, moving templates, automation | JSON file| Coding skills | 5-10 minutes  |

Quick rule of thumb: if you're sharing with non-technical folks, go PDF. If you're doing anything programmatic, use the API.

### Troubleshooting: Can't find the print option?

Still can't find that print button? Don't worry - this trips up almost everyone at first.

1. **Check your mode**: You're probably in edit mode. Look for the toggle switch at the top
2. **Switch modes**: Flip it to "View" or "Read" mode
3. **Refresh if needed**: The **Print** option should now appear in the **More** menu

Why does Tallyfy hide the print option in edit mode? Simple - it prevents you from accidentally printing half-finished templates. Once you know this quirk, you'll never get stuck again.
