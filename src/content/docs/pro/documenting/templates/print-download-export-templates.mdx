## Options for printing, downloading, or exporting templates

Tallyfy gives you several ways to get your [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) information out of the platform, whether you need a paper copy, a digital PDF file, or a data export for backups or technical use.

### What you need
- Permission to view the template you want to output.
- A printer (if printing).
- A PDF viewer (if saving as PDF).
- Technical knowledge or developer help (if using the [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) export).

### Finding the Template to output

<Steps>
1. Go to the **Templates** section in the library.
2. Find the template you need.
3. Click the **View** icon for that template.

<Steps>
1. While viewing the template, click **More > Print** in the top toolbar.
2. Your browser's print window will open.
3. Change the **Destination** to **Save as PDF** (or similar option like "Microsoft Print to PDF").
4. Adjust paper size or margins if needed.
5. Click **Save**.
6. Choose where to save the PDF file on your computer.
7. Give the file a name.
8. Click **Save** again.

### Exporting template data using the API (Advanced)

For technical users, backups, or moving many templates, you can export template data using code.

#### What the API export does
- Exports the full template details in JSON format (a common data format).
- Useful for creating backups or moving templates to other systems.
- Can be automated using scripts.

#### How to use the API export script
<Steps>
1. Go to our [API Support GitHub repository](https://github.com/tallyfy/api-support/tree/master/Backup%20Blueprints).
2. Download the Python script provided for exporting templates ("blueprints").
3. Set up the script with your Tallyfy API key and secret.
4. Run the script (requires Python installed on your computer).
5. The script will download the template data as JSON files. Store these files safely.
</Steps>
