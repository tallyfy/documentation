## Printing, downloading, and exporting templates

Tallyfy offers multiple ways to get template information out of the platform - physical printing, digital PDF creation, and structured data exports.

These output options support various use cases from creating paper copies for offline reference to generating digital backups and enabling technical integrations in minutes.

Each method serves different needs, from simple documentation to complex technical work.

### What you need for outputting templates
- Permission to view the template you want to output
- A printer (if printing physical copies)
- A PDF viewer (if saving as PDFs)
- Technical knowledge or developer help (if using API export)

These requirements make sure you have the right access and tools for your chosen method.

### Accessing templates for output

To print or download a template, you must first switch to "read mode" (viewing mode). The print option is only available when viewing a template - not when editing it.

<Steps>
1. Go to the **Templates** section in the library
2. Find the template you need
3. Click the **View** icon for that template

4. **Important**: Make sure you're in viewing mode (not editing mode) by checking the toggle switch at the top. If you're in edit mode, toggle the switch to "View" or "Read" mode
5. The print option will now be available in the **More** menu
</Steps>

**Note:** If you can't find the print option, you're likely still in edit mode. Switch to read/view mode first - this is the most common reason users can't find the print feature.

### Printing physical copies

Print a template for meetings, training, or offline reference when digital access is unavailable or impractical.

<Steps>
1. While viewing the template, click **More** in the top toolbar
2. Choose **Print** from the menu

3. Your browser's print window will open
   - Make sure your printer is selected under **Destination**
   - Adjust settings like paper size or margins if needed
4. Click **Print**
</Steps>

### Saving as PDF documents

Create a PDF file to easily share a digital copy of the template with stakeholders or for archival purposes.

<Steps>
1. While viewing the template, click **More > Print** in the top toolbar
2. Your browser's print window will open
3. Change the **Destination** to **Save as PDF** (or similar option like "Microsoft Print to PDF")
4. Adjust paper size or margins if needed
5. Click **Save**
6. Choose where to save the PDF file on your computer
7. Give the file a name
8. Click **Save** again
</Steps>

### API export for technical users

For technical users, backups, or moving many templates, you can export template data using code for advanced integration scenarios.

#### What API export does
- Exports the full template details in JSON format (a common data format) for system integration
- Useful for creating backups or moving templates to other systems efficiently
- Can be automated using scripts for bulk operations and scheduled backups

This approach lets you do advanced template management for enterprise needs.

#### Implementing API export
<Steps>
1. Go to our [API Support GitHub repository](https://github.com/tallyfy/api-support/tree/master/Backup%20Blueprints)
2. Download the Python script provided for exporting templates ("blueprints")
3. Set up the script with your Tallyfy API key and secret
4. Run the script (requires Python installed on your computer)
5. The script will download the template data as JSON files in under 30 seconds - store these files safely
</Steps>

### Choosing the right output method

| Method     | Best Use                               | Format   | Prerequisites | Time Required |
|------------|----------------------------------------|----------|---------------|---------------|
| Print      | Paper copy for meetings, offline use  | Paper    | Printer access| 2-3 minutes   |
| Save as PDF| Sharing digital copy, documentation    | PDF file | PDF viewer    | 1-2 minutes   |
| API Export | Backups, moving templates, automation | JSON file| Coding skills | 5-10 minutes  |

Choose the method that fits your use case and technical resources.

### Troubleshooting: Can't find the print option?

If you can't find the print option in the **More** menu:

1. **Check your mode**: You must be in read/view mode, not edit mode. Look for a toggle switch at the top of the template viewer
2. **Switch modes**: If you're in edit mode, toggle the switch to "View" or "Read" mode
3. **Refresh if needed**: After switching modes, the **More** menu should now show the **Print** option

This is the most common issue users face when trying to print templates. The print feature is intentionally disabled in edit mode to prevent printing incomplete or draft versions.
