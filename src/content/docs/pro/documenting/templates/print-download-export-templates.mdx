## How can I print, download, and export Tallyfy templates for different purposes?

Tallyfy provides multiple output methods for extracting template information from the platform, accommodating diverse needs including physical printing, digital PDF creation, and structured data exports.

These flexible output options support various use cases from creating paper copies for offline reference to generating digital backups and enabling technical integrations through comprehensive data exports.

Each output method serves different organizational needs, from simple documentation to complex technical integrations.

### What prerequisites are needed to output templates?
- Permission to view the template you want to output for security compliance.
- A printer (if printing physical copies).
- A PDF viewer (if saving as PDF documents).
- Technical knowledge or developer help (if using the API export for data integration).

These requirements ensure you have the necessary access and tools for your chosen output method.

### How can I locate and access the template for output?

<Steps>
1. Go to the **Templates** section in the library.
2. Find the template you need.

</Steps>

### How can I save templates as PDF documents?

Create a PDF file to easily share a digital copy of the template with stakeholders or for archival purposes.

<Steps>
1. While viewing the template, click **More > Print** in the top toolbar.
2. Your browser's print window will open.
3. Change the **Destination** to **Save as PDF** (or similar option like "Microsoft Print to PDF").
4. Adjust paper size or margins if needed.
5. Click **Save**.
6. Choose where to save the PDF file on your computer.
7. Give the file a name.
8. Click **Save** again.
</Steps>

### How can I export template data using the API for technical purposes?

For technical users, backups, or moving many templates, you can export template data using code for advanced integration scenarios.

#### What does the API export accomplish?
- Exports the full template details in JSON format (a common data format) for system integration.
- Useful for creating backups or moving templates to other systems efficiently.
- Can be automated using scripts for bulk operations and scheduled backups.

This approach enables sophisticated template management workflows for enterprise environments.

#### How can I implement the API export script?
<Steps>
1. Go to our [API Support GitHub repository](https://github.com/tallyfy/api-support/tree/master/Backup%20Blueprints).
2. Download the Python script provided for exporting templates ("blueprints").
3. Set up the script with your Tallyfy API key and secret.
4. Run the script (requires Python installed on your computer).
5. The script will download the template data as JSON files. Store these files safely.
</Steps>

### Which output method should I choose for my specific needs?

| Method     | Best Use                               | Format   | Prerequisites |
|------------|----------------------------------------|----------|---------------|
| Print      | Paper copy for meetings, offline use  | Paper    | Printer access|
| Save as PDF| Sharing digital copy, documentation    | PDF file | PDF viewer    |
| API Export | Backups, moving templates, automation | JSON file| Coding skills |

Choose the method that best aligns with your intended use case and available technical resources.
