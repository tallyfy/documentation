## How to output templates from Tallyfy

You can get templates out of Tallyfy three ways - print on paper, save as PDF, or export raw data through the API[^1].

### Prerequisites
- Read permission on the template
- A printer (for physical copies)
- Technical or developer help (for API export)

### Print a template

Click **More** in the template toolbar, then choose **Print**. Tallyfy automatically switches to read mode before opening your browser's print dialog.

<Steps>
1. Go to the **Templates** section in the library
2. Click the **View** icon for the template you want

3. Click **More** in the top toolbar, then choose **Print**

4. Select your printer under **Destination** and adjust paper size or margins if needed
5. Click **Print**
</Steps>

:::tip[Can't see the print option?]
You need read permission on the template. If you have permission but still don't see it, switch the toggle at the top from edit mode to "View" or "Read" mode.
:::

### Save as PDF

The PDF option uses the same print flow - you just change the destination.

<Steps>
1. Open the template and click **More > Print** in the top toolbar
2. Change the **Destination** to **Save as PDF** (or "Microsoft Print to PDF")
3. Adjust paper size or margins if needed
4. Click **Save**, choose a location, name the file, and click **Save** again
</Steps>

### API export for technical users

The API lets you pull template data programmatically as JSON[^2] - useful for backups or moving many templates at once.

:::note[Template sharing between organizations]
**Direct template sharing between different Tallyfy organizations isn't currently available**. To share templates with other organizations, export via API and have them recreate the template manually.
:::

#### What API export gives you
- Your full template structure and settings as a JSON file
- Reliable backups you can restore from
- The ability to automate bulk operations - back up hundreds of templates on a schedule

#### How to set it up
<Steps>
1. Go to the [API Support GitHub repository](https://github.com/tallyfy/api-support/tree/master/Backup%20Blueprints)
2. Download the Python script for exporting templates ("blueprints")
3. Configure the script with your Tallyfy API key and secret
4. Run the script (requires Python) - it downloads template data as JSON files
</Steps>

### Choosing the right method

| Method     | Best for                               | Format   | You'll need   |
|------------|----------------------------------------|----------|---------------|
| Print      | Paper copies for meetings, offline use | Paper    | Printer access|
| Save as PDF| Sharing digitally, documentation       | PDF file | PDF viewer    |
| API Export | Backups, bulk moves, automation        | JSON file| Coding skills |

Sharing with non-technical people? Use PDF. Doing anything programmatic? Use the API.
