## How to create templates in Tallyfy

Templates are the starting point for your Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). Think of them as reusable sets of instructions or forms that help automate your work.

### Why creating templates is important

Creating well-designed templates saves significant time and ensures consistency across your organization. A good template eliminates the need to reinvent processes each time, reduces training time for new team members, and helps prevent errors. Taking the time to create a thoughtful template upfront means every future use of that process will be more efficient and reliable.

Only "Standard" members (if an Admin allows them) or "Administrator" members can create new templates. [Members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) with a "Light" role cannot create templates.

To start creating a template:

<Steps>
1. Click the **+Create** button (usually at the top left).
2. Choose **Create a template** from the menu that appears.
3. Pick one of the three ways to create your template (explained below).
</Steps>

Tallyfy gives you three ways to make a new template:

1. Start from scratch (blank)
2. Get help from Tallyfy AI
3. Upload an existing document (like an SOP)

### Create a template from scratch

Starting from scratch gives you a blank page to build your [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) exactly how you want. This is best if your process is unique or needs a lot of specific details.

To create a template from scratch:
<Steps>
1. Choose the **From scratch** option.
2. Give your template a name.
3. Tallyfy will open the template editor, where you can add steps, fields, and other details.
</Steps>

### Create a template using Tallyfy AI

If you're not sure how to start, Tallyfy AI can create a basic template for you. Just tell the AI what the process is about.

When you use the Tallyfy AI option or upload a document directly (see next section), the AI analyzes your request or document and generates a template. This is a **non-exact** method. The AI might rephrase steps, remove redundant information, or restructure the content to create what it determines is the best Tallyfy template. It aims to optimize the process for Tallyfy, not create a perfect copy of the original input.

The better you describe the process in the template name box, the better the template the AI creates will be. Think about the main steps or goals.

To create a template with Tallyfy AI:
<Steps>
1. Choose the **Tallyfy AI** option.
2. Select the *type* of template: **Procedure** (for step-by-step tasks, SOPs, or how-to guides like employee onboarding or purchase approvals) or **Document** (for info guides, policies, or reference material like a social media policy or a client contact list).
3. Type a clear, detailed name or description of the process in the name box (e.g., "Onboard a new marketing employee" instead of just "Onboarding").
4. *(Optional)* Tell the AI your type of company to help it make the template more relevant.
5. *(Optional)* Choose your preferred [language](/products/pro/miscellaneous/how-can-i-translate-content-in-tallyfy/).
6. Click **Create**.
7. The AI will generate a template. Look it over in the editor and change anything needed to make it perfect for you.
</Steps>

### Create a template by uploading an existing document

If you already have instructions written down (like in a Word doc or PDF), you can upload that file. Tallyfy's AI will read it and try to automatically turn it into a Tallyfy [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). This is great for turning old Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) into processes you can actually track in Tallyfy.

Similar to creating with AI, uploading a document directly uses AI for **non-exact** conversion. The AI analyzes the document and may modify content, formatting, or structure to create an optimized Tallyfy template. It prioritizes creating a functional Tallyfy process over making an exact replica of your source file.

File types that usually work:
- Microsoft Word (`.doc`, `.docx`)
- PDF (`.pdf`)
- Flowcharts (common image files might work - check the upload tool for details)

To create a template by uploading a file:
<Steps>
1. Choose the **From SOP document** option.
2. Upload your Word, PDF, or flowchart file.
   * Important: The file cannot be password-protected.
   * Max file size is 30MB.
3. Choose how you want Tallyfy to create the template: **Document** (best for information pages, policies, or reference lists like a social media policy or a list of WiFi passwords) or **Procedure** (best for step-by-step workflows you want to track, like an employee onboarding checklist or a purchase approval process).
4. Tallyfy will create a template based on your file. Review it in the editor and make any changes needed.

</Steps>

### Exact import via AI (Manual HTML conversion)

In some situations, especially for compliance or legal reasons, you might need to create a Tallyfy template that is an *exact*, verbatim copy of your original source document (like a Word or PDF SOP), without any AI modifications. Tallyfy does not offer a direct "exact import" feature, but you can achieve this manually with AI assistance by converting your source document to clean HTML first.

**Why use Exact Import?**

-   **Compliance:** Ensures the documented process in Tallyfy exactly matches an approved, audited source document.
-   **Legal Requirements:** Maintains the precise wording and structure required by regulations or contracts.
-   **Preservation:** Faithfully reproduces a specific version of a document without any interpretation by AI.

**Steps for Exact Import:**

<Steps>
1.  **Convert Source to HTML:** Use an AI tool (like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) to convert your source document (Word, PDF) into clean HTML. Provide a prompt focused on exact, unstyled conversion.

    *Example AI Prompt:*
    ```text
    I will upload a PDF of a process (SOP). Your job is to exactly convert every part of the file without changing anything at all into HTML. You must not change any content - it must remain like-for-like. You must cleanly convert tables into HTML tables. You can include the first header in the document if there is one but you don't need to add headers for every page in the document - just the first page. You must use proper semantic headings such as h1, h2, h3, h4, etc. as you see them in the document itself. You must not add any styling or CSS at all unless bold or italic is strictly necessary and occurs in the original document. Ignore all colors in the original document. If you see images in the original document, ignore those but leave a placeholder and caption to indicate where the image would go. All your output must be HTML markup that is clean and structured.
    ```
2.  **Enable HTML Mode in Tallyfy:** Go to **Settings** > **Organization** in Tallyfy and ensure that the HTML editor mode is enabled for content editing. 
3.  **Paste HTML into Tallyfy:** Create a new template **From scratch**. In the Tallyfy editor (ensure it's in HTML mode), paste *only the `<body>` content* of the HTML generated by the AI. Do not paste the full HTML document including `<head>` or `<html>` tags.
4.  **Review and Save:** Review the pasted content in Tallyfy. It should closely mirror your original document's structure and text. Save the template.
</Steps>

You now have a template that is a verbatim HTML representation of your source document.
