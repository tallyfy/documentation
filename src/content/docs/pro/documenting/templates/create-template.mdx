## How to create templates in Tallyfy

Templates serve as the building blocks for your [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). They are reusable, customizable workflows that automate your business processes.

:::note[Role permission requirement]
[Members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) with a "Light" role cannot create or edit templates. Only members with a "Standard" role (if they have appropriate permissions) or "Administrator" role can create templates.
:::

To create a template:

<Steps>
1. Click the **Create** button at the top of the left sidebar.
2. Select **Create a template** from the dropdown menu.
3. Choose one of the three template creation methods.
</Steps>

Tallyfy offers three template creation methods:

1. From scratch
2. Using Tallyfy AI
3. Uploading an SOP document

### Create a template from scratch

Creating a template from scratch gives you a blank canvas to build your [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). This option works best for unique processes that require customization.

To create a template from scratch:
<Steps>
1. Select the **From scratch** option.
2. Enter a name for your template.
3. You'll be directed to the template editor where you can build your process.
</Steps>

### Create a template using Tallyfy AI

Tallyfy AI helps you generate a starting point for your template when you're unsure where to begin. You initiate this by providing a descriptive name or prompt for your desired template.
The AI uses this prompt to generate a relevant template structure.

:::tip[Provide Detailed Prompts]
The more detailed and specific your prompt is in the template name box, the better and more tailored the generated template structure will be. Think about the key stages or outcomes of your process.
:::

To create a template with Tallyfy AI:
<Steps>
1. Select the **Tallyfy AI** option.
2. Select your template type. Choose **Procedure** for step-by-step workflows or **Document** for policies/guides.
3. Enter a detailed, meaningful name or prompt for your template in the name box.
4. *(Optional)* Specify your company type to refine the output.
5. *(Optional)* Specify your preferred [language](/products/pro/miscellaneous/how-can-i-translate-content-in-tallyfy/) to refine the output.
6. Click **Create**.
7. Review the AI-generated template in the editor and make any necessary adjustments to match your needs.
</Steps>

### Create a template by uploading an existing document

Migrate your existing process documentation into Tallyfy by uploading documents you already use. Tallyfy's AI will analyze the content and automatically structure it into a digital Tallyfy [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). This is a useful way to transition static documentation (like Standard Operating Procedures) into a dynamic, trackable format.

Supported file types include:
- Microsoft Word documents (`.doc`, `.docx`)
- Portable Document Format files (`.pdf`)
- Flowcharts (common image formats or specific flowchart file types may be supported - check the upload interface for specifics)

To create a template from an existing document:
<Steps>
1. Select the **From SOP document** option.
2. Upload your document (`.doc`, `.docx`, `.pdf`) or flowchart file.
   * Document must not be password-protected or encrypted.
   * Maximum file size: 30MB.
3. Choose your preferred output format. Select **Document** for reference materials or **Procedure** for trackable workflows.
4. Review the AI-generated template in the editor and make any necessary adjustments.
