## How to create templates in Tallyfy

Templates are the starting point for your Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). Think of them as reusable sets of instructions or forms that help automate your work.

:::note[Who can create templates?]
[Members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) with a "Light" role cannot create templates. Only "Standard" members (if an Admin allows them) or "Administrator" members can create new templates.
:::

To start creating a template:

<Steps>
1. Click the **+Create** button (usually at the top left).
2. Choose **Create a template** from the menu that appears.
3. Pick one of the three ways to create your template (explained below).
</Steps>

Tallyfy gives you three ways to make a new template:

1. Start from scratch (blank)
2. Get help from Tallyfy AI
3. Upload an existing document (like an SOP)

### Create a template from scratch

Starting from scratch gives you a blank page to build your [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) exactly how you want. This is best if your process is unique or needs a lot of specific details.

To create a template from scratch:
<Steps>
1. Choose the **From scratch** option.
2. Give your template a name.
3. Tallyfy will open the template editor, where you can add steps, fields, and other details.
</Steps>

### Create a template using Tallyfy AI

If you're not sure how to start, Tallyfy AI can create a basic template for you. Just tell the AI what the process is about.

:::tip[Give the AI good details!]
The better you describe the process in the template name box, the better the template the AI creates will be. Think about the main steps or goals.
:::

To create a template with Tallyfy AI:
<Steps>
1. Choose the **Tallyfy AI** option.
2. Select the *type* of template: **Procedure** (for step-by-step tasks) or **Document** (for info guides or policies).
3. Type a clear, detailed name or description of the process in the name box (e.g., "Onboard a new marketing employee" instead of just "Onboarding").
4. *(Optional)* Tell the AI your type of company to help it make the template more relevant.
5. *(Optional)* Choose your preferred [language](/products/pro/miscellaneous/how-can-i-translate-content-in-tallyfy/).
6. Click **Create**.
7. The AI will generate a template. Look it over in the editor and change anything needed to make it perfect for you.
</Steps>

### Create a template by uploading an existing document

If you already have instructions written down (like in a Word doc or PDF), you can upload that file. Tallyfy's AI will read it and try to automatically turn it into a Tallyfy [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). This is great for turning old Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) into processes you can actually track in Tallyfy.

File types that usually work:
- Microsoft Word (`.doc`, `.docx`)
- PDF (`.pdf`)
- Flowcharts (common image files might work - check the upload tool for details)

To create a template by uploading a file:
<Steps>
1. Choose the **From SOP document** option.
2. Upload your Word, PDF, or flowchart file.
   * Important: The file cannot be password-protected.
   * Max file size is 30MB.
3. Choose how you want Tallyfy to create the template: **Document** (best for information pages) or **Procedure** (best for step-by-step workflows you want to track).
4. Tallyfy will create a template based on your file. Review it in the editor and make any changes needed.
