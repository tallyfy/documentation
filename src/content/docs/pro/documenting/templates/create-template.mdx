## Creating templates in Tallyfy

Click **+Create** and choose from three options: start from scratch, use Tallyfy AI, or upload an existing document. Templates are reusable blueprints you build once, then launch as many times as you need.

Only "Administrator" members and "Standard" members (when allowed by an Admin) can create templates. [Members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) with a "Light" role can only run processes from existing templates.

<Steps>
1. Click the **+Create** button
2. Choose **Create a template**
3. Pick one of three creation methods (explained below)
</Steps>

### From scratch

Choose this when your process is unique or needs precise control over every step, field, and automation rule.

<Steps>
1. Choose the **From scratch** tab
2. Give your template a name
3. Pick the template type - **Procedure** (step-by-step workflow) or **Document** (reference material, policies)
4. Tallyfy opens the template editor where you'll add steps, fields, and details
</Steps>

### Using Tallyfy AI

Describe your process and Tallyfy AI generates a working template in seconds. The AI doesn't just copy your input - it rephrases confusing steps, removes redundancy, and restructures everything for digital execution.

The more specific your description, the better. Instead of "employee onboarding," try "onboard a remote software developer including laptop setup, account access, and first-week training."

<Steps>
1. Choose the **From Tallyfy AI** tab
2. Select the template type: **Procedure** (for step-by-step tasks, SOPs, or workflows like employee onboarding or purchase approvals) or **Document** (for policies, reference material, or info guides)
3. Type a clear, detailed description in the name box (e.g., "Onboard a new marketing employee" not just "Onboarding")
4. *(Optional)* Tell the AI your company type for more relevant results
5. *(Optional)* Choose your preferred [language](/products/pro/miscellaneous/how-can-i-translate-content-in-tallyfy/) - 13 languages available including English, Spanish, German, Japanese, and more
6. Click **Create**
7. Review the generated template in the editor and tweak as needed
</Steps>

### Uploading documents

Got a Word doc or PDF with your process already written out? Upload it and Tallyfy AI transforms it into a trackable workflow. The AI reads your document, then rebuilds it for digital execution - cleaning up redundancies and restructuring for clarity.

Supported file types:
- Microsoft Word (`.doc`, `.docx`)
- PDF (`.pdf`)

<Steps>
1. Choose the **From an existing SOP** tab
2. Upload your Word or PDF file
3. Tallyfy AI analyzes the document and generates steps - review them in the editor and adjust as needed

</Steps>

### Exact import for compliance

Sometimes you need every word exactly as written - no AI interpretation. Think compliance docs, legal requirements, audited SOPs. There's no one-click "exact import" button, but here's the workaround: convert your document to clean HTML first, then paste it into Tallyfy.

**Why use exact import?**

-   **Compliance** - your Tallyfy template matches your approved source document character for character
-   **Legal requirements** - preserves exact wording and structure regulations demand
-   **Preservation** - creates a digital twin with no AI rewording

<Steps>
1.  **Convert to HTML** - use an AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) to convert your document into clean HTML. Use a specific prompt:

    *Example AI Prompt:*
    ```text
    I will upload a PDF of a process (SOP). Your job is to exactly convert every part of the file without changing anything at all into HTML. You must not change any content - it must remain like-for-like. You must cleanly convert tables into HTML tables. You can include the first header in the document if there is one but you don't need to add headers for every page in the document - just the first page. You must use proper semantic headings such as h1, h2, h3, h4, etc. as you see them in the document itself. You must not add any styling or CSS at all unless bold or italic is strictly necessary and occurs in the original document. Ignore all colors in the original document. If you see images in the original document, ignore those but leave a placeholder and caption to indicate where the image would go. All your output must be HTML markup that is clean and structured.
    ```
2.  **Check HTML mode** - go to **Settings** > **Organization** in Tallyfy and confirm HTML editor mode is enabled. With HTML mode, you can also create advanced features like [mailto: links with variables](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/edit-task/how-can-i-use-tallyfys-rich-text-editor-for-tasks/#how-can-i-create-one-click-email-links-using-html-mode)
3.  **Paste HTML** - create a new template **From scratch**. Switch the editor to HTML mode, then paste *only the `<body>` content* from the AI's output. Skip the `<head>` and `<html>` tags.
4.  **Review and save** - check how it looks in Tallyfy. It should mirror your original document exactly.
