## How to create templates in Tallyfy

Templates serve as the building blocks for your processes. They are reusable, customizable workflows that automate your business processes.

To create a template:

Tallyfy offers three template creation methods:

1. From scratch
2. Using Tallyfy AI
3. Uploading an SOP document

## Create a template from scratch

Creating a template from scratch gives you a blank canvas to build your process. This option works best for unique processes that require customization.

To create a template from scratch:
1. Select the **From scratch** option.
2. Enter a name for your template.
3. You'll be directed to the template editor where you can build your process.

## Create a template using Tallyfy AI

Tallyfy AI helps you generate a starting point for your template when you're unsure where to begin. You initiate this by providing a descriptive name or prompt for your desired template.
The AI uses this prompt to generate a relevant template structure.

:::tip[Provide Detailed Prompts]
The more detailed and specific your prompt is in the template name box, the better and more tailored the generated template structure will be. Think about the key stages or outcomes of your process.

To create a template with Tallyfy AI:
1. Select the **Tallyfy AI** option.
2. Choose your template type (**Procedure** or **Document**).
3. Enter a detailed, meaningful name or prompt for your template in the name box.
4. *(Optional)* Specify your company type and preferred language to further refine the output.
5. Click **Create**.
6. Review the AI-generated template in the editor and make any necessary adjustments to perfectly match your needs.

## Create a template by uploading an existing document

Seamlessly migrate your existing process documentation into Tallyfy by uploading documents you already use. Tallyfy's AI will analyze the content and automatically structure it into a digital Tallyfy template. This is an excellent way to transition static documentation (like Standard Operating Procedures) into a dynamic, trackable format.

Supported file types include:
- Microsoft Word documents (`.doc`, `.docx`)
- Portable Document Format files (`.pdf`)
- Flowcharts (common image formats or specific flowchart file types may be supported - check the upload interface for specifics)

To create a template from an existing document:
1. Select the **From SOP document** option.
2. Upload your document (`.doc`, `.docx`, `.pdf`) or flowchart file.
   * Document must not be password-protected or encrypted.
   * Maximum file size: 30MB.
3. Choose your preferred output format:
   * **Document**: Creates a cleaned-up, HTML version of your upload with simplified formatting and reorganized sections.
   * **Procedure**: Converts your upload into a step-by-step Tallyfy workflow process.
4. Review the AI-generated template in the editor and make any necessary adjustments.
