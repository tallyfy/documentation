## Working with templates

Templates are reusable blueprints that turn your processes into trackable workflows. Create once, reuse forever. When you launch a template, Tallyfy creates a live process - assigning tasks, sending reminders, and tracking progress automatically.

Update a template once and every future process gets the fix.

### The three-stage approach

1. **Document** - Capture your process knowledge in a template
2. **Run** - Launch consistent, trackable processes every time
3. **Improve** - Improve based on real data and feedback

### Common problems templates solve

Every time someone asks "How do we do this again?", you're losing money. Templates fix that.

- **Quality varies wildly** - same process, different results depending on who does it
- **Time bleeds away** - people reinvent workflows daily instead of doing actual work
- **Knowledge walks out the door** - when Sarah leaves, her process expertise leaves too
- **Onboarding takes weeks** - new hires fumble through undocumented processes

Tallyfy templates become your single source of truth. Fix the template once, everyone benefits instantly.

:::note[Template vs. Blueprint]
In the Tallyfy app, we call these **Templates**. In the Tallyfy API, they're called **Blueprints** (or "checklists" internally). Same thing, different names.
:::

### Key benefits

- **Same process, same quality** - every client gets your A-game service
- **Create once, use 1000x** - launch that onboarding template for every new hire in seconds
- **Zero interpretation** - clear steps mean no confusion
- **Scale without chaos** - handle 10x more work with the same team

### Template types

Tallyfy has three template types:

1. **Procedure templates** - multi-step workflows that run from start to finish.
   - All tasks appear at once by default (parallel). Need sequential order? Use automation rules to show tasks only after previous steps complete.
   - Add if-this-then-that rules ("If budget > $5000, add CFO approval")
   - Auto-assign to people, groups, or job titles[^1]
   - Collect data with form fields that validate entries
   - Connect to your other tools via integrations

:::note[Tallyfy approach vs. flowcharts]
Instead of flowcharts, Tallyfy uses a checklist style for steps, combined with "if-this-then-that" rules. This makes processes easier to understand and follow while still handling decisions and different paths.
:::

2. **Document templates** - policies, handbooks, and reference materials.
   - Lock down sections that can't change (legal disclaimers stay perfect)
   - Add fill-in fields for custom details
   - Use snippets[^2] - update once, changes flow to all documents instantly

3. **Form templates** - structured data collection forms for gathering information without a multi-step workflow.

Use procedure templates when you need trackable multi-step workflows. Use document templates for reference materials. Use form templates for standalone data collection.

### Knowledge-only mode

Not every procedure needs tracking. [Knowledge-only mode](/products/pro/tutorials/knowledge-only-mode/) lets you publish templates as searchable reference materials without launching a formal process.

Good for:
- How-to guides and SOPs teams reference while working
- Training materials and best practices
- Company policies and guidelines

### Template lifecycle

#### 1. Creation
   - **From scratch** - build custom workflows step by step
   - **AI-powered** - describe your process, Tallyfy generates the template
   - **Upload existing docs** - turn a Word SOP into a live workflow
   - **Clone and tweak** - copy an existing template and modify it

#### 2. Management
   - **Folders** - organize by team, client type, or frequency
   - **Tags** - filter by "customer-facing" or "compliance" instantly
   - **Permissions** - control who can view, edit, launch, or duplicate each template
   - **Ownership** - assign a template owner who's responsible for updates
   - **Archive** - soft-delete templates from active view without permanent removal

#### 3. Launch
   - **Kick-off form** - fill in details, Tallyfy handles the rest
   - **Pre-set assignments** - tasks go to the right people, groups, or job titles automatically
   - **Live tracking** - see exactly where every process stands

:::note[Template vs. Process: Building analogy]
A **template** is like a **master blueprint** for a house. It defines the standard design.

**Launching a process** is like building a specific house from that blueprint. Each house (each running process) is unique and needs its own name so you can track it separately.
:::

### Can I nest a template inside another template?

Yes - two ways:

1. **Content embedding** - use [snippets](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/) to embed reusable content within task descriptions.

2. **Runtime injection** - use the ["launch another process"](/products/pro/launching/launch-process-when-task-is-completed/) feature with **"inject tasks into existing process"** to add another template's steps into a running process.

import PageTree from '@/components/PageTree.astro';

<PageTree />

## Template organization

Templates not placed in folders appear in the **Uncategorized** view. The Uncategorized folder is a system folder that can't be deleted.

To organize templates:
1. Go to **Templates** and select **Uncategorized**
2. Click the folder icon next to any template
3. Choose **Move to folder** and pick or create a destination folder
