## Understanding Tallyfy templates

Templates are the foundation of Tallyfy, serving as reusable blueprints for standardized business processes and documents. They define the structure, steps, and content that should be followed consistently across your organization.

### Key concepts

- **Master blueprints** - Templates define the standard for how processes should run
- **Reusability** - Create once, launch multiple times
- **Consistency** - Ensure every process instance follows the same standards
- **Scalability** - Templates make it possible to scale operations efficiently

### Types of templates

Tallyfy offers two primary template types:

1. **Procedure templates** - Define step-by-step workflows with:
   - Sequential or parallel task execution
   - Conditional logic and branching
   - Role-based assignments
   - Form fields for data collection
   - Automations for process efficiency

2. **Document templates** - Create standardized document formats with:
   - Fixed (read-only) content
   - Editable fields for customization
   - Consistent formatting and structure
   - Reusable content blocks (snippets)

### Template lifecycle

1. **Creation** - Build templates by:
   - Starting from scratch
   - Using AI-generated templates
   - Converting existing documents
   - Importing from other sources
   - Duplicating existing templates

2. **Management** - Organize templates with:
   - Folders and subfolders
   - Tags for categorization
   - Version control
   - Access permissions

3. **Execution** - Launch templates as processes:
   - Fill in initial data
   - Assign to appropriate team members
   - Monitor progress
   - Track completion

### Benefits of template-based processes

- **Quality assurance** - Standardized execution reduces errors and variability
- **Onboarding efficiency** - New team members can follow established processes
- **Process improvement** - Refine templates over time for continuous improvement
- **Knowledge management** - Templates capture institutional knowledge in an executable format
- **Compliance** - Ensure regulatory requirements are consistently met
