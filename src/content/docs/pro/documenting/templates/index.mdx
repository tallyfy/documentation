## How do Tallyfy templates work as workflow foundations?

Templates are reusable blueprints that turn your business processes into self-driving workflows. Create once, use forever - that's the power of Tallyfy templates.

Think of templates as your process playbook. They capture every step, decision point, and handoff in your workflows. When you launch a template, Tallyfy creates a live process that runs itself - assigning tasks, sending reminders, and tracking progress automatically.

The magic? Update a template once and every future process gets the improvement. No retraining needed.

### Why do workflow templates provide essential business value?

Every time someone asks "How do we do this again?", you're losing money. Templates fix that permanently.

Without templates, companies face these expensive problems:
- **Quality varies wildly** - same process, different results depending on who does it
- **Time bleeds away** - people reinvent workflows daily instead of doing actual work
- **Knowledge walks out the door** - when Sarah leaves, her process expertise leaves too
- **Onboarding takes weeks** - new hires fumble through undocumented processes

Tallyfy templates solve this in one shot. They become your single source of truth - cutting training time by 75% and virtually eliminating process errors. Better yet? Improve the template once, and everyone benefits instantly.

:::note[Template vs. Blueprint]
In the Tallyfy<sup>速</sup> app, we call these **Templates**. If you use the Tallyfy<sup>速</sup> API (for coding integrations), they are called **Blueprints**. It's the same thing, just different names.
:::

Here's what most people miss: Templates aren't just for complex workflows.

Those small, repetitive tasks your team does 20 times a week? Perfect for templates. Client check-ins, expense approvals, content reviews - Tallyfy handles these "papercut" processes that eat up hours. Create a 5-step template in minutes, save 5 hours weekly.

### What benefits do Tallyfy templates deliver?

- **Same process, same quality** - Every client gets your A-game service, not whoever's version
- **Create once, use 1000x** - That onboarding template? Launch it for every new hire in seconds
- **Zero interpretation needed** - Clear steps mean no confusion, no "I thought you meant..."
- **Scale without chaos** - Handle 10x more work with the same team

Result? 40% faster process completion and 90% fewer questions about "how to do things."

### What template types does Tallyfy offer?

Tallyfy gives you two template types that cover every business need:

1. **Procedure Templates**: Your multi-step workflows that run from start to finish.
   - Set tasks to run in order or parallel - Tallyfy figures out the timing
   - Add if-this-then-that rules ("If budget > $5000, add CFO approval")
   - Auto-assign to people or job titles - new hires get tasks immediately
   - Collect data with smart forms that validate entries
   - Connect to your other tools - no manual data entry
   - *Real examples*: Onboard employees in 5 days not 3 weeks, approve purchases in hours not days, publish content with zero missed steps

Use procedure templates when sequence matters and handoffs are critical.

:::note[Tallyfy<sup>速</sup> approach vs. flowcharts]
Instead of complex flowcharts, Tallyfy<sup>速</sup> uses a simple checklist style for steps, combined with easy "if-this-then-that" rules. This makes processes easier for everyone to understand, build, and follow, while still handling decisions and different paths. People tend to use these checklist-style processes more reliably than old flowchart diagrams.

2. **Document Templates**: Smart forms and policies that update themselves.
   - Lock down sections that can't change (legal disclaimers stay perfect)
   - Add fill-in fields for custom details - no more "[INSERT NAME HERE]" mistakes
   - Professional formatting every time - no wrestling with Word
   - Use snippets - update once, flows to all documents instantly
   - *Real examples*: Employee handbooks ready in minutes, contracts that auto-populate client data, policies that track who's read them

Use document templates for anything people need to reference or fill out - but don't need step-by-step tracking.

### What is the template lifecycle?

#### 1. Template Creation: Get templates running in under 10 minutes:
   - **From scratch**: Drag-drop interface for custom workflows
   - **AI-powered**: Describe your process, Tallyfy writes the template in 60 seconds
   - **Upload existing docs**: Turn that Word SOP into a live workflow instantly
   - **Import from anywhere**: Moving from another tool? Bring your workflows
   - **Clone and tweak**: Love your invoice process? Copy it for purchase orders

#### 2. Template Management: Find any template in 3 seconds:
   - **Smart folders**: Organize by team, client type, or frequency
   - **Tag everything**: Filter by "customer-facing" or "compliance" instantly
   - **Lock it down**: Control who sees and edits each template
   - **Clear ownership**: Template Owners get alerts about needed updates

#### 3. Template Launch: From template to running process in one click:
   - **Quick setup**: Fill a short form, Tallyfy handles the rest
   - **Smart assignments**: Tallyfy assigns based on workload and skills
   - **Live tracking**: See exactly where every process stands - clients love this

:::note[Template vs. Process: Building Analogy]
A **template** is like the **master blueprint** for a house. It defines the standard design.

When you use that blueprint to build a specific house, that's like **launching a process**. Each house built (each running process) is unique, even if based on the same blueprint. Each needs its own unique name or address (like "123 Main St Build" or "Job #567") so you can track that specific project separately.
