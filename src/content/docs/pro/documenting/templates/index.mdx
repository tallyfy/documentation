## Templates

Templates are the foundation of Tallyfy. They function as master blueprints for document templates or step-by-step procedures.

Create a template once, then launch it as a process multiple times. Templates ensure consistent, standardized execution of processes, maintaining quality with each use.

By implementing templates for repeatable processes, you can scale operations while reducing errors and oversights.
