## Understanding Tallyfy templates

Templates are the foundation of Tallyfy, serving as reusable blueprints for standardized business processes and documents. They define the structure, steps, and content that should be followed consistently across your organization.

While templates are crucial for large, complex operations, they are equally valuable for capturing the 'long tail' of processes mentioned in the [Introduction](/products/pro/). Think about the many smaller, niche workflows specific to teams or roles that often live in emails or chat. Creating templates for these ensures consistency and makes knowledge transferable, even for processes that might not be complex but happen frequently and need to be done right every time.

### Key concepts

- **Master blueprints** - Templates define the standard for how processes should run
- **Reusability** - Create once, launch multiple times
- **Consistency** - Ensure every process instance follows the same standards
- **Scalability** - Templates make it possible to scale operations efficiently

### Types of Templates

Tallyfy offers two primary template types:

1. **[Procedure templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)** - Define step-by-step workflows with:
   - Sequential or parallel [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) execution
   - Conditional logic and branching
   - [Role-based assignments](/products/pro/documenting/members/)
   - [Form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) for data collection
   - [Automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) for process efficiency

:::note[Tallyfy's checklist approach vs. flowcharts]
Unlike traditional process documentation that relies on flowcharts, Tallyfy uses a checklist-based approach enhanced with "if-this-then-that" rules. This makes processes easier to understand, create, and execute while still capturing all the decision logic and variations. The result is higher adoption rates and more consistent execution compared to static flowchart diagrams that often go unused.

2. **[Document templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/)** - Create standardized document formats with:
   - Fixed (read-only) content
   - Editable [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) for customization
   - Consistent formatting and structure
   - Reusable content blocks ([snippets](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/))

### Template lifecycle

1. **Creation** - Build templates by:
   - Starting from scratch
   - Using AI-generated templates
   - Converting existing documents
   - Importing from other sources
   - Duplicating existing templates

2. **Management** - Organize templates with:
   - Folders and subfolders for logical grouping (e.g., by department or function)
   - Tags for categorization
   - Version control
   - Access permissions
   - A designated **Template Owner** responsible for maintenance and receiving feedback

3. **Execution** - [Launch](/products/pro/launching/) templates as [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/):
   - Fill in initial data
   - Assign to appropriate team [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/)
   - Monitor progress
   - Track completion

:::note[Template vs. Process: The Blueprint and the Building]
Think of a **template** as a **master blueprint** for a house. The blueprint defines the standard design, layout, and materials. It's reusable â€“ you can use the same blueprint to build many houses.

When you decide to build a specific house using that blueprint, you **launch a process**. Each house built (each process) is a unique instance. While based on the same blueprint, each needs its own unique address or identifier (a unique **process name**) like "123 Main St House Build" or "Maple Ave Project - Unit 5". This helps you track each specific building project (process) individually, even though they all started from the same master blueprint (template).

### Benefits of Template-based processes

- **Quality assurance** - Standardized execution reduces errors and variability
- **Onboarding efficiency** - New team members can follow established [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)
- **Process improvement** - Refine templates over time for continuous improvement
- **Knowledge management** - Templates capture institutional knowledge in an executable format
- **[Compliance](/products/pro/compliance/)** - Ensure regulatory requirements are consistently met
