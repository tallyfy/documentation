## Templates

Templates are the core of Tallyfy. They're like a recipe or master version of a document template or a procedure with steps.

The idea is that you make your template once - and then you can launch it as a process tens, hundreds or even thousands of times. A template ensures a process is done right every time - in a standard, consistent and high-quality way.

By using templates on Tallyfy to run your repeatable processes you can scale up your operations and worry less about the ball being dropped or mistakes being made.
