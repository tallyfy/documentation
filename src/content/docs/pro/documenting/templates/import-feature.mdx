## Import options for templates

Import templates into Tallyfy from Word docs, PowerPoint files, flowchart images, or other Tallyfy accounts. Minutes, not hours.

:::note[Who can import templates?]
Only "Standard" [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) (if allowed by an Admin) or "Administrator" members can import templates. "Light" members can't.

### AI document conversion

Upload a Word doc or PDF, and Tallyfy's AI converts it into a working template. A 50-page SOP? Ready in seconds.

- Upload your file (Word or PDF)
- The AI reads through the content
- Choose your output:
  - **Document**: Creates a Tallyfy document with proper formatting
  - **Procedure**: Builds a step-by-step process template
- Review the result and tweak as needed

**Time savings**: Converting a 35-slide PowerPoint takes roughly 10 seconds via AI import vs. 2+ hours of manual copy-paste. Convert the file to PDF first.

:::note[Non-exact import (default)]
This AI conversion is **non-exact**. The AI may modify content, formatting, or structure to create a better Tallyfy template. It prioritizes a functional process over an exact replica of your source file.

For verbatim copies (e.g., compliance needs), see the [Exact import via AI (Manual HTML conversion)](/products/pro/documenting/templates/create-template/#exact-import-via-ai-manual-html-conversion) method in the *Create a template* article.

### Migrating PowerPoint playbooks

Convert PowerPoint playbooks and training materials into Tallyfy templates. Especially useful for enterprises with dozens or hundreds of PowerPoint files acting as operational playbooks.

:::tip[Why PowerPoint users love Tallyfy]
**The problem**: Enterprises often have 100+ similar PowerPoint files (v1, v2, v2_final, v2_final_FINAL) with slight variations. Finding the right version is a nightmare.

**The fix**: One smart template with conditional logic[^2] replaces all those versions. Twelve different files become one dynamic template that shows only relevant content based on user selections.
:::

**Quick migration steps**:
1. Export your PowerPoint as PDF
2. Upload the PDF to Tallyfy's AI import
3. Choose "Procedure" for an interactive workflow template
4. Review and add dynamic features like conditional logic

**What gets converted**:
- Slide content becomes template steps or sections
- Text boxes and tables keep their structure
- Hyperlinks are preserved as references
- Visual elements like Harvey balls[^1] are interpreted into text
- Slide titles become step headings
- Speaker notes can become step instructions

**Post-import improvements**:
- Add [conditional visibility](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/conditional-visibility-guide/) for different scenarios
- Convert static text to dynamic dropdown fields
- Use [snippets](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/) for reusable content blocks
- Set up [automation rules](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) for task assignments
- Add form fields to capture data that was previously written on printed slides

**Enterprise migration strategy**:
1. List all operational playbooks and their variations
2. Find sections that appear across multiple files
3. Convert common content to [snippets](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/) for consistency
4. Import the most complete version first as a master template
5. Add conditional logic to replace multiple files with smart branching
6. Test with users to confirm all scenarios are covered
7. Archive originals for reference but stop updating them

### AI flowchart conversion

Got flowcharts in Visio, Lucidchart, or on a whiteboard? Take a picture and Tallyfy turns it into a live template.

- Upload a clear image of your flowchart (PNG, JPG, or PDF)
- The AI reads the shapes and text
- Pick your output:
  - **Document**: Creates a Tallyfy document
  - **Procedure**: Converts each shape into a workflow step
- Review and adjust as needed

:::note[Manual setup needed for rules]
The AI converts shapes into steps, but you'll need to manually set up rules (like conditional logic or [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/)) after importing.
:::

:::tip[Get better results]
Use clear, high-resolution flowchart images. Readable text and distinct shapes help the AI convert steps correctly.

### Copying templates between accounts

Copy a template from one Tallyfy account to another using two IDs.

#### What you need
- Login access to both accounts (source and destination)
- Administrator permissions in the destination account

#### Step 1: Get IDs from source account
<Steps>
1. In the source account, open the template you want to copy
2. Click **Settings** > **Export**
3. Copy the **Organization ID** and **Template ID** shown
   ![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-configure-template-tools.png)
</Steps>

#### Step 2: Import into destination account
<Steps>
1. Log into the destination account
2. Go to **Settings** > **[Integrations](/products/pro/integrations/)** > **Import and Export**
3. Paste the **Organization ID** and **Template ID** from the source account
4. Click **Import**
5. Verify the imported template looks correct
   ![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/Import%20Template.png)
</Steps>

#### Common reasons for copying templates
- Consultants moving templates to a client's account
- Sharing standard processes between departments or branches
- Copying templates between a test account and production

### API import and export

The Tallyfy API lets you manage templates programmatically - useful for bulk operations or custom integrations.

- Export templates as JSON (good for backups)
- Import templates from JSON for bulk operations
- Script template creation and management

See the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tallyfy/api-support/) for code examples and details.

### Best practices for Word and PowerPoint imports

- **Purpose**: Tallyfy creates online workflows, not print-ready documents. It's built for doing, not filing.
- **Formatting**: Fancy Word formatting gets stripped on purpose. You'll reformat using Tallyfy's tools - it's better this way.
- **Structure**: Use headings (H1, H2, H3) to organize content. Tallyfy builds a clickable table of contents from them automatically.
- **Branding**: Your company branding gets applied automatically across all templates.
- **Images**: Pictures from Office files might need resizing after import.
- **Versions**: Tallyfy keeps one [master template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/master-templates-vs-processes/) with a full history log - no more "v2_final_FINAL" file names.
- **Dynamic content**: Multiple PowerPoint versions become one template with smart branching via conditional logic

:::tip[Best practice]
Get your text content from Word into Tallyfy first - then use Tallyfy's features to format and structure it.
