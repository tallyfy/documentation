## Template import options

Tallyfy provides multiple ways to import templates into your organization, allowing for efficient knowledge transfer and standardization across teams.

### AI document import (Coming soon)

Tallyfy is developing a feature that automatically converts existing standard operating procedure (SOP) documents into interactive templates:

- Upload Word, PDF, or other document formats
- AI analyzes document structure and content
- System creates a template based on the document's steps and instructions
- Review and refine the generated template before use

This feature will be available in an upcoming release.

### Copy templates between organizations

Transferring templates between Tallyfy organizations requires both the source organization ID and template ID.

#### Prerequisites
- Access to both source and target organizations
- Administrator permissions in the target organization

#### Exporting a template
1. Navigate to the template you want to export
2. Click **Settings** > **Export**
3. Note the displayed **Organization ID** and **Template ID**
