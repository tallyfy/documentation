## What import options does Tallyfy provide for bringing templates into your account?

Tallyfy offers multiple sophisticated methods for importing templates into your account, facilitating seamless process sharing and document conversion capabilities across different formats.

These diverse import options accommodate various source formats and organizational needs, enabling efficient template migration and workflow standardization across teams and systems.

This flexibility ensures you can leverage existing documentation while transitioning to Tallyfy's digital workflow platform.

:::note[Who can import templates?]
Only "Standard" [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) (if allowed by an Admin) or "Administrator" members can import templates. "Light" members cannot.

### How can AI convert my existing documents to Tallyfy templates?

Tallyfy AI provides intelligent document conversion capabilities that automatically transform existing procedure documentation including SOPs into fully functional Tallyfy templates.

This AI-powered conversion process analyzes document structure and content to create optimized workflow templates that maintain the essential information while improving digital usability:

- Upload your file (Word, PDF, etc.).
- The AI reads the document.
- Choose the output type:
  - **Document**: Creates a simple Tallyfy document, cleaning up the formatting.
  - **Procedure**: Tries to create a step-by-step Tallyfy process template.
- Review the template Tallyfy creates and make any needed changes.

:::note[Non-exact Import (Default)]
This AI conversion is **non-exact**. The AI analyzes the document and may modify content, formatting, or structure to create an optimized Tallyfy template. It prioritizes creating a functional Tallyfy process over making an exact replica of your source file.

For situations requiring a verbatim copy of your source document (e.g., for compliance), see the [Exact import via AI (Manual HTML conversion)](/products/pro/documenting/templates/create-template/#exact-import-via-ai-manual-html-conversion) method described in the *Create a template* article.

### How can AI convert flowcharts to functional templates?

Tallyfy AI can also convert flowchart images into Tallyfy templates, transforming visual process diagrams into executable workflows:

- Upload a clear picture of the flowchart (PNG, JPG) or a PDF.
- The AI looks at the shapes and text.
- Choose the output type:
  - **Document**: Creates a simplified Tallyfy document.
  - **Procedure**: Turns the flowchart shapes into steps in a Tallyfy template.
- Review the result and make changes as needed.

:::note[Manual setup needed for rules]
The AI mainly converts the shapes into steps. You will need to manually set up any rules (like conditional logic or [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/)) after importing.
:::

:::tip[Get better results]
Use clear, high-resolution flowchart images. Easy-to-read text and clear shapes help the AI understand the steps correctly.

### How can I copy templates between different Tallyfy accounts?

You can copy a template from one Tallyfy organization (account) to another for sharing or migration purposes. You'll need the ID numbers for the original organization and the template to complete this process.

#### What prerequisites are needed to copy templates between accounts?
- Access to log into both Tallyfy accounts (the source and the destination) with appropriate credentials.
- Administrator permission in the account you are importing into for security and access control.

#### Step 1: How can I obtain the necessary IDs from the source account?
<Steps>
1. In the source account, open the template you want to copy.
2. Click **Settings** > **Export**.
3. Copy down the **Organization ID** and **Template ID** shown.

</Steps>

#### Step 2: How can I import the template into the destination account?
<Steps>
1. Log into the destination account (where you want the copy).
2. Go to **Settings** > **[Integrations](/products/pro/integrations/)** > **Import and Export**.
3. Enter the **Organization ID** and **Template ID** you copied from the source account.
4. Click **Import**.
5. Check the imported template to make sure it looks right.

</Steps>

#### What are common business reasons to copy templates between accounts?
- Consultants moving templates to a client's account for project delivery.
- Sharing standard processes between different departments or company branches for consistency.
- Copying templates between a test account and a live production account for safe deployment.

### How can I import and export templates using the API for automation?

For developers or large-scale tasks, you can manage templates programmatically using code via the Tallyfy API:

- Export templates as JSON files (for backup or migration purposes).
- Import templates from JSON files for bulk operations.
- Build scripts to automate template creation or management for efficiency.

This programmatic approach enables sophisticated template management workflows for enterprise use cases.

See our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tallyfy/api-support/) for code examples and technical details.

### What are best practices for importing from Word documents?

If you copy/paste from Microsoft Word or use the AI document import for Word files, keep these considerations in mind:

- **Purpose**: Tallyfy templates are designed for online use, not perfect print replicas, optimizing for digital workflow execution.
- **Formatting**: Tallyfy intentionally removes most Word formatting when you paste or import to maintain consistency. Use Tallyfy's formatting tools after importing for proper styling.
- **Structure**: Use Tallyfy's Headings (H1, H2, H3) to structure content and automatically create a table of contents for navigation.
- **Branding**: Tallyfy applies your company's branding automatically; you don't format each document manually, ensuring consistency.
- **Images**: Images copied from Word might need resizing in Tallyfy for optimal display.
- **Versions**: Tallyfy maintains one main version with a history log, unlike Word where you might have many separate files.

These differences reflect Tallyfy's focus on collaborative, digital workflow execution rather than static document management.

:::tip[Best practice]
Focus on getting the text content from Word into Tallyfy first. Then use Tallyfy's features to format and structure it.
