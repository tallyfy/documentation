## Template import options

Tallyfy provides multiple ways to import templates into your organization, allowing for efficient knowledge transfer and standardization across teams.

### AI-driven document import

Tallyfy is developing a feature that automatically converts existing standard operating procedure (SOP) documents into interactive templates:

- Upload Word, PDF, or other document formats
- AI analyzes document structure and content
- System creates a template based on the document's steps and instructions
- Review and refine the generated template before use

This feature will be available in an upcoming release.

### Import a flowchart

Tallyfy's AI can also convert existing flowcharts into interactive templates:

- Upload high-resolution flowchart images (PNG, JPG) or PDF files
- AI analyzes and recognizes shapes, blocks, and text in the flowchart
- System automatically converts flowchart elements into sequential steps
- Review and refine the generated template before use

:::note[Manual automation setup]
While Tallyfy extracts steps from flowcharts automatically, branches and automation rules need to be set up manually after import. The AI focuses on converting visual elements into steps but doesn't currently interpret conditional logic from the flowchart.
:::

:::tip[Best results]
For optimal recognition accuracy, use high-resolution flowchart images. Clear text, distinct shapes, and well-defined connections help the AI correctly identify and extract all steps in the proper sequence.

### Copy templates between organizations

Transferring templates between Tallyfy organizations requires both the source organization ID and template ID.

- Administrator permissions in the target organization

#### Exporting a template
1. Navigate to the template you want to export
2. Click **Settings** > **Export**
3. Note the displayed **Organization ID** and **Template ID**

### Common use cases
- Consultants transferring templates to client organizations
- Standardizing processes across multiple company entities

- Backing up templates between development and production environments

### API-based import and export

For advanced users or bulk operations, Tallyfy offers API-based template management:

#### Export via API
- Export templates in JSON format
- Store exported templates for backup or archival
- Include all template components, including steps, fields, and configurations

#### Import via API
- Create templates programmatically
- Import previously exported templates
- Automate template creation across multiple organizations

### Considerations when importing from Word documents

When copying and pasting content from Microsoft Word or importing Word documents into Tallyfy, keep these differences in mind:

- **Document purpose**: Tallyfy templates are designed primarily for digital reading rather than printing, though you can still print them if needed.

- **Formatting sanitization**: When you copy and paste content from Word, Tallyfy will automatically strip formatting. This is intentional as Word often adds custom styling and formatting that can affect performance and consistency.

- **Content structure**: Use semantic headings (H2, H3) in Tallyfy to automatically build a table of contents for better navigation.

- **Branding and styling**: Tallyfy offers a global brand styling feature that automatically applies your company's branding to all templates, eliminating the need to manually format individual documents.

- **Image handling**: When copying images from Word, you may encounter sizing issues. Tallyfy allows you to customize image sizing, but the process differs from Word.

- **Version management**: Unlike Word's version history, Tallyfy maintains a single latest version of each template with a comprehensive audit trail of all changes.

:::tip[Best practice]
For best results when moving content from Word to Tallyfy, focus on transferring the core content rather than trying to preserve exact formatting. Use Tallyfy's built-in formatting tools to apply consistent styling after import.
