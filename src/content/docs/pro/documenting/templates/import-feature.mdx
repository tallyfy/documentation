## Import a document via AI

Tallyfy is developing a feature that will allow you to import existing SOP documents to create templates automatically using your document as a foundation.

## Copy a Tallyfy template between organizations

To copy a template between organizations, you need both the **Organization ID** and **Template ID**.

To retrieve these IDs:
1. Navigate to the template you want to export
2. Click **Settings** > **Export**

![Export template settings](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-configure-template-tools.png)

The page displays both your **Org ID** and **Template ID**. Share these values with the target organization to enable them to import your template.

This feature is particularly useful for consultants or third parties who build templates in one organization and need to transfer them to client organizations.

To import a template from another organization:
1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Import and Export**
2. Enter the source **Org ID** and **Template ID**
3. Complete the import process

## Import and export via API

Tallyfy offers API capabilities for template management:

* **Export templates**: Export templates in JSON format via the API for storage or archival purposes
* **Import templates**: Import previously saved templates using the API with properly formatted requests

Open-source scripts for these operations are available in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tallyfy/api-support).
