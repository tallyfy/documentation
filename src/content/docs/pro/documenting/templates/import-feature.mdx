## Import a document via AI

We are currently working on a feature that lets you import your existing SOP or similar document so that a template can be created for you a lot more easily using your document as a foundation.

## Copy a Tallyfy template between two organizations

You'll first need to get your **Organization ID** but most importantly, the **Template ID**.

You can get this by going heading to the template you want to export and clicking on **Settings** > **Export**.

I You'll see your **Org ID** as well as the **Template ID**. If you want to copy this template to another organization - you can give them these two values, and they will be able to import it into their own organization.

Sometimes, consultants or third-parties use it to build a template in one organization called OrgA - but then copy over the template to another organization - OrgB.

For the organization planning to import the template, please navigate to Settings > Integrations > Import and Export, and utilize the **Org ID** and **Template ID**.

## Import and export via API

In terms of importing and exporting templates from Tallyfy - you can export them in JSON via our API to store or archive. There's open source scripts for this in our GitHub [open source repo](https://github.com/tallyfy/api-support).

You can also import a template you may have saved, but you need to use our API and format the request to create the template correctly to re-create it.
