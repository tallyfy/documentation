## Options for importing templates

Tallyfy gives you several ways to bring templates into your account, making it easy to share processes or convert existing documents.

:::note[Who can import templates?]
Only "Standard" [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) (if allowed by an Admin) or "Administrator" members can import templates. "Light" members cannot.
:::

### Let AI convert your documents (Word, PDF)

Tallyfy AI can automatically turn your existing procedure documents (like SOPs) into usable Tallyfy templates:

- Upload your file (Word, PDF, etc.).
- The AI reads the document.
- Choose the output type:
  - **Document**: Creates a simple Tallyfy document, cleaning up the formatting.
  - **Procedure**: Tries to create a step-by-step Tallyfy process template.
- Review the template Tallyfy creates and make any needed changes.

:::note[Non-exact Import (Default)]
This AI conversion is **non-exact**. The AI analyzes the document and may modify content, formatting, or structure to create an optimized Tallyfy template. It prioritizes creating a functional Tallyfy process over making an exact replica of your source file.

For situations requiring a verbatim copy of your source document (e.g., for compliance), see the [Exact import via AI (Manual HTML conversion)](/products/pro/documenting/templates/create-template/#exact-import-via-ai-manual-html-conversion) method described in the *Create a template* article.
:::

### Let AI convert your flowcharts

Tallyfy AI can also try to turn flowchart images into Tallyfy [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/):

- Upload a clear picture of the flowchart (PNG, JPG) or a PDF.
- The AI looks at the shapes and text.
- Choose the output type:
  - **Document**: Creates a simplified Tallyfy document.
  - **Procedure**: Turns the flowchart shapes into steps in a Tallyfy template.
- Review the result and make changes as needed.

:::note[Manual setup needed for rules]
The AI mainly converts the shapes into steps. You will need to manually set up any rules (like conditional logic or [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/)) after importing.
:::

:::tip[Get better results]
Use clear, high-resolution flowchart images. Easy-to-read text and clear shapes help the AI understand the steps correctly.

### Copy Templates between Tallyfy accounts

You can copy a template from one Tallyfy organization (account) to another. You'll need the ID numbers for the original organization and the template.

#### What you need
- Access to log into both Tallyfy accounts (the source and the destination).
- Administrator permission in the account you are importing *into*.

#### Step 1: Get IDs from the source account
<Steps>
1. In the source account, open the template you want to copy.
2. Click **Settings** > **Export**.
3. Copy down the **Organization ID** and **Template ID** shown.

</Steps>

#### Step 2: Import into the destination account
<Steps>
1. Log into the destination account (where you want the copy).
2. Go to **Settings** > **[Integrations](/products/pro/integrations/)** > **Import and Export**.
3. Enter the **Organization ID** and **Template ID** you copied from the source account.
4. Click **Import**.
5. Check the imported template to make sure it looks right.

</Steps>

#### Common reasons to copy templates
- Consultants moving templates to a client's account.
- Sharing standard processes between different departments or company branches.
- Copying templates between a test account and a live production account.

### Import and export using the API (Advanced)

For developers or large-scale tasks, you can manage templates using code via the Tallyfy [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/):

- Export templates as JSON files (for backup or moving).
- Import templates from JSON files.
- Build scripts to automate template creation or management.

See our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tallyfy/api-support/) for code examples and technical details.

### Tips when importing from Word documents

If you copy/paste from Microsoft Word or use the AI document import for Word files, remember:

- **Purpose**: Tallyfy templates are mainly for online use, not perfect print replicas.
- **Formatting**: Tallyfy *intentionally removes* most Word formatting when you paste or import. This keeps things consistent. Use Tallyfy's formatting tools after importing.
- **Structure**: Use Tallyfy's Headings (H1, H2, H3) to structure content and automatically create a table of contents.
- **Branding**: Tallyfy applies your company's branding automatically; you don't format each document manually.
- **Images**: Images copied from Word might need resizing in Tallyfy.
- **Versions**: Tallyfy keeps one main version with a history log, unlike Word where you might have many separate files.

:::tip[Best practice]
Focus on getting the text content from Word into Tallyfy first. Then use Tallyfy's features to format and structure it.
