## Understanding snippets in Tallyfy

Snippets are reusable blocks of content that can be inserted across multiple [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) and [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), creating consistency and saving time.

### What are snippets?

Snippets are predefined text segments that can contain:
- Standard paragraphs
- Compliance language
- Instructions
- Definitions
- Policies
- Procedures
- Disclaimers
- Any frequently repeated content

### Key benefits of using snippets

- **Consistency** - Maintain uniform language across all processes
- **Efficiency** - Create content once and reuse it multiple times
- **Maintenance** - Update content in one place to affect all instances
- **Standardization** - Ensure everyone uses approved language
- **Time savings** - Eliminate repetitive typing of common text

### How snippets work

1. **Create** a snippet with standardized text
2. **Insert** the snippet into [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), or [documents](/products/pro/documenting/documents/)
3. **Update** the snippet content when needed (changes apply everywhere)
4. **Manage** your snippet library for organization-wide use

### Common snippet use cases

- Legal disclaimers in documents
- Standard operating procedures
- Company policy statements
- Instructions that appear in multiple [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)
- Common definitions
- Frequently used explanations
- Form instructions
- Contact information
