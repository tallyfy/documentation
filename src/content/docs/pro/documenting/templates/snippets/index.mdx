## What are snippets?

Snippets are reusable text blocks in Tallyfy. Save them once, insert them anywhere - templates, tasks, comments. When you update a snippet, every place that uses it gets the new version automatically.

Tired of typing the same compliance disclaimer repeatedly? Create a snippet. Done.

:::tip[Snippets = rubber stamps]
Think of a snippet as a **rubber stamp** with your company address or legal notice. Instead of typing it each time, you "stamp" it where needed. If the address changes, update the stamp once - the change shows up everywhere you've used it.

### What snippets can contain

Snippets hold rich text content - anything you'd normally type in the editor:
- Standard instructions for common procedures
- Company policies referenced across multiple templates
- Legal disclaimers
- Technical terms that need exact wording
- Contact information that changes periodically

:::important[What snippets can't do]
**Snippets are text-only.** They can't contain:
- **Form fields** (checkboxes, dropdowns, date pickers)
- **Task structures** (assignees, deadlines, dependencies)
- **Interactive elements** or **conditional logic**

If you need reusable tasks with form fields, create a master template and copy tasks from it to other templates manually.
:::

### Why use snippets?

- **Consistency** - your legal disclaimer stays identical across every document
- **One-time updates** - change one snippet, and it updates across all templates and steps that reference it
- **Admin control** - only Admin members can create, edit, and delete snippets, so your approved text stays approved

### How the snippet workflow works

1. **Create** - an Admin goes to **Settings > Organization > Snippets** and creates a new snippet with a title and rich text content
2. **Insert** - any member opens the editor in a template or task description and inserts the snippet from the reference panel
3. **Update** - an Admin edits the snippet later, and every place that references it shows the updated content automatically
4. **Delete** - when an Admin deletes a snippet, Tallyfy also removes its references from all templates and steps

### Where snippets work best

- Legal notes in contracts and process templates
- Standard operating procedures shared across workflows
- Company policy reminders
- Technical definitions requiring exact wording
- Contact info that changes when people move roles
- Form-filling instructions for recurring tasks
