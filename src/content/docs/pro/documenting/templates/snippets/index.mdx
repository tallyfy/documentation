## Understanding snippets in Tallyfy

Snippets are reusable blocks of content that can be inserted across multiple [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) and [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), creating consistency and saving time.

:::tip[Think of Snippets like Rubber Stamps or Standard Ingredients]
Imagine you have standard text you need to use frequently, like your company's contact address or a legal disclaimer.

A **snippet** works like a **rubber stamp** for that text. You create the stamp (the snippet) once with the correct information. Then, whenever you need that text in a template or task, you simply "stamp" it by inserting the snippet.

The real power comes with updates: if your company address changes, you update the *snippet* (the stamp) in one central place. That change automatically reflects everywhere you've used that snippet â€“ no need to find and edit every single instance manually!

Another way to think about it is like a **standard ingredient** in a kitchen. You prepare a common sauce or spice mix (the snippet) once. Then, you can easily add that prepared ingredient to many different recipes (templates). If you improve the sauce recipe, all dishes using it automatically get the benefit of the update.

### What are snippets?

Snippets are predefined text segments that can contain:
- Standard paragraphs
- Compliance language
- Instructions
- Definitions
- Policies
- Procedures
- Disclaimers
- Any frequently repeated content

### Key benefits of using snippets

- **Consistency** - Maintain uniform language across all processes
- **Efficiency** - Create content once and reuse it multiple times
- **Maintenance** - Update content in one place to affect all instances
- **Standardization** - Ensure everyone uses approved language
- **Time savings** - Eliminate repetitive typing of common text

### How snippets work

1. **Create** a snippet with standardized text
2. **Insert** the snippet into [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), or [documents](/products/pro/documenting/documents/)
3. **Update** the snippet content when needed (changes apply everywhere)
4. **Manage** your snippet library for organization-wide use

### Common snippet use cases

- Legal disclaimers in documents
- Standard operating procedures
- Company policy statements
- Instructions that appear in multiple [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)
- Common definitions
- Frequently used explanations
- Form instructions
- Contact information
