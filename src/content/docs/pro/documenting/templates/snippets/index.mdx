## Understanding snippets

Snippets are reusable text blocks in Tallyfy - save them once, use them everywhere. They're perfect for content you type repeatedly, like company addresses, legal disclaimers, or standard instructions. When you update a snippet, it automatically updates everywhere you've used it.

Think of it this way: you're tired of typing the same compliance disclaimer 50 times a week. Create a snippet. Done.

:::tip[Snippets = Rubber Stamps or Standard Ingredients]
Think of snippets in these ways:

- **Rubber Stamp:** Imagine you often need to write your company address or a legal note. A snippet in Tallyfy is like creating a **rubber stamp** with that text. Instead of typing it every time, you just "stamp" the snippet where you need it.

  *The big advantage:* If the address changes, you update the snippet (the stamp) once. The change automatically shows up everywhere you used that stamp!

- **Standard Ingredient:** Think of a common sauce or spice mix you use in many recipes. You prepare it once (create the snippet). Then, you easily add it to different recipes (templates or tasks). If you improve the sauce recipe, all dishes using it get the better version automatically.

### Content you can include in snippets

What can you actually put in a snippet? Pretty much any text you're sick of typing over and over:
- Standard instructions for common procedures
- Company policies that pop up in multiple documents
- Legal disclaimers (we all have them)
- Technical terms or company-specific jargon that needs exact wording
- Any text you've typed more than three times this week

:::important[What snippets cannot do]
**Snippets are text blocks only**. They cannot contain:
- **Form fields** (checkboxes, dropdowns, date pickers, etc.)
- **Task structures** (assignees, deadlines, dependencies)
- **Interactive elements** (buttons, links that change behavior)
- **Conditional logic** (if-then rules, automation triggers)

If you need reusable tasks with form fields, create a master template and copy tasks from it to other templates manually. For annually updated content like strategic objectives, include the text via snippet but ask users to specify responses in regular text areas.

### Benefits of using snippets

Why bother with snippets? Here's what you get:

- **Consistency**: Your legal disclaimer stays exactly the same across 100 documents. No more "wait, did Sarah word this differently?"
- **Efficiency**: Type it once. Use it everywhere. That's it.
- **Easy Updates**: Company address changed? Update one snippet - not 47 different templates
- **Standardization**: Everyone uses the approved text (yes, even Bob from accounting)
- **Save Time**: Stop typing the same thing repeatedly - the time savings add up quickly

### How snippet workflow works

1. **Create** a snippet with the text you want to reuse (admins usually handle this part - keeps things tidy)
2. **Insert** the snippet anywhere using the snippet tool (✂️ icon). It's right there in your editor
3. **Update** the snippet later if needed. Change it once, and boom - it updates everywhere automatically
4. **Manage** your snippet library. Admins can clean up old ones nobody uses anymore

### Best places to use snippets

Where do snippets really shine? Let me show you:

- Legal notes in contracts - get that compliance wording exactly right every time
- Standard operating procedures that show up in multiple workflows (you know the ones)
- Company policy reminders. Same message, everywhere
- Instructions that appear in different processes - why rewrite them?
- Technical definitions that can't be "close enough" 
- Those FAQs your team asks constantly. Put the answer in a snippet
- Form-filling instructions (because nobody reads them the first time anyway)
- Contact info that changes every time someone gets promoted
- Template references - when you need to link one template inside another, snippets make it clean

Pro tip: If you've explained something twice this month, it probably needs to be a snippet.
