## Understanding snippets in Tallyfy

Snippets are blocks of text you can save and reuse in many different places, like in your [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) or running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). Using snippets helps keep information consistent and saves you time.

:::tip[Snippets = Rubber Stamps or Standard Ingredients]
Think of snippets in these ways:

- **Rubber Stamp:** Imagine you often need to write your company address or a legal note. A snippet is like creating a **rubber stamp** with that text. Instead of typing it every time, you just "stamp" the snippet where you need it.

  *The big advantage:* If the address changes, you update the snippet (the stamp) once. The change automatically shows up everywhere you used that stamp!

- **Standard Ingredient:** Think of a common sauce or spice mix you use in many recipes. You prepare it once (create the snippet). Then, you easily add it to different recipes (templates or tasks). If you improve the sauce recipe, all dishes using it get the better version automatically.

### What can be in a snippet?

Snippets are predefined pieces of text that can include things like:
- Standard instructions or explanations.
- Company policies or compliance text.
- Legal disclaimers.
- Definitions.
- Any text you find yourself typing repeatedly.

### Why use snippets?

- **Consistency**: Keep wording the same everywhere.
- **Efficiency**: Write it once, use it many times.
- **Easy Updates**: Change the text in one place (the snippet), and it updates everywhere it's used.
- **Standardization**: Ensure everyone uses the correct, approved text.
- **Save Time**: Less repetitive typing.

### How snippets work (basic steps)

1. **Create** a snippet with the text you want to reuse (usually done by Admins).
2. **Insert** the snippet into template descriptions, task comments, etc., using the snippet tool (✂️ icon).
3. **Update** the snippet's content later if needed; the changes apply everywhere automatically.
4. **Manage** the list of snippets (Admins can organize and delete unused ones).

### Common places to use snippets

- Legal notes in contracts or documents.
- Standard operating procedure steps.
- Company policy reminders.
- Instructions that appear in multiple processes.
- Definitions of terms.
- Frequently asked questions or explanations.
- Instructions for filling out forms.
- Contact information.
