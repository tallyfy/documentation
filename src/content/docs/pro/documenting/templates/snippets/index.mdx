## Understanding snippets

Snippets are blocks of text you can save and reuse in many different places, like in your templates or running processes. Using snippets helps keep information consistent and saves you time by eliminating repetitive typing of common content.

Snippets provide centralized content management that ensures consistency while cutting down time spent creating similar content.

:::tip[Snippets = Rubber Stamps or Standard Ingredients]
Think of snippets in these ways:

- **Rubber Stamp:** Imagine you often need to write your company address or a legal note. A snippet is like creating a **rubber stamp** with that text. Instead of typing it every time, you just "stamp" the snippet where you need it.

  *The big advantage:* If the address changes, you update the snippet (the stamp) once. The change automatically shows up everywhere you used that stamp!

- **Standard Ingredient:** Think of a common sauce or spice mix you use in many recipes. You prepare it once (create the snippet). Then, you easily add it to different recipes (templates or tasks). If you improve the sauce recipe, all dishes using it get the better version automatically.

### Content you can include in snippets

Snippets are predefined pieces of text that can include various types of standardized content:
- Standard instructions or explanations for common procedures.
- Company policies or compliance text that appears across multiple documents.
- Legal disclaimers required for regulatory compliance.
- Definitions of technical terms or company-specific terminology.
- Any text you find yourself typing repeatedly across workflows.

This flexibility lets snippets serve diverse content standardization needs across your organization.

### Benefits of using snippets

- **Consistency**: Keep wording the same everywhere, eliminating variations in critical messaging.
- **Efficiency**: Write it once, use it many times across multiple templates and processes.
- **Easy Updates**: Change the text in one place (the snippet), and it updates everywhere it's used automatically.
- **Standardization**: Ensure everyone uses the correct, approved text without manual oversight.
- **Save Time**: Reduce repetitive typing and content creation overhead significantly.

These benefits grow as your organization creates more templates and processes with shared elements.

### How snippet workflow works

1. **Create** a snippet with the text you want to reuse (usually done by Admins for quality control).
2. **Insert** the snippet into template descriptions, task comments, etc., using the snippet tool (✂️ icon) for easy access.
3. **Update** the snippet's content later if needed; the changes apply everywhere automatically without manual propagation.
4. **Manage** the list of snippets (Admins can organize and delete unused ones) to maintain a clean, useful snippet library.

This workflow ensures centralized control while giving distributed access to standardized content.

### Best places to use snippets

- Legal notes in contracts or documents that require consistent wording for compliance.
- Standard operating procedure steps that appear across multiple workflows.
- Company policy reminders that need to be consistently communicated.
- Instructions that appear in multiple processes to ensure uniform guidance.
- Definitions of terms that require precise, standardized explanations.
- Frequently asked questions or explanations that team members commonly need.
- Instructions for filling out forms that should be identical across all instances.
- Contact information that may change but needs to be current everywhere.

These use cases maximize snippet value by targeting content that benefits most from standardization and centralized updates.
