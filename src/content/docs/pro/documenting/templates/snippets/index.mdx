## Understanding descriptions in Tallyfy

descriptions are blocks of text you can save and reuse in many different places, like in your [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) or running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). Using descriptions helps keep information consistent and saves you time.

:::tip[descriptions = Rubber Stamps or Standard Ingredients]
Think of descriptions in these ways:

- **Rubber Stamp:** Imagine you often need to write your company address or a legal note. A description is like creating a **rubber stamp** with that text. Instead of typing it every time, you just "stamp" the description where you need it.

  *The big advantage:* If the address changes, you update the description (the stamp) once. The change automatically shows up everywhere you used that stamp!

- **Standard Ingredient:** Think of a common sauce or spice mix you use in many recipes. You prepare it once (create the description). Then, you easily add it to different recipes (templates or tasks). If you improve the sauce recipe, all dishes using it get the better version automatically.

### What can be in a description?

descriptions are predefined pieces of text that can include things like:
- Standard instructions or explanations.
- Company policies or compliance text.
- Legal disclaimers.
- Definitions.
- Any text you find yourself typing repeatedly.

### Why use descriptions?

- **Consistency**: Keep wording the same everywhere.
- **Efficiency**: Write it once, use it many times.
- **Easy Updates**: Change the text in one place (the description), and it updates everywhere it's used.
- **Standardization**: Ensure everyone uses the correct, approved text.
- **Save Time**: Less repetitive typing.

### How descriptions work (basic steps)

1. **Create** a description with the text you want to reuse (usually done by Admins).
2. **Insert** the description into template descriptions, task comments, etc., using the description tool (✂️ icon).
3. **Update** the description's content later if needed; the changes apply everywhere automatically.
4. **Manage** the list of descriptions (Admins can organize and delete unused ones).

### Common places to use descriptions

- Legal notes in contracts or documents.
- Standard operating procedure steps.
- Company policy reminders.
- Instructions that appear in multiple processes.
- Definitions of terms.
- Frequently asked questions or explanations.
- Instructions for filling out forms.
- Contact information.
