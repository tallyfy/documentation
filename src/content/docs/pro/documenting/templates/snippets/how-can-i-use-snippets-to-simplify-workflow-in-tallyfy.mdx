## Creating and using snippets

Snippets are reusable text blocks you create once and insert anywhere - [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) steps, [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) descriptions, comments, and [documents](/products/pro/documenting/documents/). Open the **References** panel in any rich text editor and select the snippet you want.

Think compliance disclaimers, contact info, or standard instructions. Write it once, reuse it everywhere.

### Who can create and manage snippets?
- **Admin** members can create, edit, and delete snippets for the whole organization
- **All other members** can insert existing snippets wherever they're editing rich text

### Creating snippets (Admin only)

<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Snippets**.
2. Click **Create Snippet**.
3. Enter a clear, descriptive **Title**.
4. Type or paste content into the rich text editor.
5. Use the formatting toolbar (bold, italic, lists, links, images, tables, etc.) as needed.
6. Click **Save Changes**.
</Steps>

### Managing existing snippets (Admin only)

On the Snippets settings page, you can:
- View all snippets in a searchable, sortable table
- Edit any snippet - changes appear when content is next viewed[^1]
- Delete outdated snippets
- Control whether a snippet is visible in public templates via the **Visible in Public Templates** checkbox

### Inserting snippets into text

<Steps>
1. Click where you want the snippet text to appear in the editor.
2. Open the **References** panel below the editor.
3. Expand the **Snippets** section.
4. Click the snippet you want. It's inserted as a named reference block.
</Steps>

### Where can I use snippets?

Anywhere you see Tallyfy's rich text editor:

- Template descriptions and step descriptions
- Guidance text for [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/)
- Launch instructions shown before starting a process
- Task comments
- [Document template](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) content

### Embedding template references

You can also link to entire templates from the same References panel. Useful when your workflow mentions another process - embed a reference instead of copying content.

<Steps>
1. Click where you want the template reference.
2. Open the **References** panel.
3. Expand the **Templates** section.
4. Select the template you want to link to.
</Steps>

### Tips for snippets

**Name them descriptively.** "Legal disclaimer for contracts" beats "Legal text 1."

**Keep them focused.** A three-paragraph warranty disclaimer works. An entire employee handbook doesn't.

**Single source of truth.** If a support phone number appears in 12 processes, make it a snippet. Update once.

**Review periodically.** Check quarterly that snippets remain current and relevant.
