## Creating and using snippets

Snippets allow you to store and reuse text content across templates, [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), and descriptions, eliminating redundancy and ensuring consistency.

### Requirements
- Administrator access (to create organization-wide snippets)
- Access to a template, [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), or task where you want to use snippets

### Creating snippets

<Steps>
1. Navigate to **Account Settings > Organization > Snippets**
2. Click **Create Snippet**
3. In the editor, enter:
   - A descriptive title for your snippet
   - The content you want to reuse
   - Any formatting required (bold, italics, lists, etc.)
4. Click **Save**
</Steps>

### Managing existing snippets

From the Snippets management screen, you can:
- View all available snippets
- Edit existing snippets (changes apply everywhere the snippet is used)
- Delete snippets that are no longer needed
- Create categories to organize snippets by purpose or department

### Inserting snippets

Snippets can be inserted in various locations throughout Tallyfy:

<Steps>
1. Position your cursor where you want to insert the snippet
2. Click the **Scissors** icon in the text editor toolbar
3. Select the snippet you want to use from the dropdown menu
4. The snippet content will be inserted at the cursor position
</Steps>

### Locations where snippets can be used

Snippets can be inserted in multiple areas of Tallyfy:

#### In Templates
- Template descriptions
- Step descriptions
- [Form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) instructions
- Process instructions

#### In active Processes
- Task comments
- Process notes
- Client communications

#### In Documents
- [Document template](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) content
- Standardized legal text
- Instructions and guidance

### Embedding Templates as snippets

For more complex reuse, you can embed entire templates within other templates:

<Steps>
1. Position your cursor where you want to embed the template
2. Click the **Scissors** icon
3. Select the **Templates** option from the dropdown
4. Choose the template you want to embed
5. The embedded template will appear as a linked reference
</Steps>

### Best practices for snippets

- **Create a naming convention** for snippets to make them easy to find
- **Keep snippets modular** rather than creating very large blocks of text
- **Update snippets centrally** when information changes
- **Use categories** to organize snippets by department or purpose
- **Review snippets periodically** to ensure information remains current
