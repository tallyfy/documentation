## How can I create and use snippets?

Snippets in Tallyfy are reusable blocks of text. You create them once and then insert them into multiple places like [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) steps, [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) descriptions, or comments. This saves you from typing the same thing over and over and keeps your information consistent.

### Who can create and manage snippets?
- Only **Administrators** in Tallyfy can create, edit, and delete the main list of shared snippets for the whole organization.
- Any member can *insert* existing snippets into places they can edit (like task descriptions or comments).

### How do I create snippets? (Admins only)

<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Snippets** (Note: This path might vary slightly; look for Snippets under Organization settings).
2. Click **Create Snippet**.
3. Give the snippet a clear, descriptive **Title** so you can find it easily later.
4. Type or paste the text **Content** you want to reuse into the main box.
5. Use the formatting tools (bold, lists, etc.) if needed.
6. Click **Save**.
</Steps>

### How do I manage existing snippets? (Admins only)

From the main Snippets settings page in Tallyfy, Admins can:
- See all the snippets created for the organization.
- Edit a snippet (click on it). Changes automatically update everywhere the snippet is used.
- Delete snippets that are no longer needed.
- Organize snippets into categories (like "HR Policies" or "Sales Emails").

### How do I insert snippets into text?

Anyone editing text in Tallyfy (like a task description or comment) can insert a snippet:

<Steps>
1. Click where you want the snippet text to appear.
2. Click the **Snippets** icon (looks like scissors ✂️) in the editor toolbar.
3. Choose the snippet you want from the list that appears.
4. The snippet's content will be inserted right where your cursor was.
</Steps>

### Where can I use snippets?

You can insert snippets almost anywhere you see the text editor toolbar in Tallyfy, including:

- Template descriptions and step descriptions.
- Guidance text for [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/).
- Special instructions shown before launching a process.
- Comments on running tasks.
- Notes added to processes.
- [Document template](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) content.

### How can I embed templates using snippets?

You can also insert a link to an *entire other template* using the snippet tool. This effectively lets you move a template inside another template by embedding template references within task descriptions. This is less common but can be used to reference related processes or link to standard procedures that teams should follow.

<Steps>
1. Click where you want the template link.
2. Click the **Snippets** icon (✂️).
3. Choose the **Templates** option.
4. Select the template you want to link to.
5. A link to that template will be inserted.
</Steps>

This template embedding approach is useful when you want to reference standard operating procedures, compliance checklists, or related workflows without duplicating content across multiple templates.

### What are tips for using snippets effectively?

- **Use clear names**: Give snippets titles that make it obvious what they contain.
- **Keep them focused**: Make snippets for specific pieces of information, not huge paragraphs.
- **Update in one place**: If information changes (like a phone number or policy), just edit the snippet once in Tallyfy, and it updates everywhere.
- **Organize with categories**: Use categories in the Snippets settings to group related snippets.
- **Review regularly**: Check your snippets in Tallyfy periodically to make sure they are still accurate.
