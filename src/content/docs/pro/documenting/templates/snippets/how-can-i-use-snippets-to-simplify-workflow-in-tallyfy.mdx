## How can I create and use snippets?

To use snippets in Tallyfy, click the **Snippets** icon (✂️) in any text editor and select the text block you want to insert. That's it. Snippets are reusable text blocks you create once and insert anywhere - [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) steps, [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) descriptions, comments, you name it.

Think of snippets like your personal copy-paste library, except smarter. You're not typing the same compliance disclaimer 50 times. You're not worrying if everyone's using the right phone number. Create it once, use it everywhere.

### Who can create and manage snippets?
- **Administrators** create, edit, and delete snippets for the whole organization
- **Everyone else** can insert existing snippets wherever they're editing text (like task descriptions or comments)

### How do I create snippets? (Admins only)

<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Snippets** (Note: This path might vary slightly; look for Snippets under Organization settings).
2. Click **Create Snippet**.
3. Give the snippet a clear, descriptive **Title** so you can find it easily later.
4. Type or paste the text **Content** you want to reuse into the main box.
5. Use the formatting tools (bold, lists, etc.) if needed.
6. Click **Save**.
</Steps>

### How do I manage existing snippets? (Admins only)

Once you're in the Snippets settings page, you'll see everything your organization has created. Need to update that office address that just changed? Click the snippet and edit it - boom, it updates everywhere. No more hunting through 47 different templates.

Here's what you can do:
- View all snippets at a glance
- Edit any snippet (changes update everywhere instantly)
- Delete outdated snippets
- Organize them into categories - "HR Policies", "Legal Disclaimers", "Contact Info", whatever makes sense for your team

### How do I insert snippets into text?

Any time you're editing text in Tallyfy - writing a comment, creating a task description, whatever - you can drop in a snippet:

<Steps>
1. Click where you want the snippet text to appear.
2. Click the **Snippets** icon (looks like scissors ✂️) in the editor toolbar.
3. Choose the snippet you want from the list that appears.
4. The snippet's content will be inserted right where your cursor was.
</Steps>

### Where can I use snippets?

Pretty much anywhere you see that text editor toolbar in Tallyfy, you can use snippets. We're talking:

- Template descriptions and step descriptions
- Guidance text for [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) (perfect for those "Please enter your employee ID in format XXX-XXX" instructions)
- Launch instructions - those special notes people see before starting a process
- Task comments when you're collaborating
- Process notes
- [Document template](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) content

If you can type there, you can probably snippet there.

### How can I embed templates using snippets?

Here's something cool - you can link to entire templates using the snippet tool. Instead of just text, you're embedding a reference to another whole template right inside a task description. 

Why would you do this? Let's say your main workflow mentions "Follow the IT Security Checklist here." Instead of copying that whole checklist, just embed a link to it. When that security checklist gets updated (because of course it will), your reference stays current.

<Steps>
1. Click where you want the template link.
2. Click the **Snippets** icon (✂️).
3. Choose the **Templates** option.
4. Select the template you want to link to.
5. A link to that template will be inserted.
</Steps>

Works great for standard operating procedures, compliance checklists, or any process that connects to other processes. No more maintaining the same info in multiple places.

### What are tips for using snippets effectively?

After helping hundreds of teams set up their snippet libraries, here's what actually works:

**Name them like you'll search for them.** "Legal disclaimer for contracts" beats "Legal text 1" every time. You'll thank yourself in six months when you can't remember what you called that GDPR notice.

**Keep them bite-sized.** A three-paragraph warranty disclaimer? Perfect snippet. Your entire employee handbook? That's pushing it. Snippets work best for chunks of text you use repeatedly - think email signatures, standard warnings, common instructions.

**One source of truth matters.** Got a support phone number that appears in 12 different processes? Make it a snippet. When your company switches phone systems (and you know it will), you'll update it once. Done.

**Categories are your friend.** Once you hit about 20 snippets, you'll want them organized. "Customer Communications", "Legal Requirements", "Technical Instructions" - whatever categories make sense for your team.

**Schedule snippet reviews.** Maybe quarterly, maybe twice a year - just check that your snippets still make sense. That COVID-19 safety protocol from 2020? Might be time to retire it.
