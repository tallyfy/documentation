## Creating and using snippets

To use snippets in Tallyfy, click the **Snippets** icon (✂️) in any text editor and select the text block you want to insert. Snippets are reusable text blocks you create once and insert anywhere - [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) steps, [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) descriptions, comments, and more.

You can use snippets to avoid typing the same compliance disclaimer 50 times or to ensure everyone uses the correct phone number.

### Who can create and manage snippets?
- **Administrators** create, edit, and delete snippets for the whole organization
- **Everyone else** can insert existing snippets wherever they're editing text (like task descriptions or comments)

### Creating snippets (Admins only)

<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Snippets** (Note: This path might vary slightly; look for Snippets under Organization settings).
2. Click **Create Snippet**.
3. Give the snippet a clear, descriptive **Title** so you can find it easily later.
4. Type or paste the text **Content** you want to reuse into the main box.
5. Use the formatting tools (bold, lists, etc.) if needed.
6. Click **Save**.
</Steps>

### Managing existing snippets (Admins only)

In the Snippets settings page, you can:
- View all snippets at a glance
- Edit any snippet (changes update everywhere instantly)
- Delete outdated snippets
- Organize them into categories - "HR Policies", "Legal Disclaimers", "Contact Info", whatever makes sense for your team

### Inserting snippets into text

When editing text in Tallyfy, insert a snippet by:

<Steps>
1. Click where you want the snippet text to appear.
2. Click the **Snippets** icon (looks like scissors ✂️) in the editor toolbar.
3. Choose the snippet you want from the list that appears.
4. The snippet's content will be inserted right where your cursor was.
</Steps>

### Where can I use snippets?

You can use snippets anywhere you see the text editor toolbar in Tallyfy:

- Template descriptions and step descriptions
- Guidance text for [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) (perfect for those "Please enter your employee ID in format XXX-XXX" instructions)
- Launch instructions - those special notes people see before starting a process
- Task comments when you're collaborating
- Process notes
- [Document template](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) content


### Embedding templates using snippets

You can link to entire templates using the snippet tool. For example, if your workflow mentions "Follow the IT Security Checklist here," embed a link to that template instead of copying its content. When the checklist updates, your reference stays current.

<Steps>
1. Click where you want the template link.
2. Click the **Snippets** icon (✂️).
3. Choose the **Templates** option.
4. Select the template you want to link to.
5. A link to that template will be inserted.
</Steps>

Use this for standard operating procedures, compliance checklists, or processes that connect to other processes.

### Tips for using snippets effectively


**Name snippets descriptively.** Use "Legal disclaimer for contracts" instead of "Legal text 1" to find them easily later.

**Keep snippets short.** A three-paragraph warranty disclaimer works well. An entire employee handbook doesn't.

**Create single sources of truth.** If a support phone number appears in 12 processes, make it a snippet. Update once when it changes.

**Organize with categories.** After 20+ snippets, organize them into categories like "Customer Communications", "Legal Requirements", or "Technical Instructions".

**Schedule reviews.** Check quarterly or biannually that snippets remain current and relevant.
