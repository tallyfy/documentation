## Creating and using descriptions

descriptions are reusable blocks of text. You create them once and then insert them into multiple places like [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) steps, [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) descriptions, or comments. This saves you from typing the same thing over and over and keeps your information consistent.

### Who can create/manage descriptions?
- Only **Administrators** can create, edit, and delete the main list of shared descriptions for the whole organization.
- Any member can *insert* existing descriptions into places they can edit (like task descriptions or comments).

### Creating descriptions (Admins only)

<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **descriptions** (Note: This path might vary slightly; look for descriptions under Organization settings).
2. Click **Create description**.
3. Give the description a clear, descriptive **Title** so you can find it easily later.
4. Type or paste the text **Content** you want to reuse into the main box.
5. Use the formatting tools (bold, lists, etc.) if needed.
6. Click **Save**.
</Steps>

### Managing existing descriptions (Admins only)

From the main descriptions settings page, Admins can:
- See all the descriptions created for the organization.
- Edit a description (click on it). Changes automatically update everywhere the description is used.
- Delete descriptions that are no longer needed.
- Organize descriptions into categories (like "HR Policies" or "Sales Emails").

### Inserting descriptions into text

Anyone editing text (like a task description or comment) can insert a description:

<Steps>
1. Click where you want the description text to appear.
2. Click the **descriptions** icon (looks like scissors ✂️) in the editor toolbar.
3. Choose the description you want from the list that appears.
4. The description's content will be inserted right where your cursor was.
</Steps>

### Where can you use descriptions?

You can insert descriptions almost anywhere you see the text editor toolbar, including:

- Template descriptions and step descriptions.
- Guidance text for [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/).
- Special instructions shown before launching a process.
- Comments on running tasks.
- Notes added to processes.
- [Document template](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) content.

### Embedding Templates (Advanced description Use)

You can also insert a link to an *entire other template* using the description tool. This is less common but can be used to reference related processes.

<Steps>
1. Click where you want the template link.
2. Click the **descriptions** icon (✂️).
3. Choose the **Templates** option.
4. Select the template you want to link to.
5. A link to that template will be inserted.
</Steps>

### Tips for using descriptions well

- **Use clear names**: Give descriptions titles that make it obvious what they contain.
- **Keep them focused**: Make descriptions for specific pieces of information, not huge paragraphs.
- **Update in one place**: If information changes (like a phone number or policy), just edit the description once, and it updates everywhere.
- **Organize with categories**: Use categories in the descriptions settings to group related descriptions.
- **Review regularly**: Check your descriptions sometimes to make sure they are still accurate.
