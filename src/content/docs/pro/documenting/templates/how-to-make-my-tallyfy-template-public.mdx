## Publishing templates publicly

To make a template public in Tallyfy, click **Edit** on your template, go to **Settings**, find **Public to the world**, and switch it to **yes**. Anyone can then view your template structure[^1] without logging in. You'll get a shareable link to send to clients, partners, or vendors.

### What you need

- Administrator or Standard member permissions (Light members can't edit templates)
- A template ready for public sharing

### Why publish a template?

- **Share with anyone** - give a direct link to view your process. No login or Tallyfy account needed
- **Show examples** - display your workflows to potential customers as proof of how you work
- **Provide documentation** - external teams can access process info instantly
- **Help others learn** - let people see how you've structured your processes

### Publishing a template

<Steps>
1. Go to the **Library** view where your templates are listed
2. Find the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) you want to publish
3. Click **Edit** to open the template editor
4. Click **Settings** (or **Config**) in the editor toolbar
5. Go to the **Permissions** tab
6. Find **Public to the world** and switch it to **yes**
7. Click **Save**
</Steps>

### After publishing

You'll get a shareable URL in the template settings. You can:
- Share this link anywhere - email, chat, website, social media
- Let people view the template structure without logging in

### Security and privacy

- **What's public?** Only the template structure - steps, descriptions, summary, guidance, and kickoff fields. Think of it like sharing a recipe without showing what you cooked last Tuesday
- **What's private?** Form field responses, task completions, internal comments, and assignment data don't show up publicly
- **How to unpublish?** Go back to settings, switch **Public to the world** to **no**, and it's instantly private again
