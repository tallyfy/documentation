## Publishing a template

To make a template publicly accessible:

1. Navigate to the Library view
2. Select the template you want to share
3. Click **Edit** then **Config**
4. Locate the permissions section
5. Set **Public to the world** to **yes**

After publishing, you can share the template link with colleagues, clients, and connections through email, social media, or other communication channels.
