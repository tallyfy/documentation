## Publishing templates publicly

To make a template public in Tallyfy, click **Edit** on your template, go to **Settings**, find **Public to the world**, and switch it to **yes**. That's it - anyone can now view your template structure[^1] without logging in.

This takes under 2 minutes and gives you a shareable link for external stakeholders.

### What you need for publishing
- Administrator or Standard member permissions
- A complete template ready for public sharing
- Understanding of what information becomes visible publicly

### Benefits of publishing templates
You might be wondering why you'd want to make templates public. Here's the thing - it's actually one of the most underutilized features for growing your business:

- **Share with anyone**: Give clients, partners, or vendors a direct link to view your process. No login required, no Tallyfy accounts needed
- **Show examples**: Display your workflows to potential customers - nothing builds trust like transparency about how you work
- **Provide documentation**: External teams can access process information instantly. Perfect for collaboration
- **Enable learning**: Let others see how you've structured your processes (yes, it's okay to share your secret sauce sometimes)

### Publishing a template

<Steps>
1. Go to the **Library** view where your templates are listed in Tallyfy
2. Find the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) you want to publish
3. Click **Edit** to open the template editor
4. Click **Settings** (or **Config**) in the editor toolbar
5. Scroll down to the permissions section
6. Find the **Public to the world** option and switch it to **yes**
7. Click **Save** - the entire process takes less than 2 minutes
</Steps>

### After publishing

Once your template is public, you'll get a shareable URL right in the template settings. Copy it.

Now you can:
- Share this link anywhere - email, chat, website, social media
- Let people view the template structure without any login hassles
- Track view counts in your activity log[^2] (great for seeing which templates generate the most interest)

Simple.

### Security and privacy
Here's what people often worry about - and it's a valid concern. What exactly are you exposing when you make a template public?

- **What's public?** Only the template structure (steps, descriptions) is visible. Think of it like sharing a recipe - people can see the ingredients and instructions, but not what you cooked last Tuesday
- **What's private?** All the actual data stays private. Form field responses, task completions, internal comments, who did what when - none of that shows up publicly. Your operational data is safe
- **How to unpublish?** Changed your mind? No problem. Go back to settings, switch "Public to the world" to "no", and it's instantly private again

The bottom line? You control exactly what's visible, and sensitive information never leaves Tallyfy.
