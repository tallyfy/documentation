## Publishing templates for public viewing

Tallyfy lets you make specific [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) public. This means anyone on the internet can view the template structure, even if they don't have a Tallyfy account.

### What you need
- Administrator or Standard [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) permissions.
- A finished [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) ready to be shared publicly.
- To understand what parts of the template will be visible to the public.

### Why publish a Template?
- **Share with anyone**: Give clients, partners, or others a link to view your process without needing them to log in.
- **Show examples**: Display your processes as examples for potential customers.
- **Provide documentation**: Offer easy access to process information for people outside your company.
- **Let others learn**: Allow people to see how you've designed your processes.

### Steps to publish a Template

<Steps>
1. Go to the **Library** view where your templates are listed.
2. Find the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) you want to publish.
3. Click **Edit** to open the template editor.
4. Click **Settings** (or **Config**) in the editor toolbar.
5. Scroll down to the permissions section.
6. Find the **Public to the world** option and switch it to **yes**.
7. Click **Save**.
</Steps>

### What to do after publishing a Template

Once a template is public:
- You can copy its public web address (URL) from the [template settings](/products/pro/documenting/templates/config/).
- Share this link anywhere (email, chat, website).
- People clicking the link can view the template structure.
- You can see how many times the public template has been viewed in the [template activity log](/products/pro/documenting/templates/how-can-i-track-activities-on-my-tallyfy-templates/).

### What about security?
- **What's public?** Only the template structure (steps, descriptions) is visible.
- **What's private?** Any information filled into [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) when the process runs, actual [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) completions, internal comments, and other sensitive data are **not** shown publicly.
- **How to unpublish?** You can make the template private again anytime by going back to the settings and switching **Public to the world** back to **no**.
