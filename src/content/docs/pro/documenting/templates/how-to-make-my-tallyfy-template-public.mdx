## Publishing templates for public access

Tallyfy allows you to make selected [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) available to anyone on the internet, including those without Tallyfy accounts.

### Requirements
- Administrator or Standard [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) permissions
- A completed [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) that is ready to share
- Understanding of which [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) content will be visible publicly

### Benefits of publishing Templates
- **External sharing** - Distribute [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) to clients or partners without Tallyfy accounts
- **Public examples** - Showcase your [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) expertise with potential clients
- **Reference material** - Provide accessible documentation for external stakeholders
- **Wider adoption** - Allow others to view and learn from your process designs

### Steps to publish a Template

<Steps>
1. Navigate to the Library view in your Tallyfy account
2. Select the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) you want to publish
3. Click **Edit** in the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) toolbar
4. Select **Config** from the editor menu
5. Scroll to the permissions section
6. Change the **Public to the world** setting to **yes**
7. Click **Save**
</Steps>

### After publishing a Template

Once published, you can:
- Copy the public URL from the [template settings](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)
- Share the link via email, messaging apps, or social media
- Embed the link in documentation or websites
- Track views through [template activity logs](/products/pro/documenting/templates/how-can-i-track-activities-on-my-tallyfy-templates/)

### Security considerations
- Only the [template structure](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) and descriptions are visible publicly
- [Form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) values and [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) completions remain private
- Internal comments and sensitive data are not exposed
- You can unpublish at any time by setting **Public to the world** back to **no**
