## Publishing templates publicly

Tallyfy lets you make specific templates public for broader access and transparency. Anyone on the internet can view the template structure without needing a Tallyfy account.

This lets you engage external stakeholders and show process transparency while keeping operational data secure.

### What you need for publishing
- Administrator or Standard member permissions
- A complete template ready for public sharing
- Understanding of what information becomes visible publicly

These requirements make sure only authorized users can publish templates while maintaining security.

### Benefits of publishing templates
- **Share with anyone**: Give clients, partners, or others a link to view your process without needing them to log in or create accounts
- **Show examples**: Display your processes as examples for potential customers to show capability and transparency
- **Provide documentation**: Offer easy access to process information for people outside your company for collaboration
- **Enable learning**: Allow people to see how you've designed your processes for knowledge sharing and best practice demonstration

These benefits improve external collaboration while protecting sensitive information.

### Publishing a template

<Steps>
1. Go to the **Library** view where your templates are listed
2. Find the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) you want to publish
3. Click **Edit** to open the template editor
4. Click **Settings** (or **Config**) in the editor toolbar
5. Scroll down to the permissions section
6. Find the **Public to the world** option and switch it to **yes**
7. Click **Save**
</Steps>

### After publishing

Once a template is public, you can:
- Copy the public web address (URL) from template settings
- Share this link anywhere (email, chat, website) with stakeholders
- Let people view the template structure without requiring login
- Track how many times the template has been viewed in the activity log

These features help you manage and monitor public template usage.

### Security and privacy
- **What's public?** Only the template structure (steps, descriptions) is visible to external viewers for transparency
- **What's private?** Any information filled into form fields when the process runs, actual task completions, internal comments, and other sensitive operational data aren't shown publicly
- **How to unpublish?** You can make the template private again anytime by going back to the settings and switching "Public to the world" back to "no" for immediate privacy restoration

These security measures make sure you get transparency while protecting sensitive operational data.
