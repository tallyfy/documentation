## How can I publish templates for public viewing and sharing?

Tallyfy lets you make specific templates public, enabling broader accessibility and transparency. This means anyone on the internet can view the template structure, even if they don't have a Tallyfy account.

Publishing templates enables external stakeholder engagement and process transparency without compromising operational security.

### What prerequisites are needed to publish a template?
- Administrator or Standard member permissions for security and access control.
- A finished template ready to be shared publicly with complete and accurate content.
- Understanding of what parts of the template will be visible to the public for appropriate disclosure.

These requirements ensure only authorized users can make templates public while maintaining data security standards.

### What benefits does publishing templates provide?
- **Share with anyone**: Give clients, partners, or others a link to view your process without needing them to log in or create accounts.
- **Show examples**: Display your processes as examples for potential customers to demonstrate capability and transparency.
- **Provide documentation**: Offer easy access to process information for people outside your company for collaboration.
- **Enable learning**: Allow people to see how you've designed your processes for knowledge sharing and best practice demonstration.

These benefits enhance external collaboration while maintaining appropriate boundaries around sensitive information.

### How can I publish a template for public access?

<Steps>
1. Go to the **Library** view where your templates are listed.
2. Find the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) you want to publish.
3. Click **Edit** to open the template editor.
4. Click **Settings** (or **Config**) in the editor toolbar.
5. Scroll down to the permissions section.
6. Find the **Public to the world** option and switch it to **yes**.
7. Click **Save**.
</Steps>

### What should I do after publishing a template successfully?

Once a template is public, several management and sharing options become available:
- You can copy its public web address (URL) from the template settings for distribution.
- Share this link anywhere (email, chat, website) with stakeholders who need access.
- People clicking the link can view the template structure without authentication requirements.
- You can see how many times the public template has been viewed in the template activity log for usage tracking.

These capabilities enable effective public template management and usage monitoring.

### What security considerations apply to published templates?
- **What's public?** Only the template structure (steps, descriptions) is visible to external viewers for transparency.
- **What's private?** Any information filled into form fields when the process runs, actual task completions, internal comments, and other sensitive operational data are not shown publicly.
- **How to unpublish?** You can make the template private again anytime by going back to the settings and switching "Public to the world" back to "no" for immediate privacy restoration.

These security measures ensure process transparency while protecting sensitive operational information and maintaining organizational confidentiality.
