## Publishing templates for public access

Tallyfy allows you to make selected templates available to anyone on the internet, including those without Tallyfy accounts.

### Prerequisites
- Administrator or Standard member permissions
- A completed template that is ready to share
- Understanding of which template content will be visible publicly

### Benefits of publishing templates
- **External sharing** - Distribute templates to clients or partners without Tallyfy accounts
- **Public examples** - Showcase your process expertise with potential clients
- **Reference material** - Provide accessible documentation for external stakeholders
- **Wider adoption** - Allow others to view and learn from your process designs

### Steps to publish a template

1. Navigate to the Library view in your Tallyfy account
2. Select the template you want to publish
3. Click **Edit** in the template toolbar
4. Select **Config** from the editor menu
5. Scroll to the permissions section
6. Change the **Public to the world** setting to **yes**
7. Click **Save**

### After publishing a template

Once published, you can:
- Copy the public URL from the template settings
- Share the link via email, messaging apps, or social media
- Embed the link in documentation or websites
- Track views through template activity logs

### Security considerations
- Only the template structure and descriptions are visible publicly
- Form field values and task completions remain private
- Internal comments and sensitive data are not exposed
- You can unpublish at any time by setting **Public to the world** back to **no**
