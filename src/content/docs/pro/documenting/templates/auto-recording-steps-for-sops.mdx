## Capturing procedures without expensive recording tools

You don't need paid tools like Scribe, Trainual, or iorad to document your procedures. Free screen capture tools combined with Tallyfy's rich text editor give you everything needed to create comprehensive step-by-step instructions. The real value isn't in capturing steps - it's in tracking completion, automating workflows, and ensuring procedures actually get followed.

### Why paid capture tools aren't necessary

Services like Scribe, Trainual, or iorad lock your content into proprietary formats. Once you document a process with these tools, you're stuck paying monthly fees just to access your own procedures. Plus they only solve the easy part - capturing steps. They don't help you:

- Track who completed which steps
- Automate task assignments
- Set deadlines and send reminders  
- Collect data during execution
- Analyze process performance

That's where Tallyfy shines. Focus on free capture, then use Tallyfy for the hard part - making procedures actually work.

<Aside type="tip" title="Content ownership matters">
When you use proprietary documentation tools, exporting your content often means losing formatting, interactivity, or even access entirely if you stop paying. Keep your documentation portable by using standard formats (images, videos, HTML) that you control.

## Bringing captured content into Tallyfy

### Method 1: Image-based steps (Scribe-style)

Create numbered lists with screenshots for each step:

1. Capture screenshots while performing the procedure
2. In your [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), click **Edit**
3. For each step, type the instruction text
4. Click **Insert → Image** to add the screenshot
5. Choose upload (for local files) or URL (for hosted images)

This creates clean, scannable instructions similar to paid tools but without the monthly fees.

### Method 2: Video walkthroughs

Record the entire procedure as video:

1. Record using OBS, Kap, or built-in tools
2. Upload to YouTube/Vimeo as unlisted
3. In Tallyfy, click **Insert → Embed URL**
4. Paste the video URL
5. Add text descriptions for key steps below

Videos work great for complex UI procedures where motion helps explain the flow.

### Method 3: Animated GIF loops

Perfect for demonstrating specific interactions:

1. Use ScreenToGif (Windows) or Kap (Mac) to record 3-10 second loops
2. Export as optimized GIF
3. Insert as images in Tallyfy
4. GIFs animate automatically in the task view

Short loops explain drag-and-drop, hover states, or multi-step clicks better than static images.

### Method 4: HTML content embedding

If you have HTML output from tools:

1. Host the HTML on your web server
2. Use **Insert → Embed URL** to embed the content
3. Or copy text from HTML, paste into Tallyfy
4. Rebuild formatting using Tallyfy's [rich text editor](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/edit-task/how-can-i-use-tallyfys-rich-text-editor-for-tasks/)

Note: Tallyfy strips most HTML formatting when pasting to maintain consistency.

## What makes Tallyfy different

### Beyond documentation - actual execution

While capture tools stop at documentation, Tallyfy ensures procedures get done:

- **Assignment automation** - Routes tasks to the right [job titles](/products/pro/documenting/templates/edit-templates/understanding-assignment-types/) or groups
- **Deadline management** - Sets due dates and sends reminders
- **Progress tracking** - See who's stuck and where bottlenecks occur
- **Data collection** - [Form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) capture information during execution
- **Conditional logic** - [Automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) adapt procedures based on responses
- **Completion verification** - Approval steps ensure quality control

### Real examples of Tallyfy vs documentation tools

**Employee onboarding**
- Scribe/Trainual: Static checklist with screenshots
- Tallyfy: Automatically assigns IT setup to tech team, schedules training based on start date, collects equipment confirmations, tracks completion across departments

**Customer support procedures**
- iorad: Interactive tutorial for agents to review
- Tallyfy: Routes tickets by type, escalates if SLA breached, collects resolution data, triggers follow-ups

**Quality inspections**
- Dozuki: Work instructions with images
- Tallyfy: Enforces inspection schedule, captures defects with photos, routes issues to quality team, generates compliance reports

## Avoiding vendor lock-in

### Problems with paid documentation platforms

**Scribe** - Exports only as PDF or requires paid team access. Lose interactivity and ability to update.

**Trainual** - Content lives in their system. Canceling means rebuilding everything elsewhere.

**iorad** - Tutorials break if UI changes. Expensive to maintain for large teams.

**Dozuki** - Requires annual contracts. Migration is complex and often incomplete.

**WorkRamp** - Learning content trapped in their LMS. No easy bulk export.

### Keep your content portable

Store your source materials independently:
- Keep original screenshots in cloud storage
- Save screen recordings as standard MP4 files  
- Maintain text instructions in documents
- Use open formats (HTML, Markdown) when possible

This way you can move between platforms without losing work.

2. Paste into Tallyfy (formatting stripped)
3. Rebuild structure with editor tools
4. Insert images individually

**From PDFs**:
1. Extract text and images using free tools
2. Recreate as structured Tallyfy steps
3. Attach original PDF as reference if needed

**From wikis/knowledge bases**:
1. Export as HTML or Markdown
2. Copy section by section
3. Convert to step-based format
4. Add automation and tracking

## Best practices for procedure capture

### What to document visually vs text

**Use screenshots for**:
- Complex UI with many options
- Specific button locations
- Form field examples
- Error messages
- Configuration screens

**Use video for**:
- Multi-step sequences
- Drag and drop actions
- Timing-sensitive procedures
- Processes with motion/animation
- Verbal explanation needed

**Use text only for**:
- Simple linear steps
- Conceptual information
- Policies and rules
- Decision criteria
- Background context

### Optimizing file sizes

Keep procedures loading fast:
- Resize images to max 1920px wide
- Use JPEG for photos, PNG for screenshots
- Compress images with free tools (TinyPNG)
- Keep videos under 5 minutes per step
- Use YouTube/Vimeo for longer videos

### Maintenance and updates

Make procedures easy to maintain:
- Capture at lowest UI detail needed
- Focus on workflow not exact pixels
- Use generic examples not real data
- Date your screenshots for version tracking
- Link to external systems rather than duplicating

## Moving beyond documentation

Documentation is just the beginning. The hard part is ensuring procedures get followed, measuring performance, and continuously improving. That's what Tallyfy does that capture tools can't:

- **Launch procedures** with [kick-off forms](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/)
- **Track progress** in [real-time](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)
- **Analyze performance** with [Tallyfy Analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/)
- **Connect systems** via [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) and [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/)
- **Integrate platforms** through [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/)

Stop paying for expensive documentation tools that only solve the easy part. Use free capture tools for recording steps, then leverage Tallyfy for what really matters - making sure work gets done right, every time.
