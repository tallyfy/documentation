## Capturing procedures without expensive recording tools

You don't need paid tools like Scribe, Trainual, or iorad to document procedures. Free screen capture tools plus Tallyfy's rich text editor cover everything you need for step-by-step instructions. The real value isn't capturing steps - it's tracking completion, automating workflows, and making sure procedures actually get followed.

### Why paid capture tools aren't necessary

Tools like Scribe, Trainual, or iorad lock your content into proprietary formats. You're stuck paying monthly fees just to access your own procedures. Worse, they only solve the easy part - capturing steps. They don't help you:

- Track who completed which steps
- Automate task assignments
- Set deadlines and send reminders
- Collect data during execution
- Analyze process performance

Tallyfy handles the hard part - making procedures actually work.

<Aside type="tip" title="Content ownership matters">
Proprietary documentation tools often mean losing formatting, interactivity, or access entirely if you stop paying. Keep your documentation portable by using standard formats (images, videos, HTML) that you control.
</Aside>

## Free tools for capturing procedures

## Bringing captured content into Tallyfy

### Method 1: Image-based steps (Scribe-style)

1. Capture screenshots while performing the procedure
2. In your [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), click **Edit**
3. For each step, type the instruction text
4. Use the image button in the toolbar to add the screenshot
5. Choose upload (for local files) or URL (for hosted images)

### Method 2: Video walkthroughs

1. Record using OBS, Kap, or built-in tools
2. Upload to YouTube/Vimeo as unlisted
3. In Tallyfy's editor, use the video or embed button in the toolbar
4. Paste the video URL
5. Add text descriptions for key steps below

Videos work well for UI procedures where motion helps explain the flow.

### Method 3: Animated GIF loops

1. Use ScreenToGif (Windows) or Kap (Mac) to record 3-10 second loops
2. Export as a compressed GIF
3. Insert as images in Tallyfy
4. GIFs animate automatically in the task view

Short loops explain drag-and-drop, hover states, or multi-step clicks better than static images.

### Method 4: HTML content embedding

1. Host the HTML on your web server
2. Use the embed button in Tallyfy's toolbar to embed the content
3. Or copy text from HTML and paste into Tallyfy
4. Rebuild formatting using Tallyfy's [rich text editor](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/edit-task/how-can-i-use-tallyfys-rich-text-editor-for-tasks/)

Tallyfy strips most HTML formatting when pasting to maintain consistency.

## What makes Tallyfy different

### Beyond documentation - actual execution

Capture tools stop at documentation. Tallyfy makes sure procedures get done:

- **Assignment automation** - Routes tasks to the right [job titles](/products/pro/documenting/templates/edit-templates/understanding-assignment-types/) or groups
- **Deadline management** - Sets due dates and sends reminders
- **Progress tracking** - See who's stuck and where bottlenecks occur
- **Data collection** - [Form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) capture information during execution
- **Conditional logic** - [Automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) adapt procedures based on responses
- **Completion verification** - Approval steps for quality control

### Real examples

**Employee onboarding**
- Scribe/Trainual: Static checklist with screenshots
- Tallyfy: Auto-assigns IT setup to tech team, schedules training by start date, collects equipment confirmations, tracks completion across departments

**Customer support procedures**
- iorad: Interactive tutorial for agents to review
- Tallyfy: Routes tickets by type, escalates if SLA breached, collects resolution data, triggers follow-ups

**Quality inspections**
- Dozuki: Work instructions with images
- Tallyfy: Enforces inspection schedule, captures defects with photos, routes issues to quality team

## Avoiding vendor lock-in

### Problems with paid documentation platforms

**Scribe** - Exports only as PDF or requires paid team access. Lose interactivity and ability to update.

**Trainual** - Content lives in their system. Canceling means rebuilding everything elsewhere.

**iorad** - Tutorials break if UI changes. Expensive to maintain for large teams.

**Dozuki** - Requires annual contracts. Migration is complex and often incomplete.

**WorkRamp** - Learning content trapped in their LMS. No easy bulk export.

### Keep your content portable

- Keep original screenshots in cloud storage
- Save screen recordings as standard MP4 files
- Store text instructions in documents you own
- Use open formats (HTML, Markdown) when possible

This way you can switch platforms without losing work.

## Quick start guide

### Capture your first SOP in 10 minutes

1. **Choose your capture tool**
   - Windows: ShareX for screenshots or Xbox Game Bar for video
   - Mac: Built-in screenshot tool or Kap for recordings
   - Any browser: Screenity extension

2. **Perform the procedure** while capturing
   - Take a screenshot at each decision point
   - Or record the entire flow as video
   - Add annotations to highlight key areas

3. **Create your Tallyfy template**
   - Go to [Templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)
   - Click **Create New**
   - Add your captured content to each step

4. **Add Tallyfy features**
   - Add [variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/) to personalize instructions

   - Configure [deadline rules](/products/pro/documenting/templates/edit-templates/) for time-sensitive steps
   - Include [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to collect data

5. **Test and refine**
   - [Launch a test process](/products/pro/launching/)
   - Gather feedback through comments
   - Update based on real usage

## Integration with existing content

### Embedding external tutorials

Already have procedures hosted elsewhere? Embed them in Tallyfy:

- **Google Docs/Sheets**: Publish to web, embed URL
- **YouTube/Vimeo videos**: Paste link into Embed URL
- **Miro/Mural boards**: Share public link, embed
- **Figma prototypes**: Get embed code, insert
- **SharePoint pages**: If publicly accessible, embed URL

### Converting existing documentation

**From Word/Google Docs**:
1. Copy text content
2. Paste into Tallyfy (formatting stripped)
3. Rebuild structure with editor tools
4. Insert images individually

**From PDFs**:
1. Extract text and images using free tools
2. Recreate as structured Tallyfy steps
3. Attach original PDF as reference if needed

**From wikis/knowledge bases**:
1. Export as HTML or Markdown
2. Copy section by section
3. Convert to step-based format
4. Add automation and tracking

## Best practices for procedure capture

### What to document visually vs text

**Use screenshots for**:
- Complex UI with many options
- Specific button locations
- Form field examples
- Error messages
- Configuration screens

**Use video for**:
- Multi-step sequences
- Drag and drop actions
- Timing-sensitive procedures
- Processes with motion/animation
- Verbal explanation needed

**Use text only for**:
- Simple linear steps
- Conceptual information
- Policies and rules
- Decision criteria
- Background context

### Keeping file sizes small

Keep procedures loading fast:
- Resize images to max 1920px wide
- Use JPEG for photos, PNG for screenshots
- Compress images with free tools (TinyPNG)
- Keep videos under 5 minutes per step
- Use YouTube/Vimeo for longer videos

### Maintenance

- Capture at the lowest UI detail needed
- Focus on workflow, not exact pixels
- Use generic examples, not real data
- Date your screenshots for version tracking
- Link to external systems rather than duplicating

## Moving beyond documentation

Documentation is the starting point. Tallyfy handles what capture tools can't:

- **Launch procedures** with [kick-off forms](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/)
- **Track progress** in [real-time](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)
- **Analyze performance** with [Tallyfy Analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/)
- **Connect systems** via [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) and [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/)
- **Integrate platforms** through [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/)
