## Template Tools

Template Tools let you change multiple parts of a template at once - bulk-create steps, assign people, adjust deadlines, and manage favorites. No more clicking through each step individually.

### Requirements
- Edit access to the template
- Standard role with edit permission, or Administrator role

### Accessing Template Tools
1. Open a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in edit mode.
2. Click **Tools** in the toolbar at the top of the editor.
3. The Tools modal opens with tabs: **Build Steps**, **Assign**, **Deadlines**, and (for Administrators) **Favorites**.

### Bulk step creation

Add many steps at once instead of creating them one by one.

- **Copy/paste friendly** - got your process in a Word doc? Paste the whole list
- **Fast** - go from blank template to fully structured in minutes

#### How to bulk-create steps
1. Open the **Build Steps** tab in Template Tools.
2. Type or paste your step names into the text box. Put each step name on its own line.
3. Click **BUILD**. Tallyfy adds all steps to your [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in the order you listed them.

### Batch assignment

Assign (or unassign) one person or group to many steps at once.

- **Consistency** - when the finance team owns all budget approvals, they actually get assigned to all of them
- **Fewer mistakes** - can't forget step 17 when you're assigning in bulk

#### How to batch-assign
1. Open the **Assign** tab in Template Tools.
2. Choose the person or group ([assignee](/products/pro/documenting/members/)) from the dropdown.
3. Toggle **Assign** or **Unassign** on each step you want to change.
4. Click **APPLY** to save.

### Bulk deadline adjustment

Adjust deadlines across multiple steps without editing each one.

- **Quick updates** - contract terms changed? Adjust every deadline in seconds
- **Consistent SLAs** - set the same timing across all review steps at once

#### How to adjust deadlines in bulk
1. Open the **Deadlines** tab in Template Tools.
2. For each step, use the increment (+) and decrement (-) buttons to adjust the deadline value.
3. Choose the time unit per step (minutes, hours, days, weeks, months)[^1].
4. Click **UPDATE**.

*Note: For templates, deadlines are relative to when the process is [launched](/products/pro/launching/). You can't set deadlines based on when other steps complete.*

### Template favoriting (Administrators only)

Add a template to other users' favorites so they can find and use it quickly.

- **Visibility** - put the right templates front and center for your team
- **New hires** - day one, they've got essential processes starred and ready
- **Notifications** - watchers get notified when a favorited template is updated[^2]

#### How to favorite a template for others
1. Open the **Favorites** tab in Template Tools (visible only to Administrators).
2. Search for and select the team [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) you want to add this template as a favorite for.
3. Click **Favorites** to save.
4. The [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) appears in those users' Favorites section.

*Learn more about favorites in the [Favorite section guide](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/organize-processes/how-can-i-favorite-and-filter-processes-on-tallyfy/).*
