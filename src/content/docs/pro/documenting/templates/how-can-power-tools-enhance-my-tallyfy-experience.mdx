## How to use Template Tools for faster template editing

Template Tools offer quick ways to make changes to many parts of your [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) at once. These tools help you build and manage templates faster.

### What you need
- Access to edit the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) you want to change.
- Permission to edit templates (Standard role with permission, or Administrator role).

### Finding the Template Tools
1. Open a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in edit mode.
2. Click **Settings** (or **Config**) in the toolbar at the top.
3. Click the **Tools** tab in the panel that opens.

### Add many steps at once (Bulk Step Creation)

Instead of adding steps one by one, you can create many at the same time.

#### Why use this?
- **Save time**: Add lots of [steps](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in just a few seconds.
- **Easy copy/paste**: Paste a list of step names from another document or spreadsheet.
- **Build faster**: Quickly set up standard process outlines.

#### How to use it
1. Go to the **Tools** tab (in Template Settings).
2. Find the **Create Steps** section.
3. Type or paste your step names into the box. Put each step name on its own line.
4. Click **BUILD**. Tallyfy will add all the steps to your [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in the order you listed them.

### Power Builder for quick process conversion

When creating a new template, the Power Builder allows you to quickly convert existing process documentation into template steps. This is especially useful if you already have your processes documented in other formats.

#### Why use Power Builder?
- **Convert existing documentation**: Turn documents or spreadsheets with process steps into Tallyfy templates.
- **Fast template creation**: Quickly create the structure of a template from listed steps.
- **No retyping needed**: Save time by pasting steps instead of creating them one by one.

#### How to use Power Builder
1. When creating a new template procedure, click on **Power Builder** in the upper right corner.
2. Type or paste your list of steps in the text area. Each step must be on its own line.
3. Click **Build Steps**.
4. Tallyfy will create all the steps in your template in the order you listed them.
5. You can then edit each step to add more details, assignments, deadlines, etc.

### Assign many steps at once (Batch Assignment)

Quickly assign multiple [steps](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to the same person or group.

#### Why use this?
- **Faster assigning**: Assign lots of [steps](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) without clicking each one.
- **Consistency**: Make sure the right person/group is assigned correctly across many steps.
- **Fewer mistakes**: Less chance of forgetting to assign a step.

#### How to use it
1. Go to the **Tools** tab.
2. Find the **Assign Steps** section.
3. Choose the person or group ([assignee](/products/pro/documenting/members/)) from the dropdown list.
4. Check the boxes next to all the steps you want to assign to them.
5. Click **Assign**.
6. Click **APPLY** to save the assignments.
   *(You can also use this to unassign someone from multiple steps at once.)*

### Change many deadlines at once (Bulk Deadline Adjustment)

Change the [deadlines](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) for multiple [steps](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) at the same time.

#### Why use this?
- **Manage timing**: Easily set deadlines that are spaced out consistently.
- **Quick updates**: Change timelines quickly if the process needs change.
- **Standard timing**: Apply the same deadline rules across similar [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).

#### How to use it
1. Go to the **Tools** tab.
2. Find the **Adjust Deadlines** section.
3. Choose if you want to add (+) or subtract (-) time.
4. Enter a number.
5. Choose the time unit (minutes, hours, days, weeks, months).
6. Check the boxes next to all the [steps](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) whose deadlines you want to change.
7. Click **UPDATE**.

*Note: This tool changes deadlines based on when the process is [launched](/products/pro/launching/). It doesn't currently let you set deadlines based on when other steps are completed.*

### Make a template a favorite for others (Template Favoriting)

Administrators can add a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) to other team [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/)' favorites list for them. This also automatically makes those members "watch" the template, so they can get notified about changes.

#### Why use this?
- **Help people find templates**: Make important or new templates easier for team members to see.
- **Encourage use**: Guide people towards using the correct or preferred templates.
- **New hires**: Help new team members quickly find the processes they need.
- **Keep people updated**: Members who favorite (or have favorited for them) can get notified if the template changes.

#### How to use it (Administrators only)
1. Go to the **Tools** tab.
2. Find the **Favorite Template** section.
3. Type the names or email addresses of the team [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) you want to add this template as a favorite for. Separate multiple people with commas.
4. Click **Add to Favorites**.
5. The [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) will now show up in those users' "Favorites" tab in their template library. They can then manage their own notification settings for watched templates.

*Learn more about favorites in the [Favorite section guide](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/organize-processes/how-can-i-favorite-and-filter-processes-on-tallyfy/).*
