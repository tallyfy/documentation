### Template favoriting

The Template Favoriting powertool allows administrators to add templates to multiple team members' favorites lists simultaneously. When you add a template to someone's favorites, you're not just bookmarking it for them - you're also enabling them to "watch" the template for changes, complete with notification options.

#### Benefits
- **Visibility** - Increase template discovery for team members
- **Adoption** - Encourage use of preferred templates across the organization
- **Onboarding** - Help new users find important processes immediately
- **Change awareness** - Team members will automatically receive notifications about template updates
- **Standardization** - Ensure everyone is working from and aware of the latest template versions

#### How to use template favoriting
1. Access the Powertools section
2. Locate the **Favorite Template** panel
3. Enter team member names or email addresses in the text box
   - Separate multiple entries with commas
   - Select from suggested users as you type
4. Click **Add to Favorites**
5. The template will appear in each user's favorites tab and they can configure their notification preferences for watching it

When a template is added to a user's favorites, they can adjust their notification frequency (Electric, Mindful, or Chilled) from their Favorites section. See [Favorite section](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/organize-processes/how-can-i-favorite-and-filter-processes-on-tallyfy/) for more details on managing favorites and notifications.
