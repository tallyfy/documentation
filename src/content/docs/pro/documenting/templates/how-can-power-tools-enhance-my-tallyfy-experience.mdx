## How to use Template Tools for efficient template management

Template Tools provide advanced productivity features that streamline [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) creation and management through batch operations and time-saving shortcuts.

### Requirements
- Access to the [Template Editor](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)
- Permission to edit [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)
- A [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) to work with

### Accessing Template Tools
1. Open a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in edit mode
2. Click **Config** in the top toolbar
3. Select the **Tools** tab in the configuration panel

### Bulk step creation

Create multiple [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) [steps](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) simultaneously instead of adding them one by one.

#### Benefits
- **Time savings** - Add many [steps](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in seconds
- **Ease of use** - Simply paste in [step titles](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) from other documents
- **Consistency** - Quickly implement standardized [process structures](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)

#### How to use bulk step creation
1. Access the **Tools** section
2. Locate the **Create Steps** panel
3. Enter each [step title](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) on a separate line
   - Copy-paste from existing documents or
   - Type each step manually
4. Click **BUILD** to generate all steps at once
5. The [steps](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) will be added to your [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in the order listed

Paste in a bunch of steps from somewhere else like a document or spreadsheet. Tallyfy will create one [step](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) per line in bulk.

### Batch assignment

Assign multiple [steps](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to the same person in a single operation.

#### Benefits
- **Efficiency** - Assign numerous [steps](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) quickly
- **Consistency** - Ensure proper [role assignment](/products/pro/documenting/members/) across steps
- **Error reduction** - Avoid missing assignments

#### How to use batch assignment
1. Access the **Tools** section
2. Navigate to the **Assign Steps** panel
3. Select the [assignee](/products/pro/documenting/members/) from the dropdown menu
4. Choose the steps to assign:
   - Use checkboxes to select specific steps
   - Or use the "Select All" option
5. Click **Assign** to create the assignments
6. Click **APPLY** to save changes

Assign a particular [assignee](/products/pro/documenting/members/) to one or more steps in bulk. You can also unassign an [assignee](/products/pro/documenting/members/) on steps in bulk.

### Bulk deadline adjustment

Modify [deadlines](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) for multiple [steps](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) simultaneously.

#### Benefits
- **Timing management** - Consistently space [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) deadlines
- **Flexibility** - Quickly adjust timelines when [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) requirements change
- **Standardization** - Apply uniform timing across similar [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)

#### How to use bulk deadline adjustment
1. Access the **Tools** section
2. Go to the **Adjust Deadlines** panel
3. Specify the time adjustment:
   - Select + (add) or - (subtract)
   - Enter a number value
   - Choose the time unit (minutes, hours, days, weeks, months)
4. Select the [steps](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to modify using the checkboxes
5. Click **UPDATE** to apply the changes

Change [deadlines](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) on [steps](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in bulk. The base deadline is the [launch date](/products/pro/launching/) of the [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), which is whatever the current date/time is when you [launch it](/products/pro/launching/). You then pick new [deadlines](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) relative to that. You can also see your original deadline. At present, we don't support showing or bulk-changing deadlines relative to other steps.

### Template favoriting

The Template Favoriting tool allows [administrators](/products/pro/documenting/members/) to add [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) to multiple team [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) favorites lists simultaneously. When you add a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) to someone's favorites, you're not just bookmarking it for them - you're also enabling them to "watch" the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) for changes, complete with notification options.

#### Benefits
- **Visibility** - Increase template discovery for [team members](/products/pro/documenting/members/)
- **Adoption** - Encourage use of preferred templates across the organization
- **Onboarding** - Help new users find important [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) immediately
- **Change awareness** - [Team members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) will automatically receive notifications about template updates
- **Standardization** - Ensure everyone is working from and aware of the latest template versions

#### How to use template favoriting
1. Access the **Tools** section
2. Locate the **Favorite Template** panel
3. Enter team [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) names or email addresses in the text box
   - Separate multiple entries with commas
   - Select from suggested users as you type
4. Click **Add to Favorites**
5. The [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) will appear in each user's favorites tab and they can configure their notification preferences for watching it

Add this [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) to the list of favorites of particular [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/), without the member themselves needing to do it themselves. This also "watches" the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) automatically. For more details on managing favorites and notifications, see [Favorite section](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/organize-processes/how-can-i-favorite-and-filter-processes-on-tallyfy/).

### Best practices for using Template Tools
- Review results after bulk operations to ensure accuracy
- Use bulk [step creation](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) when implementing standardized [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)
- Apply batch assignment for [steps](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) that logically belong to the same [role](/products/pro/documenting/members/)
- Adjust [deadlines](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to reflect realistic completion timeframes
- Add [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) to favorites for frequently used processes and onboarding
