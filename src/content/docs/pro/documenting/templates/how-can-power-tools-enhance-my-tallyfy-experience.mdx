## Template management with Template Tools

Template Tools provide advanced productivity features that streamline template creation and management through batch operations and time-saving shortcuts.

### Prerequisites
- Access to the Template Editor
- Permission to edit templates
- A template to work with

### Accessing Template Tools
1. Open a template in edit mode
2. Click **Config** in the top toolbar
3. Select the **Tools** tab in the configuration panel

### Bulk step creation

Create multiple template steps simultaneously instead of adding them one by one.

#### Benefits
- **Time savings** - Add many steps in seconds
- **Ease of use** - Simply paste in step titles from other documents
- **Consistency** - Quickly implement standardized process structures

#### How to use bulk step creation
1. Access the **Tools** section
2. Locate the **Create Steps** panel
3. Enter each step title on a separate line
   - Copy-paste from existing documents or
   - Type each step manually
4. Click **BUILD** to generate all steps at once
5. The steps will be added to your template in the order listed

Paste in a bunch of steps from somewhere else like a document or spreadsheet. Tallyfy will create one step per line in bulk.

### Batch assignment

Assign multiple steps to the same person in a single operation.

#### Benefits
- **Efficiency** - Assign numerous steps quickly
- **Consistency** - Ensure proper role assignment across steps
- **Error reduction** - Avoid missing assignments

#### How to use batch assignment
1. Access the **Tools** section
2. Navigate to the **Assign Steps** panel
3. Select the assignee from the dropdown menu
4. Choose the steps to assign:
   - Use checkboxes to select specific steps
   - Or use the "Select All" option
5. Click **Assign** to create the assignments
6. Click **APPLY** to save changes

Assign a particular assignee to one or more steps in bulk. You can also unassign an assignee on steps in bulk.

### Bulk deadline adjustment

Modify deadlines for multiple steps simultaneously.

#### Benefits
- **Timing management** - Consistently space task deadlines
- **Flexibility** - Quickly adjust timelines when process requirements change
- **Standardization** - Apply uniform timing across similar processes

#### How to use bulk deadline adjustment
1. Access the **Tools** section
2. Go to the **Adjust Deadlines** panel
3. Specify the time adjustment:
   - Select + (add) or - (subtract)
   - Enter a number value
   - Choose the time unit (minutes, hours, days, weeks, months)
4. Select the steps to modify using the checkboxes
5. Click **UPDATE** to apply the changes

Change deadlines on steps in bulk. The base deadline is the launch date of the process, which is whatever the current date/time is when you launch it. You then pick new deadlines relative to that. You can also see your original deadline. At present, we don't support showing or bulk-changing deadlines relative to other steps.

### Template favoriting

The Template Favoriting tool allows administrators to add templates to multiple team members' favorites lists simultaneously. When you add a template to someone's favorites, you're not just bookmarking it for them - you're also enabling them to "watch" the template for changes, complete with notification options.

#### Benefits
- **Visibility** - Increase template discovery for team members
- **Adoption** - Encourage use of preferred templates across the organization
- **Onboarding** - Help new users find important processes immediately
- **Change awareness** - Team members will automatically receive notifications about template updates
- **Standardization** - Ensure everyone is working from and aware of the latest template versions

#### How to use template favoriting
1. Access the **Tools** section
2. Locate the **Favorite Template** panel
3. Enter team member names or email addresses in the text box
   - Separate multiple entries with commas
   - Select from suggested users as you type
4. Click **Add to Favorites**
5. The template will appear in each user's favorites tab and they can configure their notification preferences for watching it

Add this template to the list of favorites of particular members, without the member themselves needing to do it themselves. This also "watches" the template automatically. For more details on managing favorites and notifications, see [Favorite section](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/organize-processes/how-can-i-favorite-and-filter-processes-on-tallyfy/).

- Adjust deadlines to reflect realistic completion timeframes
- Add templates to favorites for frequently used processes and onboarding
