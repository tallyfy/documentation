## Using Template Tools for faster editing

Template Tools let you make changes to lots of parts of your template at once - this speeds up template development and maintenance big time. These tools help you build and manage templates way faster by automating repetitive tasks.

Template Tools get rid of time-consuming manual processes and let you do bulk operations that would otherwise need individual attention.

### What you need to use Template Tools
- Access to edit the template you want to change
- Permission to edit templates (Standard role with permission, or Administrator role)

These requirements make sure only authorized users can make bulk changes to workflow templates.

### Accessing Template Tools
1. Open a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in edit mode.
2. Click **Settings** (or **Config**) in the toolbar at the top.
3. Click the **Tools** tab in the panel that opens.

### Bulk step creation

Instead of adding steps one by one, you can create many at the same time for efficient template development.

#### Benefits of bulk step creation
- **Save time**: Add lots of steps in just a few seconds instead of individual creation.
- **Easy copy/paste**: Paste a list of step names from another document or spreadsheet directly.
- **Build faster**: Quickly set up standard process outlines without repetitive clicking.

This approach cuts template creation time for complex workflows with many steps.

#### Using bulk step creation
1. Go to the **Tools** tab (in Template Settings).
2. Find the **Create Steps** section.
3. Type or paste your step names into the box. Put each step name on its own line.
4. Click **BUILD**. Tallyfy will add all the steps to your [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in the order you listed them.

### Power Builder for process conversion

When creating a new template, the Power Builder allows you to quickly convert existing process documentation into template steps. This is especially useful if you already have your processes documented in other formats.

#### Benefits of Power Builder
- **Convert existing documentation**: Turn documents or spreadsheets with process steps into Tallyfy templates seamlessly.
- **Fast template creation**: Quickly create the structure of a template from listed steps without manual recreation.
- **No retyping needed**: Save time by pasting steps instead of creating them one by one manually.

This tool connects existing documentation with digital workflow automation.

#### Using Power Builder
1. When creating a new template procedure, click on **Power Builder** in the upper right corner.
2. Type or paste your list of steps in the text area. Each step must be on its own line.
3. Click **Build Steps**.
4. Tallyfy will create all the steps in your template in the order you listed them.
5. You can then edit each step to add more details, assignments, deadlines, etc.

### Batch assignment

Quickly assign multiple steps to the same person or group for efficient workflow distribution.

#### Benefits of batch assignment
- **Faster assigning**: Assign lots of steps without clicking each one individually, saving significant time.
- **Consistency**: Make sure the right person/group is assigned correctly across many steps for uniform responsibility.
- **Fewer mistakes**: Less chance of forgetting to assign a step due to systematic batch processing.

This approach ensures comprehensive task assignment while reducing administrative work.

#### Using batch assignment
1. Go to the **Tools** tab.
2. Find the **Assign Steps** section.
3. Choose the person or group ([assignee](/products/pro/documenting/members/)) from the dropdown list.
4. Check the boxes next to all the steps you want to assign to them.
5. Click **Assign**.
6. Click **APPLY** to save the assignments.
   *(You can also use this to unassign someone from multiple steps at once.)*

### Bulk deadline adjustment

Change the deadlines for multiple steps at the same time for consistent timeline management.

#### Benefits of bulk deadline adjustment
- **Manage timing**: Easily set deadlines that are spaced out consistently across workflow steps.
- **Quick updates**: Change timelines quickly if the process requirements need adjustment.
- **Standard timing**: Apply the same deadline rules across similar processes for organizational consistency.

This tool enables quick timeline adjustments without individual step modification.

#### Using bulk deadline adjustment
1. Go to the **Tools** tab.
2. Find the **Adjust Deadlines** section.
3. Choose if you want to add (+) or subtract (-) time.
4. Enter a number.
5. Choose the time unit (minutes, hours, days, weeks, months).
6. Check the boxes next to all the [steps](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) whose deadlines you want to change.
7. Click **UPDATE**.

*Note: This tool changes deadlines based on when the process is [launched](/products/pro/launching/). It doesn't currently let you set deadlines based on when other steps are completed.*

### Template favoriting

Administrators can add a template to other team members' favorites list for them. This also automatically makes those members "watch" the template, so they can get notified about changes.

#### Benefits of template favoriting
- **Help people find templates**: Make important or new templates easier for team members to see and access.
- **Encourage use**: Guide people towards using the correct or preferred templates for consistency.
- **New hires**: Help new team members quickly find the processes they need for faster onboarding.
- **Keep people updated**: Members who favorite (or have favorited for them) can get notified if the template changes.

This feature improves template discovery and ensures important workflows get appropriate attention.

#### Using template favoriting (Administrators only)
1. Go to the **Tools** tab.
2. Find the **Favorite Template** section.
3. Type the names or email addresses of the team [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) you want to add this template as a favorite for. Separate multiple people with commas.
4. Click **Add to Favorites**.
5. The [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) will now show up in those users' "Favorites" tab in their template library. They can then manage their own notification settings for watched templates.

*Learn more about favorites in the [Favorite section guide](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/organize-processes/how-can-i-favorite-and-filter-processes-on-tallyfy/).*

### Best practices for Template Tools
- Always double-check the template after using a bulk tool to make sure it did what you expected and meets requirements.
- Use bulk step creation for setting up standard processes quickly when you have predetermined workflow sequences.
- Use batch assignment when many steps should be done by the same role or person for consistency.
- Use bulk deadlines to set realistic timelines consistently across similar workflow types.
- Use template favoriting to highlight important templates for your team and improve discoverability.

These practices ensure Template Tools improve rather than complicate your workflow management.
