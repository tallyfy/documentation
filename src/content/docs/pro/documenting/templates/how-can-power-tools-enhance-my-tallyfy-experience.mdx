## How can Template Tools enhance faster template editing and management?

Template Tools offer quick ways to make changes to many parts of your template at once, significantly accelerating template development and maintenance. These tools help you build and manage templates faster by automating repetitive tasks.

Template Tools eliminate time-consuming manual processes and enable bulk operations that would otherwise require individual attention to each template element.

### What prerequisites are needed to use Template Tools?
- Access to edit the template you want to change for content modification.
- Permission to edit templates (Standard role with permission, or Administrator role) for security compliance.

These requirements ensure only authorized users can make bulk changes to important workflow templates.

### How can I access the Template Tools interface?
1. Open a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in edit mode.
2. Click **Settings** (or **Config**) in the toolbar at the top.
3. Click the **Tools** tab in the panel that opens.

### How can I add many steps at once using Bulk Step Creation?

Instead of adding steps one by one, you can create many at the same time for efficient template development.

#### Why should I use bulk step creation?
- **Save time**: Add lots of steps in just a few seconds instead of individual creation.
- **Easy copy/paste**: Paste a list of step names from another document or spreadsheet directly.
- **Build faster**: Quickly set up standard process outlines without repetitive clicking.

This approach dramatically reduces template creation time for complex workflows with many steps.

#### How can I implement bulk step creation effectively?
1. Go to the **Tools** tab (in Template Settings).
2. Find the **Create Steps** section.
3. Type or paste your step names into the box. Put each step name on its own line.
4. Click **BUILD**. Tallyfy will add all the steps to your [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in the order you listed them.

### How does Power Builder enable quick process conversion?

When creating a new template, the Power Builder allows you to quickly convert existing process documentation into template steps. This is especially useful if you already have your processes documented in other formats.

#### Why should I use Power Builder for conversion?
- **Convert existing documentation**: Turn documents or spreadsheets with process steps into Tallyfy templates seamlessly.
- **Fast template creation**: Quickly create the structure of a template from listed steps without manual recreation.
- **No retyping needed**: Save time by pasting steps instead of creating them one by one manually.

This tool bridges the gap between existing documentation and digital workflow automation.

#### How can I effectively use Power Builder for conversion?
1. When creating a new template procedure, click on **Power Builder** in the upper right corner.
2. Type or paste your list of steps in the text area. Each step must be on its own line.
3. Click **Build Steps**.
4. Tallyfy will create all the steps in your template in the order you listed them.
5. You can then edit each step to add more details, assignments, deadlines, etc.

### How can I assign many steps at once using Batch Assignment?

Quickly assign multiple steps to the same person or group for efficient workflow distribution.

#### Why should I use batch assignment?
- **Faster assigning**: Assign lots of steps without clicking each one individually, saving significant time.
- **Consistency**: Make sure the right person/group is assigned correctly across many steps for uniform responsibility.
- **Fewer mistakes**: Less chance of forgetting to assign a step due to systematic batch processing.

This approach ensures comprehensive task assignment while reducing administrative overhead.

#### How can I implement batch assignment effectively?
1. Go to the **Tools** tab.
2. Find the **Assign Steps** section.
3. Choose the person or group ([assignee](/products/pro/documenting/members/)) from the dropdown list.
4. Check the boxes next to all the steps you want to assign to them.
5. Click **Assign**.
6. Click **APPLY** to save the assignments.
   *(You can also use this to unassign someone from multiple steps at once.)*

### How can I change many deadlines at once using Bulk Deadline Adjustment?

Change the deadlines for multiple steps at the same time for consistent timeline management.

#### Why should I use bulk deadline adjustment?
- **Manage timing**: Easily set deadlines that are spaced out consistently across workflow steps.
- **Quick updates**: Change timelines quickly if the process requirements need adjustment.
- **Standard timing**: Apply the same deadline rules across similar processes for organizational consistency.

This tool enables rapid timeline adjustments without individual step modification.

#### How can I implement bulk deadline adjustment?
1. Go to the **Tools** tab.
2. Find the **Adjust Deadlines** section.
3. Choose if you want to add (+) or subtract (-) time.
4. Enter a number.
5. Choose the time unit (minutes, hours, days, weeks, months).
6. Check the boxes next to all the [steps](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) whose deadlines you want to change.
7. Click **UPDATE**.

*Note: This tool changes deadlines based on when the process is [launched](/products/pro/launching/). It doesn't currently let you set deadlines based on when other steps are completed.*

### How can I make templates favorites for team members using Template Favoriting?

Administrators can add a template to other team members' favorites list for them. This also automatically makes those members "watch" the template, so they can get notified about changes.

#### Why should I use template favoriting?
- **Help people find templates**: Make important or new templates easier for team members to see and access.
- **Encourage use**: Guide people towards using the correct or preferred templates for consistency.
- **New hires**: Help new team members quickly find the processes they need for faster onboarding.
- **Keep people updated**: Members who favorite (or have favorited for them) can get notified if the template changes.

This feature improves template discoverability and ensures important workflows get appropriate attention.

#### How can I implement template favoriting? (Administrators only)
1. Go to the **Tools** tab.
2. Find the **Favorite Template** section.
3. Type the names or email addresses of the team [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) you want to add this template as a favorite for. Separate multiple people with commas.
4. Click **Add to Favorites**.
5. The [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) will now show up in those users' "Favorites" tab in their template library. They can then manage their own notification settings for watched templates.

*Learn more about favorites in the [Favorite section guide](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/organize-processes/how-can-i-favorite-and-filter-processes-on-tallyfy/).*

### What are best practices for using Template Tools effectively?
- Always double-check the template after using a bulk tool to make sure it did what you expected and meets requirements.
- Use bulk step creation for setting up standard processes quickly when you have predetermined workflow sequences.
- Use batch assignment when many steps should be done by the same role or person for consistency.
- Use bulk deadlines to set realistic timelines consistently across similar workflow types.
- Use template favoriting to highlight important templates for your team and improve discoverability.

These practices ensure Template Tools enhance rather than complicate your workflow management processes.
