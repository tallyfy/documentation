## Template organization fundamentals

Template organization in Tallyfy speeds up workflow discovery by 80%. Traditional training methods fail - people [forget 90% of what they learn within a week](/products/pro/tutorials/why-documentation-training-fails-forgetting-curve/). Use folders, naming conventions, and governance frameworks to keep your templates organized.

### Organization strategies

#### Folder structures

Folder strategies that reduce template search time by 70%:

- **Department-based organization**: Create folders for each department (HR, Finance, Operations)
- **Process type organization**: Group by process type (Approvals, Onboarding, Reviews)
- **Frequency-based organization**: Separate by frequency of use (Daily, Weekly, Monthly)
- **Client-based organization**: For service businesses, organize by client or client type
- **Hybrid approach**: Combine methods with sub-folders (Department > Process Type)

#### Naming conventions

Requirements for consistent template naming:

- **Be descriptive but concise**: Use clear, specific names under 60 characters for better readability in Tallyfy
- **Use prefixes**: Add department or category prefixes (HR-, FIN-, OPS-) for quick identification
- **Include version numbers**: Append version information when appropriate (v2.1) for change tracking
- **Avoid special characters**: Stick to letters, numbers, and hyphens to prevent system issues
- **Consider searchability**: Include keywords that users might search for to improve findability

Example naming pattern: `[Department]-[Process Name]-[Version]`

#### Tagging system

Tags provide an additional organization layer beyond folders:

- Keep your tags consistent across all templates
- Tag things that don't fit neatly into folders (like complexity or approval type)
- Common tag categories include:
  - **Priority**: High, Medium, Low for urgency classification
  - **Complexity**: Simple, Moderate, Complex for skill level requirements
  - **Process Stage**: Planning, Execution, Closing for workflow phases
  - **Approval Type**: Manager, Executive, Client for authorization levels
  - **Time Requirement**: Quick, Standard, Extended for duration expectations

### Process design and step granularity

#### Structuring complex processes (50-100+ steps)

When migrating from detailed checklists or complex procedures with many steps, consider these strategies:

**Step grouping approaches**:
- **Task-based grouping**: Combine related actions into single steps with checklists
  - Instead of: 10 separate steps for document preparation
  - Use: 1 step called "Prepare documents" with a 10-item checklist field[^2]
- **Milestone organization**: Break long processes into logical phases
  - Phase 1: Research (15 steps)
  - Phase 2: Production (30 steps)
  - Phase 3: Review (20 steps)
- **Responsibility clustering**: Group steps by who does them
  - Manager tasks (5 steps combined)
  - Team member tasks (8 steps combined)
  - External vendor tasks (3 steps combined)

**When to use granular steps**:
- Different people handle each step
- Steps happen at different times or locations
- You need separate deadlines per step
- Specific approvals required between steps
- Tracking individual step metrics matters

**When to combine steps**:
- Same person does multiple actions in sequence
- Actions happen together in one sitting
- Steps share the same deadline
- No handoffs between actions
- Steps are quick checkboxes (use checklist field instead)

**Complex process example** (Blog post creation - 75 original steps):
- **Before**: 75 individual steps including "Open document", "Write title", "Check spelling"
- **After**: 12 consolidated steps with checklists:
  1. Research topic (checklist: 8 items)
  2. Create outline (checklist: 5 items)
  3. Write first draft (checklist: 10 items)
  4. Internal review
  5. Revisions (checklist: 6 items)
  6. Final editing
  7. Create graphics
  8. SEO optimization (checklist: 7 items)
  9. Publishing setup
  10. Social media preparation
  11. Schedule publication
  12. Post-publish checks (checklist: 5 items)

### Template governance

#### Access control and permissions

Control who can view, edit, and use templates:

- **Template owners**: Designate specific owners responsible for each template's maintenance and updates
- **Edit permissions**: Limit template editing to certain roles or individuals to prevent unauthorized changes
- **Usage permissions**: Control who can launch processes from templates based on responsibility levels
- **Visibility restrictions**: Make templates visible only to relevant teams to reduce clutter and improve focus
- **Review requirements**: Set up approval workflows for template changes to ensure quality control

:::note[Complete template hiding]
To completely hide a template from Standard and Light users[^1] in the Templates section, you must restrict **ALL THREE** permissions (EDIT, READ, and LAUNCH) for those users. If any single permission remains, the template will still appear in their Templates view.

#### Standardization requirements

Requirements for template consistency:

- **Create template standards**: Define what every template must include
- **Use template components**: Build reusable snippets for common elements
- **Develop style guides**: Document your formatting and content rules
- **Create template templates**: Start new templates from a proven base
- **Regular reviews**: Check templates against your standards every quarter

#### Change management process

Required steps for template changes:

1. **Change request**: Write down what you want to change and why
2. **Impact assessment**: Check how this affects running processes
3. **Approval process**: Get the right people to sign off
4. **Implementation**: Make your changes
5. **Communication**: Tell everyone what changed
6. **Version control**: Keep track of all versions

### Template maintenance

#### Audit schedule

Quarterly template reviews should check:

- **Usage analysis**: Which templates get used? Which don't? Focus on the popular ones
- **Accuracy check**: Do templates match how you actually work now?
- **Compliance verification**: Are you meeting all regulatory requirements?
- **Duplicate identification**: Find and merge templates that do the same thing
- **Orphaned template cleanup**: Archive templates nobody owns anymore

#### Archive management

Archive old templates instead of deleting them:

- **Archive unused templates**: Move outdated templates to an archive folder
- **Document archiving reasons**: Write down why you archived each one
- **Set review dates**: Schedule when to check if archived templates are still needed
- **Maintain access**: Keep archives available to administrators
- **Create archive policies**: Decide when templates get archived (like after 6 months of no use)

#### Template metrics

Key metrics for template health:

- **Template count**: Total number of active templates
- **Template usage rate**: How often each template is used (aim for monthly use minimum)
- **Template effectiveness**: Process completion rates by template (target 95%+)
- **Template feedback**: User ratings and comments
- **Template age**: Time since last update or review (review every 6 months)

- **Change history**: Record of updates and modifications

#### Review schedules
