## Why template organization matters

Good organization in Tallyfy means your team finds the right template in seconds - not minutes. People [forget most of what they learn within a week](/products/pro/tutorials/why-documentation-training-fails-forgetting-curve/), so a well-organized template library becomes their go-to reference.

### Folder structures

Tallyfy supports folders with sub-folders (via parent folders). Pick the strategy that fits your business:

- **By department** - HR, Finance, Operations
- **By process type** - Approvals, Onboarding, Reviews
- **By frequency** - Daily, Weekly, Monthly
- **By client** - For service businesses, organize by client or client type
- **Hybrid** - Combine methods with sub-folders (e.g., Department > Process Type)

### Naming conventions

Keep template names short, clear, and searchable:

- Use specific names under 60 characters
- Add department prefixes (HR-, FIN-, OPS-) for quick scanning
- Append version numbers when needed (v2.1)
- Stick to letters, numbers, and hyphens
- Include keywords people actually search for

Example pattern: `[Department]-[Process Name]-[Version]`

### Tags

Tags give you a second axis of organization beyond folders. You can search, filter, and sort by tags in Tallyfy.

- Keep tags consistent across all templates
- Tag attributes that don't fit into folders - like complexity, priority, or approval type
- Useful tag categories: Priority (High/Medium/Low), Complexity (Simple/Moderate/Complex), Process Stage (Planning/Execution/Closing)

### Step granularity for complex processes

When you're migrating a detailed checklist with 50-100+ steps, don't create a step for every line item. Group them.

**Group steps when**:
- The same person does multiple actions in sequence
- Actions happen in one sitting with a shared deadline
- Steps are quick checkboxes - use a checklist field[^2] instead

**Keep steps separate when**:
- Different people handle each step
- Steps happen at different times
- You need separate deadlines or approvals between steps

**Example** - Blog post creation (75 original steps collapsed to 12):
1. Research topic (checklist: 8 items)
2. Create outline (checklist: 5 items)
3. Write first draft (checklist: 10 items)
4. Internal review
5. Revisions (checklist: 6 items)
6. Final editing
7. Create graphics
8. SEO setup (checklist: 7 items)
9. Publishing setup
10. Social media prep
11. Schedule publication
12. Post-publish checks (checklist: 5 items)

### Permissions and access control

Tallyfy has five template-level permissions: Read, Edit, Launch, Duplicate, and Process Read. Admin users always see all templates.

:::note[Complete template hiding]
To completely hide a template from Standard and Light users[^1] in the Templates section, you must restrict **ALL THREE** permissions (EDIT, READ, and LAUNCH) for those users. If any single permission remains, the template will still appear in their Templates view.

### Change management

When modifying a template that's already in use:

1. **Request** - Document what you want to change and why
2. **Impact check** - Will this affect running processes?
3. **Approval** - Get sign-off from the template owner
4. **Update** - Make the changes
5. **Notify** - Tell affected team members
6. **Version** - Track the change history

### Maintenance and audits

Review templates quarterly. Check for:

- **Usage** - Which templates get used? Archive the ones nobody touches
- **Accuracy** - Do steps still match how work actually gets done?
- **Duplicates** - Merge templates that do the same thing
- **Orphans** - Reassign or archive templates with no owner

Archive old templates instead of deleting them. Keep a note on why each was archived and when to re-check.
