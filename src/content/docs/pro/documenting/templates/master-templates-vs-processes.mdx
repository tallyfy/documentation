title: Master templates vs. launched processes - Understanding the difference
---

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Single source of truth architecture

Master templates in Tallyfy act as your single source of truth - one authoritative version that generates customized processes. Unlike managing multiple document copies where version control becomes a nightmare, updates to the master template ensure consistency while preserving the flexibility of individual process instances.

Think of it like a cookie cutter (master template) and the cookies you make (launched processes) - standardized shape, but each can be decorated differently.

## Key distinctions explained

### Master templates (blueprints)
- **Purpose**: Define the standard process structure and rules
- **Editing**: Only authorized template editors can modify
- **Content**: Contains placeholders, automation rules, and standard text
- **Versions**: Maintains revision history for compliance
- **Location**: Found in Templates section of Tallyfy

### Launched processes (active instances)
- **Purpose**: Execute the actual work with real data
- **Editing**: Users fill in fields and complete tasks
- **Content**: Contains actual client names, dates, and specific information
- **Status**: Tracks progress through active workflow
- **Location**: Found in Processes section of Tallyfy

## How customization works

### At the template level
Templates define what can and cannot be customized in each launched process:

<Steps>
1. **Set field permissions**: Mark fields as editable or read-only
2. **Define conditional paths**: Create IF-THEN rules for dynamic workflows
3. **Establish automation**: Set up rules for assignments and deadlines
4. **Lock standard content**: Protect compliance text and procedures
</Steps>

### At the process level
When users launch a process from a template:

<Steps>
1. **Fill in specific data**: Client names, project details, dates
2. **Activate conditional paths**: Selections determine which tasks appear
3. **Customize allowed sections**: Edit fields marked as editable
4. **Maintain unique timeline**: Each process has its own deadlines
</Steps>

## Real-world example - Global consulting firm

**Challenge**: CBRE manages hundreds of playbooks with multiple variations:
- Agency vs. Principal delivery models
- Different service types (fleet, workplace, on-the-go)
- Regional requirements (North America, Europe, Asia)

**Traditional approach problems**:
- 100+ PowerPoint files with slight variations
- Manual updates to each file when standards change
- Version control nightmare with local copies
- No way to filter content dynamically

**Tallyfy solution**:
- One master template with all variations
- Dynamic filtering based on user selections
- Instant updates when standards change
- Each launched process shows only relevant content

## Benefits over document-based systems

| Traditional Documents | Tallyfy Templates |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| 100 copies of same SOP | 1 master template |
| Manual version tracking | Automatic versioning |
| Update each copy separately | Update master once |
| Static content for all | Dynamic, filtered content |
| Lost customizations in updates | Preserved instance data |
| Email chains for status | Real-time progress tracking |
| Scattered feedback | Centralized comments |

## Common misconceptions clarified

### "Can I edit the template while a process is running?"
Yes, but changes only affect future launched processes. Running processes continue with the version they started with, ensuring consistency.

### "If I update a template, will running processes break?"
No. Running processes maintain their original structure. This protects in-flight work while allowing continuous improvement.

### "Can different teams have different versions?"
Instead of versions, use conditional logic. One template can show different content based on team, region, or any other criteria.

### "How do I manage 12+ variations?"
Use conditional visibility and dynamic fields rather than creating 12 separate templates. One smart template replaces dozens of static documents.

## Implementation best practices

### 1. Design for reusability
- Identify common elements across all variations
- Use [snippets](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/) for repeated content
- Build in flexibility with [variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/)

### 2. Plan your customization strategy
- Decide what users can change vs. what stays locked
- Use form fields to capture variation needs
- Set up automation rules for different paths

### 3. Test before full rollout
- Launch test processes for each major variation
- Verify conditional logic works correctly
- Gather feedback from pilot users

### 4. Maintain the master
- Regular reviews of the master template
- Update based on process feedback
- Version documentation for major changes

## Migration tip for enterprises

When moving from multiple documents to Tallyfy:

<Steps>
1. **Identify commonalities**: Find shared content across all versions
2. **Map variations**: Document what makes each version different
3. **Build smart**: Create one template with conditional logic
4. **Import content**: Use AI import to convert fastest version
5. **Add intelligence**: Layer in automation and conditions
6. **Test thoroughly**: Verify all paths work correctly
7. **Train teams**: Focus on the "why" of single source benefits
</Steps>

## Key takeaway

Master templates provide control and standardization while launched processes deliver flexibility and customization. This architecture eliminates version control chaos while ensuring everyone follows the latest approved procedures - achieving both compliance and agility.
