## Transforming business process documentation

You need consistent processes across your teams - that's where Tallyfy comes in. Instead of static documents that gather dust, you get live workflows through three template types.

Traditional docs get ignored and outdated. Tallyfy's active workflows stay current while giving you real-time tracking, performance data, and ways to improve continuously. Simple.

### Workflow template types

Tallyfy gives you three template types - each one built for different needs:

1. **[Procedure Templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)** - These handle your step-by-step workflows, SOPs, and standard procedures.
   - Perfect when you've got complex processes with steps that depend on each other (think employee onboarding, purchase approvals, compliance procedures).
   - Automation rules let you skip or add steps based on form answers[^1] - the system adapts as you go.
   - Assign [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to specific people ([members](/products/pro/documenting/members/)) or entire teams.
   - Track everything from start to finish. You'll see exactly where each process stands.

2. **[Document Templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/)** - For your policy documents, reference materials, and company procedures.
   - Great for docs that need consistent formatting but flexible content order (social media policies, client guidelines, team protocols, compliance documents - you name it).
   - Set up [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) so team members can fill in specific details while keeping your document structure intact.
   - Lock certain sections that can't change[^2] - keeps you compliant and on-brand.
   - Everyone works online. No downloads needed.

3. **Form Templates** - For collecting business data quickly *(Note: This feature is currently being updated and is unavailable)*
   - Built to gather all your business info in one go - no multi-step hassles.
   - Mix and match question types and form fields to get exactly what you need.
   - Export your collected data for analysis or send it to other systems.
   - Works smoothly with your other workflows.

### Choosing the right template type

Not sure which template to use? Here's how to pick:

#### Choose Procedure Templates when you need to:
  - Track multi-step processes where order matters - step 2 can't happen before step 1
  - Assign different steps to different people, departments, or teams
  - Make sure tasks get done in the right order (especially important for compliance)
  - Keep things moving in a specific sequence from start to finish

#### Choose Document Templates when you need to:
  - Create documents you'll use over and over with the same format
  - Keep formatting consistent but let people customize the details
  - Build reusable templates for contracts, proposals, policies, or standard communications
  - Let your team collaborate on documents while keeping the structure intact

#### Choose Form Templates when you need to:
  - Collect lots of info quickly in one shot
  - Gather specific data, requirements, or feedback in a structured way
  - Create surveys, questionnaires, or data collection forms with different field types
  - Kick off automated workflows based on what people submit
