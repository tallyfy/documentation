## How does Tallyfy transform business process documentation?

Clear business process documentation ensures consistent execution across teams and departments, eliminating variation and improving operational outcomes. Tallyfy<sup>速</sup> transforms traditional static documentation into dynamic, executable workflows through three specialized template types designed for comprehensive business process automation.

Unlike conventional static documents that become outdated and ignored, Tallyfy<sup>速</sup> creates active business process workflows that maintain consistency while enabling real-time tracking, performance analytics, and continuous improvement across organizations.

### What workflow template types does Tallyfy offer?

Tallyfy<sup>速</sup> provides three distinct template types strategically designed for different business process documentation needs, enabling comprehensive workflow automation coverage across all organizational functions:

1. **[Procedure Templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)** - For sophisticated step-by-step business workflows, SOPs, and standard operating procedures.
   - Ideal for complex business processes with multiple interdependent steps following specific sequences (such as employee onboarding workflows, purchase approval processes, compliance procedures).
   - Include advanced automation rules to dynamically skip or add steps based on form responses through conditional workflow logic.
   - Assign specific [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to designated people ([members](/products/pro/documenting/members/)) or cross-functional teams.
   - Enable comprehensive workflow progress tracking from initiation to completion with real-time visibility.

2. **[Document Templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/)** - For standardized business policy documents, reference materials, and organizational procedures.
   - Perfect for standardized business documents requiring consistent formatting where information sequence flexibility is acceptable (including social media policies, client guidelines, team protocols, compliance documents).
   - Configure [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) enabling team members to add specific business details while maintaining document structure.
   - Maintain fixed content sections that remain unchanged to ensure regulatory compliance and brand consistency.
   - Enable online document completion and collaboration without requiring downloads or external software.

3. **Form Templates** - For streamlined business data collection *(Note: This feature is currently being updated and is unavailable)*
   - Designed for collecting comprehensive business information efficiently through single-step data capture processes.
   - Support diverse question types and form fields for sophisticated data gathering requirements.
   - Enable seamless export of collected business data for analysis and integration with external systems.
   - Optimized for streamlined user experience and seamless workflow integration across organizational processes.

### How do I choose the optimal workflow template type?

Selecting the most appropriate template type depends on your specific business process requirements, organizational complexity, and desired operational outcomes:

#### Choose Procedure Templates when you need to:
  - Track sophisticated multi-step business processes with sequential dependencies from initiation to completion
  - Assign different workflow steps to specific team members, departments, or cross-functional teams
  - Ensure prerequisite task completion before subsequent steps can begin for process integrity
  - Maintain strict step sequencing for regulatory compliance or critical process requirements

#### Choose Document Templates when you need to:
  - Create standardized business documents requiring repeated use with consistent professional formatting
  - Maintain document formatting consistency while enabling specific detail customization for individual use cases
  - Build reusable document templates for contracts, proposals, policies, or standardized business communications
  - Enable collaborative team input on standardized document creation while maintaining structural integrity

#### Choose Form Templates when you need to:
  - Collect comprehensive business information efficiently through streamlined single-step data capture
  - Gather specific business data, requirements, or customer feedback through systematic structured approaches
  - Create sophisticated business surveys, questionnaires, or data collection processes with advanced field types
  - Trigger automated workflow sequences based on submitted information and intelligent response analysis
