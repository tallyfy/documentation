## Transforming business process documentation

Clear business process documentation ensures consistent execution across teams and departments, eliminating variation and improving outcomes. Tallyfy transforms traditional static documentation into dynamic, executable workflows through three specialized template types.

Unlike conventional static documents that become outdated and ignored, Tallyfy creates active workflows that maintain consistency while enabling real-time tracking, performance analytics, and continuous improvement.

### Workflow template types

Tallyfy provides three distinct template types designed for different business process documentation needs:

1. **[Procedure Templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)** - For sophisticated step-by-step business workflows, SOPs, and standard operating procedures.
   - Ideal for complex business processes with multiple interdependent steps following specific sequences (such as employee onboarding workflows, purchase approval processes, compliance procedures).
   - Include advanced automation rules to dynamically skip or add steps based on form responses through conditional workflow logic.
   - Assign specific [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to designated people ([members](/products/pro/documenting/members/)) or cross-functional teams.
   - Enable comprehensive workflow progress tracking from initiation to completion with real-time visibility.

2. **[Document Templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/)** - For standardized business policy documents, reference materials, and organizational procedures.
   - Perfect for standardized business documents requiring consistent formatting where information sequence flexibility is acceptable (including social media policies, client guidelines, team protocols, compliance documents).
   - Configure [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) enabling team members to add specific business details while maintaining document structure.
   - Maintain fixed content sections that remain unchanged to ensure regulatory compliance and brand consistency.
   - Enable online document completion and collaboration without requiring downloads or external software.

3. **Form Templates** - For streamlined business data collection *(Note: This feature is currently being updated and is unavailable)*
   - Designed for collecting comprehensive business information efficiently through single-step data capture processes.
   - Support diverse question types and form fields for sophisticated data gathering requirements.
   - Enable seamless export of collected business data for analysis and integration with external systems.
   - Optimized for streamlined user experience and seamless workflow integration across organizational processes.

### Choosing the right template type

Select the right template type based on your specific business process requirements and desired outcomes:

#### Choose Procedure Templates when you need to:
  - Track sophisticated multi-step business processes with sequential dependencies from initiation to completion
  - Assign different workflow steps to specific team members, departments, or cross-functional teams
  - Ensure prerequisite task completion before subsequent steps can begin for process integrity
  - Maintain strict step sequencing for regulatory compliance or critical process requirements

#### Choose Document Templates when you need to:
  - Create standardized business documents requiring repeated use with consistent professional formatting
  - Maintain document formatting consistency while enabling specific detail customization for individual use cases
  - Build reusable document templates for contracts, proposals, policies, or standardized business communications
  - Enable collaborative team input on standardized document creation while maintaining structural integrity

#### Choose Form Templates when you need to:
  - Collect comprehensive business information efficiently through streamlined single-step data capture
  - Gather specific business data, requirements, or customer feedback through systematic structured approaches
  - Create sophisticated business surveys, questionnaires, or data collection processes with advanced field types
  - Trigger automated workflow sequences based on submitted information and intelligent response analysis
