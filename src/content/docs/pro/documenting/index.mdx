## Process documentation in Tallyfy

Writing down your processes clearly helps everyone do things the same way, every time. Tallyfy helps you do this by turning your instructions into repeatable steps using three types of templates.

Instead of static documents, Tallyfy helps you create active processes that keep work consistent across your company.

### Template types overview

Tallyfy offers three ways to set up your templates:

1. **[Procedures](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)** - For step-by-step workflows
   - Use for processes with multiple steps that follow a specific order.
   - Can include rules to skip or add steps based on answers (conditional logic).
   - Assign specific [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to people ([members](/products/pro/documenting/members/)) or teams.
   - Track progress easily from start to finish.

2. **[Documents](/products/pro/documenting/documents/)** - For templates with fill-in-the-blanks
   - Use for standard documents that need consistent formatting.
   - Set up [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) where people can add specific details.
   - Keep some parts fixed so they can't be changed.
   - Complete the document online without downloading.

3. **Forms** - For simple data collection *(Note: This feature is currently being updated and is unavailable)*
   - Use for collecting information in one go.
   - Add different types of questions or fields.
   - Export the collected answers easily.
   - Designed for a simple user experience.

### Choosing the right template type

- Use **Procedures** when you need to:
  - Track a process with several steps all the way through.
  - Give different steps to different people.
  - Make sure some tasks happen only after others are done.
  - Ensure steps are followed in a specific order.

- Use **Documents** when you need to:
  - Create standard business documents that are used often.
  - Keep documents looking the same while letting people fill in specific parts.
  - Make reusable templates for things like contracts or proposals.
  - Work together with others on creating a document.

- Use **Forms** when you need to:
  - Collect information simply, one time.
  - Gather specific details efficiently.
  - Create surveys or questionnaires.
  - Start a process based on the information submitted.
