## How to document your process

The first step for any recurring process is documentation. Tallyfy provides multiple documentation approaches, all called templates.

Tallyfy offers three types of templates:

1. **Procedures** - Step-by-step process workflows
2. **Documents** - Templates with fillable fields that produce customized documents
3. **Forms** - Simple "Submit and Done" data collection *(Currently unavailable during re-engineering)*
