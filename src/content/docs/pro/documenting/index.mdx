## Turning static docs into live workflows

Tallyfy replaces static documents with live workflows through three template types. Instead of docs that gather dust, [process documentation](https://tallyfy.com/process-documentation/) becomes repeatable, trackable work.

You get real-time tracking, performance data, and continuous improvement built in.

### Template types

1. **[Procedure Templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)** - Step-by-step workflows, SOPs, and standard procedures.
   - Best for processes with dependent steps - employee onboarding, purchase approvals, compliance procedures.
   - Automation rules skip or add steps based on form answers[^1].
   - Assign [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to specific [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) or teams.
   - Track progress from start to finish.

2. **[Document Templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/)** - Policy documents, reference materials, and company procedures.
   - Consistent formatting with flexible content - social media policies, client guidelines, team protocols, compliance documents.
   - Add [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) so team members fill in specific details while the document structure stays intact.
   - Lock sections that shouldn't change[^2] - keeps you compliant and on-brand.
   - Everything's online. No downloads needed.

3. **Form Templates** - Structured data collection *(currently being updated - unavailable)*
   - Gather business info in one go, without multi-step processes.
   - Mix question types and form fields for exactly what you need.
   - Export collected data or send it to other systems.

### Which template type to pick

#### Procedure Templates - when you need to:
  - Track multi-step processes where order matters
  - Assign different steps to different people or teams
  - Enforce task completion in sequence (critical for compliance)

#### Document Templates - when you need to:
  - Create reusable documents with consistent formatting
  - Let people customize details within a locked structure
  - Build templates for contracts, proposals, policies, or standard communications

#### Form Templates - when you need to:
  - Collect structured data, requirements, or feedback in one shot
  - Create surveys, questionnaires, or data collection forms
  - Trigger automated workflows from submissions
