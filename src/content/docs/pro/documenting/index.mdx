## Process documentation in Tallyfy

Effective process documentation is the foundation for consistent, repeatable operations. Tallyfy provides three distinct template types to capture and standardize your business processes.

### Template types overview

Tallyfy offers three template formats to address different documentation needs:

1. **Procedures** - Step-by-step process workflows
   - Multi-step sequences with defined order and dependencies
   - Support for conditional logic and branching paths
   - Assignable tasks to specific members or groups
   - Progress tracking from start to completion

2. **Documents** - Templates with editable fields
   - Standardized document structure with consistent formatting
   - Customizable fields for variable information
   - Read-only sections to maintain document integrity
   - Digital completion without downloading

3. **Forms** - Streamlined data collection *(Currently unavailable during re-engineering)*
   - Single-submission data collection
   - Multiple field types for different data needs
   - Exportable responses for analysis
   - Simplified user experience

### Choosing the right template type

- Use **Procedures** when you need:
  - To track a multi-step process through completion
  - To assign different steps to different people
  - To establish dependencies between tasks
  - To ensure a specific sequence of operations

- Use **Documents** when you need:
  - To standardize frequently used business documents
  - To maintain consistency while allowing limited customization
  - To create reusable templates for contracts, proposals, etc.
  - To collaborate on document creation

- Use **Forms** when you need:
  - Simple, one-time data collection
  - To gather structured information efficiently
  - To create surveys or questionnaires
  - To initiate processes based on submitted data
