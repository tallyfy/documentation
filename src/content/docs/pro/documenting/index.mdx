## Business process documentation with Tallyfy<sup>®</sup>

Writing down your business processes clearly helps everyone do things the same way, every time. Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> helps you do this by turning your standard operating procedures into repeatable workflow steps using three types of templates.

Instead of static documents, Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> helps you create active business process workflows that keep work consistent across your company.

### Workflow template types overview

Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> offers three ways to set up your process automation templates:

1. **[Procedures](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)** - For step-by-step business workflows, SOPs, or standard operating procedures.
   - Use for business processes with multiple steps that follow a specific sequence (e.g., employee onboarding workflows, purchase approval processes).
   - Can include automation rules to skip or add steps based on form responses (conditional workflow logic).
   - Assign specific [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to people ([members](/products/pro/documenting/members/)) or teams.
   - Track workflow progress easily from start to finish.

2. **[Documents](/products/pro/documenting/documents/)** - For business policy documents, standard operating procedures, or reference materials.
   - Use for standardized business documents that need consistent formatting but where the information sequence is not critical (e.g., social media policy, client guidelines, team protocols).
   - Set up [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) where people can add specific business details.
   - Keep some content sections fixed so they can't be changed.
   - Complete the document template online without downloading.

3. **Forms** - For simple business data collection *(Note: This feature is currently being updated and is unavailable)*
   - Use for collecting business information efficiently in one step.
   - Add different types of questions or form fields for data capture.
   - Export the collected business data easily.
   - Designed for streamlined user experience and workflow integration.

### Choosing the right workflow template type

- Use **Procedures** when you need to:
  - Track a business process with several sequential steps all the way through.
  - Assign different workflow steps to different team members.
  - Ensure certain tasks happen only after prerequisite steps are completed.
  - Maintain a specific step sequence for process compliance.

- Use **Documents** when you need to:
  - Create standardized business documents that are used repeatedly.
  - Keep document formatting consistent while letting people fill in specific business details.
  - Make reusable document templates for things like contracts or business proposals.
  - Collaborate with team members on creating standardized documents.

- Use **Forms** when you need to:
  - Collect business information efficiently in a single step.
  - Gather specific business data and requirements.
  - Create business surveys or data collection questionnaires.
  - Trigger automated workflows based on the information submitted.
