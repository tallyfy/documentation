## How to document your process

For any recurring process - the very first step is to document that process. Tallyfy covers the full spectrum of types and modes of documentation. All of these master recipes are called templates.

There's three kinds of templates:

1. **Procedures** - Which suit step-by-step processes
2. **Documents** - Which suit document templates where you fill-in-the-blanks to produce your customized version of the document
3. **Forms** - Which suit scenarios where you just submit a form and you're done. We call this "Submit and Done". _At present - Forms are not available as we are re-engineering how they work._
