## Launch a Tallyfy process from an external web form

You can connect an external web form (your website, Typeform, Google Forms, etc.) to Tallyfy so that form submissions trigger a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) launch - with [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) data filled in automatically.

There are two approaches:

1. **Public kick-off form link** - share your template's public kick-off URL so anyone can fill it out and launch a process as a guest.
2. **Magic link with pre-filled fields** - build a URL that pre-fills kick-off form fields for logged-in Tallyfy users, using the `ko_fields` parameter.

### Approach 1 - Public kick-off form link

This is the simplest method. Tallyfy generates a public URL for your template's [kick-off form](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/). Anyone with the link can submit the form and launch a process - no Tallyfy login required.

<Steps>
1. Create a [process template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) with [kick-off form fields](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/).
2. Open the template, go to the kick-off form step, and click **Share**.
3. Copy the public kick-off link. It follows this format:
   `https://go.tallyfy.com/public/library/{orgId}/blueprint/{templateId}/kick-off`
4. Redirect your web form's submit action to this URL, or embed it on your website.
</Steps>

When someone visits the link, Tallyfy asks for their email, then shows the kick-off form. On submission, the process launches automatically.

### Approach 2 - Magic link with pre-filled fields

For logged-in users, you can build a launch URL that pre-fills kick-off form values using the `ko_fields` query parameter. The `ko_fields` value is a JSON-encoded array where each element maps a field alias to its value.

<Steps>
1. Create a template with kick-off form fields. Note each field's **alias** (the internal identifier).
2. Build the launch URL:
   `https://go.tallyfy.com/#/org/{orgId}/process/{templateId}/create?ko_fields={json}&launchprocess=true`
3. The `ko_fields` parameter takes URL-encoded JSON. Each array element is an object like `{"field_alias": "value"}`.
4. Set `launchprocess=true` to auto-launch. You can also set `default_run_name` to pre-fill the process name.
</Steps>

#### Example URL

If your template has kick-off fields with aliases `customer_name` and `customer_email`:

```text
https://go.tallyfy.com/#/org/{orgId}/process/{templateId}/create?ko_fields=[{"customer_name":"John Doe"},{"customer_email":"john@example.com"}]&launchprocess=true
```

:::note
The `ko_fields` approach requires the user to be logged into Tallyfy. For anonymous/guest access, use the public kick-off form link instead.
