## Starting a Tallyfy process from a web form submission

You can set up an external web form (like one on your website, or using a tool like Typeform or Google Forms) so that when someone submits it, a Tallyfy [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) starts automatically, and the answers from the form fill in certain Tallyfy [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/). This saves time by avoiding manual data entry.

### What you need

1. A Tallyfy account where you can launch processes.
2. An external web form that collects information.
3. A Tallyfy [process template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) with [kick-off form fields](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/) that have *exactly* the same names as the fields in your web form (or the names you will send in the URL).

### How to set it up

#### 1. Prepare your Tallyfy Template

<Steps>
1. Design the Tallyfy [process template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) you want to launch.
2. Add [kick-off form fields](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/) to this template to receive the data from your web form.
3. **Crucially**, make sure the internal names of these Tallyfy fields exactly match the names you will send from your web form (e.g., if your web form has a field named `customer_email`, make sure the corresponding Tallyfy kick-off field is also named `customer_email`).
</Steps>

#### 2. Set up the Web Form / Link

The basic idea is to make the "submit" action of your web form redirect the user to a special Tallyfy launch URL, adding the form answers onto the end of the URL.

<Steps>
1. Get the special launch URL for your Tallyfy template. (This is often called a "Kick-off Form Link" or "Public Form Link" - find it in the template's **Triggers** settings).
2. Modify your web form so that when it's submitted, it directs the user to that Tallyfy URL.
3. Add the data from the web form fields onto the end of the URL as "query parameters". The format is `?fieldName1=value1&fieldName2=value2`.
4. **Important**: The `fieldName` parts *must exactly match* the names of the kick-off form fields in your Tallyfy template.
5. **Important**: The `value` parts need to be "URL encoded" if they contain spaces or special characters (e.g., a space becomes `%20`, the `@` symbol becomes `%40`). Most web form tools or simple coding can handle this encoding automatically.
</Steps>

#### Example URL

If your Tallyfy template kick-off link is `https://example.tallyfy.com/launch/xyz` and your template has kick-off fields named `customer_name` and `customer_email`, the final URL your web form should send the user to might look like this:

```
https://example.tallyfy.com/launch/xyz?customer_name=John%20Doe&customer_email=john.doe%40example.com
```

When the user lands on this URL, Tallyfy will automatically start the process and pre-fill the "customer_name" field with "John Doe" and the "customer_email" field with "john.doe@example.com".
