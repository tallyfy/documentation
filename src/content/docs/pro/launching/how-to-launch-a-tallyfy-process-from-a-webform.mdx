## Populating process fields from web form data

Tallyfy allows you to launch processes and automatically populate their fields using data submitted through web forms. This integration streamlines workflow initiation by eliminating manual data entry.

## Prerequisites

To use this feature, you need:

1. A Tallyfy account with permission to launch processes
2. A web form to collect user input data
3. A process template with matching field names

## Implementation process

### Creating the process template

Before establishing the web form connection:

1. Design your process template in Tallyfy
2. Create kickoff form fields to store incoming data
3. Ensure field names match the parameters you'll pass from the web form

### Configuring the web form integration

To enable web form data population:

1. Generate a process launch URL (available in your process settings)
2. Append query parameters to this URL using the format: `?field_name=field_value`
3. URL-encode values containing spaces or special characters

### Example implementation

For a process with a field named "customer_name" that you want to populate with "John Doe":

```
https://example.tallyfy.com/process-webform?customer_name=John%20Doe
```

Multiple fields can be populated by adding more parameters:

```
https://example.tallyfy.com/process-webform?customer_name=John%20Doe&customer_email=john.doe%40example.com
```

When a user submits the web form, Tallyfy creates a new process instance with pre-populated fields matching the provided parameter values.
