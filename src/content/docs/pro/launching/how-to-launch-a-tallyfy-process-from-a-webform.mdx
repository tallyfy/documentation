## Starting a Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> process from a web form submission

You can set up an external web form (like on your website, or using Typeform or Google Forms) so that when someone submits it, a Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) starts automatically, and answers from the form fill in specific Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/). This saves time and avoids manual data entry.

### What you need

*   A Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> account with permission to launch processes.
*   An external web form (e.g., Typeform, Google Forms, your website form).
*   A Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> [process template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) with [kick-off form fields](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/) that have the *exact* same internal names as the fields in your web form (or the names you will send in the URL parameters).

### How to set it up

#### 1. Prepare your Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> template

<Steps>
1. Design the Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> [process template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) you want the web form to launch.
2. Add [kick-off form fields](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/) to this template to capture the data from your web form.
3. **Important:** Make sure the internal names of these Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> fields exactly match the field names you'll send from your web form (e.g., if your web form field is named `customer_email`, the corresponding Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> kick-off field must also be named `customer_email`).
</Steps>

#### 2. Set up the web form / link

The goal is to make your web form's "submit" action redirect the user to a special Tallyfy launch URL, adding the form answers to the end of the URL.

<Steps>
1. Get the launch URL for your Tallyfy template (often called a "Kick-off Form Link" or "Public Form Link"). Find it in the template's **Triggers** settings.
2. Modify your web form so that upon submission, it sends the user to that Tallyfy URL.
3. Append the data from the web form fields to the end of the URL as query parameters. The format is `?fieldName1=value1&fieldName2=value2`.
4. **Important**: The `fieldName` parts *must exactly match* the internal names of the kick-off form fields in your Tallyfy template.
5. **Important**: The `value` parts need to be URL-encoded if they contain spaces or special characters (e.g., a space becomes `%20`, the `@` symbol becomes `%40`). Most web form tools or simple scripts handle URL encoding automatically.
</Steps>

#### Example URL

If your Tallyfy template kick-off link is `https://example.tallyfy.com/launch/xyz` and your template has kick-off fields named `customer_name` and `customer_email`, the final URL your web form should send the user to might look like:

```text
https://example.tallyfy.com/launch/xyz?customer_name=John%20Doe&customer_email=john.doe%40example.com
```

When the user visits this URL, Tallyfy will automatically start the process and pre-fill the `customer_name` field with "John Doe" and the `customer_email` field with "john.doe@example.com".
