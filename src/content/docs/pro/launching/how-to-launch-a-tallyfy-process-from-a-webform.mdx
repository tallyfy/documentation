## Populating process fields from web form data

Tallyfy allows you to [launch](/products/pro/launching/) [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) and automatically populate their [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) using data submitted through web forms. This [integration](/products/pro/integrations/) streamlines workflow initiation by eliminating manual data entry.

### Requirements

To use this feature, you need:

1. A Tallyfy account with permission to [launch processes](/products/pro/launching/)
2. A web form to collect user input data
3. A [process template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) with matching field names

### Implementation process

#### Creating the Process template

Before establishing the web form connection:

<Steps>
1. Design your [process template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in Tallyfy
2. Create [kickoff form fields](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/) to store incoming data
3. Ensure field names match the parameters you'll pass from the web form
</Steps>

#### Configuring the web form integration

To enable web form data population:

<Steps>
1. Generate a process launch URL (available in your process settings)
2. Append query parameters to this URL using the format: `?field_name=field_value`
3. URL-encode values containing spaces or special characters
</Steps>

#### Example implementation

For a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) with a [field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) named "customer_name" that you want to populate with "John Doe":

```
https://example.tallyfy.com/process-webform?customer_name=John%20Doe
```

Multiple fields can be populated by adding more parameters:

```
https://example.tallyfy.com/process-webform?customer_name=John%20Doe&customer_email=john.doe%40example.com
```

When a user submits the web form, Tallyfy creates a new [process instance](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) with pre-populated [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) matching the provided parameter values.
