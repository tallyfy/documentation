## Customizing process details during launch

Tallyfy allows you to modify key [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) parameters before finalizing the [launch](/products/pro/launching/). This feature is useful for adapting [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) defaults to specific circumstances.

## Editable elements

The following elements can be adjusted during the launch process:

* Process name
* [Task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) assignees
* Task deadlines
* [Guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) participants

## Editing procedure

To customize a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) during launch:

<Steps>
1. Select the desired [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)
2. Click the **Launch** button
3. In the launch dialog, modify any of the editable elements
4. Confirm your changes to initiate the process
</Steps>

These modifications affect only this specific process instance and do not alter the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) itself.
