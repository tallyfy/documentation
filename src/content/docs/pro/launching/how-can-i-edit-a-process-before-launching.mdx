## Customizing a process before launching it

When you [launch](/products/pro/launching/) a process from a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), Tallyfy lets you make changes specific to *this* instance of the process, without affecting the original template.

### What you can change before launching

On the launch screen, you can usually adjust:

*   **Process name**: Give this instance a unique name (e.g., "Onboard John Smith" instead of just "Employee Onboarding").
*   **[Task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) assignees**: Change task assignments for this instance.
*   **Task deadlines**: Adjust task deadlines for this instance.
*   **[Guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) details**: Add or update guest email addresses if the template uses guest assignments.

### How to edit before launching

<Steps>
1. Choose the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) you want to launch.
2. Click the **Launch** button.
3. The launch screen appears, showing process details.
4. On this screen, make any desired changes to the process name, task assignments, deadlines, or guest information.
5. Check your changes and click the final **Launch** button to start the customized process.
</Steps>

Remember, these changes only affect the process you are launching now. The original template is unchanged for future use.
