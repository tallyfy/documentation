## Customizing a process before launching it

When you [launch](/products/pro/launching/) a process from a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), Tallyfy gives you a chance to make changes specific to *this* run of the process, without changing the original template.

### What you can change before launching

In the launch confirmation screen, you can usually adjust:

*   **Process name**: Give this specific run a unique name (e.g., "Onboard John Smith" instead of just "Employee Onboarding").
*   **[Task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) assignees**: Change who is assigned to specific tasks for this run.
*   **Task deadlines**: Adjust due dates for specific tasks for this run.
*   **[Guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) details**: Add or confirm guest email addresses if the template uses guest assignments.

### How to edit before launching

<Steps>
1. Choose the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) you want to start.
2. Click the **Launch** button.
3. A confirmation screen appears, showing the process details.
4. On this screen, make any needed changes to the process name, task assignments, deadlines, or guest information.
5. Review your changes and click the final **Launch** button to start the process with your adjustments.
</Steps>

Remember, these changes only affect the process instance you are launching right now. The original template remains unchanged for future launches.
