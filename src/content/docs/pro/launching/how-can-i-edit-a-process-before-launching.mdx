## How can I edit a process before launching in Tallyfy?

When [launching](/products/pro/launching/) processes from [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), Tallyfy<sup>Â®</sup> enables instance-specific customizations without modifying the original template structure.

This pre-launch customization capability ensures each process instance can be tailored to specific requirements while preserving template integrity for future use across different scenarios and team members.

### What elements can I customize before launching processes?

The launch screen provides comprehensive customization options enabling process personalization for specific execution requirements:

*   **Process name**: Give this instance a unique name (e.g., "Onboard John Smith" instead of just "Employee Onboarding").
*   **[Task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) assignees**: Change task assignments for this instance.
*   **Task deadlines**: Adjust task deadlines for this instance.
*   **[Guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) details**: Add or update guest email addresses if the template uses guest assignments.

### How to edit before launching

<Steps>
1. Choose the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) you want to launch.
2. Click the **Launch** button.
3. The launch screen appears, showing process details.
4. On this screen, make any desired changes to the process name, task assignments, deadlines, or guest information.
5. Check your changes and click the final **Launch** button to start the customized process.
</Steps>

:::tip[Tip for testing]
If you want to test a process without sending notifications to the usual assignees, use this screen to temporarily assign all tasks to yourself. This lets you run through the process steps without bothering your team.
:::

Remember, these changes only affect the process you are launching now. The original template is unchanged for future use.
