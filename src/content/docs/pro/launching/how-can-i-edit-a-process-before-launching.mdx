## How can I edit a process before launching in Tallyfy?

When [launching](/products/pro/launching/) Tallyfy processes from [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), the platform enables instance-specific customizations without modifying the original template structure.

This pre-launch customization capability ensures each Tallyfy process instance can be tailored to specific requirements while preserving template integrity for future use.

### What elements can I customize before launching processes?

The launch screen provides comprehensive customization options enabling process personalization for specific execution requirements:

*   **Process name**: Give this instance a unique name (e.g., "Onboard John Smith" instead of just "Employee Onboarding").
*   **[Task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) assignees**: Change task assignments for this instance.
*   **Task deadlines**: Adjust task deadlines for this instance.
*   **[Guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) details**: Add or update guest email addresses if the template uses guest assignments.

:::tip[Auto-naming for consistent process names]
Instead of manually naming each process, you can [set up auto-naming](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/edit-processes/how-can-i-auto-name-a-process-in-tallyfy/) to rename the project with values input in the fields automatically. This creates dynamic project names that pull data directly from your required kick-off form fields, ensuring consistent naming without manual effort.

:::tip[Tip for testing]
If you want to test a process without sending notifications to the usual assignees, use this screen to temporarily assign all tasks to yourself. This lets you run through the process steps without bothering your team.

Remember, these changes only affect the process you are launching now. The original template is unchanged for future use.
