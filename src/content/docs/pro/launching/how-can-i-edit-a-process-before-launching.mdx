## How can I edit a process before launching in Tallyfy?

You can customize each process instance during launch - changing names, assignees, deadlines, and more - without touching the original [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).

### What can you customize before launching?

Tallyfy's launch wizard walks you through several steps. Depending on your template's settings, you'll see some or all of these:

*   **Process name**: Give this instance a unique name (e.g., "Onboard John Smith" instead of just "Employee Onboarding"). Names can be up to 550 characters.
*   **[Task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) assignees**: Change who's assigned to each task for this instance.
*   **Task deadlines**: Adjust individual task deadlines.
*   **[Guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) emails**: Add or update guest email addresses if the template uses guest assignments.
*   **Roles**: Assign people or groups to roles defined in the template.
*   **Kick-off form fields**: Fill in any required kick-off form data before the process starts.
*   **Tags and folders**: Categorize the process if the template requires tagging or folder placement.

:::tip[Auto-naming for consistent process names]
You can [set up auto-naming](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/edit-processes/how-can-i-auto-name-a-process-in-tallyfy/) to generate process names automatically from kick-off form field values. If auto-naming is on and the template doesn't allow name changes, the name step is skipped entirely.

### How to edit before launching

<Steps>
1. Choose the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) you want to launch.
2. Click the **Launch** button.
3. Tallyfy walks you through a multi-step wizard - process instructions, kick-off form, process name, roles, and metadata depending on your template setup.
4. Make any changes to assignees, deadlines, or guest information on each step.
5. Review your changes on the final step, then click the **Launch** button to start the process.
</Steps>

:::tip[Tip for testing]
To test a process without notifying the usual assignees, assign all tasks to yourself on the launch screen. This lets you run through every step without bothering your team.

These changes only affect the process you're launching now. The original template stays unchanged.
