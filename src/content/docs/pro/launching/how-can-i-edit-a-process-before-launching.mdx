## Customizing process details during launch

Tallyfy allows you to modify key process parameters before finalizing the launch. This feature is useful for adapting template defaults to specific circumstances.

## Editable elements

The following elements can be adjusted during the launch process:

* Process name
* Task assignees
* Task deadlines
* Guest participants

## Editing procedure

To customize a process during launch:

1. Select the desired template
2. Click the **Launch** button
3. In the launch dialog, modify any of the editable elements
4. Confirm your changes to initiate the process

These modifications affect only this specific process instance and do not alter the template itself.
