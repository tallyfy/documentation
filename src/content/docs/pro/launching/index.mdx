## Understanding process launching

[Launching](/products/pro/launching/) a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) creates an active workflow instance from a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). This operation generates a configured copy of the template designed for a specific business scenario.

## Templates vs. processes

[Templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) serve as reusable blueprints for your standard workflows. Think of a template like a **master blueprint** for building a house.

[Launching](/products/pro/launching/) a template creates a **process** â€“ a unique, active instance of that workflow, much like using the blueprint to start **building a specific house**. Each process represents a distinct application of the template pattern, needing its own unique identifier or name.

* **Template**: The master blueprint (e.g., the standard "Client Onboarding" workflow).
* **Process**: A specific house being built using that blueprint (e.g., the specific "Coca-Cola Client Onboarding" process, launched on October 26th). This specific instance needs a unique name to distinguish it from other onboarding processes run from the same template.

## Key concepts

### Independent configuration

When you modify a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), the changes only affect [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) launched after those modifications. Existing processes retain their original configuration, ensuring workflow consistency for in-progress items.

:::tip[Adapt processes with ad-hoc tasks]
Launched [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) can be enhanced with additional ad-hoc one-off [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) at any time. You're not limited to just the tasks defined in the template - you can add approval tasks, email tasks, or any other task type to address specific needs of that process instance.

### Launch methods

Tallyfy provides multiple methods to [launch processes](/products/pro/launching/):

* Manual launch from the template library
* Automated triggers ([API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/), [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/), scheduled events)
* [Task completion triggers](/products/pro/launching/launch-process-when-task-is-completed/) from other processes
* Web form [integration](/products/pro/integrations/)
* [Email-based triggers](/products/pro/launching/triggers/via-email/)
* [Magic links](/products/pro/launching/triggers/magic-links/) for external participants

### Process customization

During [launch](/products/pro/launching/), you can customize:
* Process name
* [Task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) assignees
* Deadlines
* [Guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) participants
* Initial [form data](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/)
