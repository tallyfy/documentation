## Understanding process launching

Launching a process creates an active workflow instance from a template. This operation generates a configured copy of the template designed for a specific business scenario.

## Templates vs. processes

Templates serve as reusable blueprints that can initiate multiple processes. Each process represents a unique application of the template pattern:

* **Template**: The master pattern defining workflow structure (e.g., "Client Onboarding")
* **Process**: A specific instance with unique data and participants (e.g., "Coca Cola" client onboarding)

## Key concepts

### Independent configuration

When you modify a template, the changes only affect processes launched after those modifications. Existing processes retain their original configuration, ensuring workflow consistency for in-progress items.

:::tip[Adapt processes with ad-hoc tasks]
Launched processes can be enhanced with additional ad-hoc one-off tasks at any time. You're not limited to just the tasks defined in the template - you can add approval tasks, email tasks, or any other task type to address specific needs of that process instance.

### Launch methods

Tallyfy provides multiple methods to launch processes:

* Manual launch from the template library
* Automated triggers (API, webhooks, scheduled events)
* Task completion triggers from other processes
* Web form integration
* Email-based triggers
* Magic links for external participants

### Process customization

During launch, you can customize:
* Process name
* Task assignees
* Deadlines
* Guest participants
* Initial form data
