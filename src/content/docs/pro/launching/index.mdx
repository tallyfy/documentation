## Understanding process launching

**Launching** a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) in Tallyfy means starting an active workflow based on a saved [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). Think of the template as a blueprint and the process as the specific project started from that blueprint.

### Why process launching matters

Process launching is the critical step that transforms your static template into actionable work. Without a proper launch system, workflows remain theoretical or exist only as documentation. Effective launching ensures the right people receive their assignments at the right time, with the correct data and deadlines. It's the bridge between planning and execution that makes your workflow management truly operational rather than just documented.

### Template vs. process: What's the difference?

It's important to know the difference:

*   A **[Template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)** is the reusable master design for your workflow (e.g., the standard "Client Onboarding" steps).
*   A **Process** is a *single, specific instance* of that workflow being run for a specific case (e.g., the "Coca-Cola Client Onboarding" process that started today). Each process needs a unique name so you can track it.

:::note[Template vs. blueprint]
In the Tallyfy app, we use the term **Template**. In the technical API documentation, the same concept is called a **Blueprint**.
:::

You launch a process every time you need to run the workflow from a template, whether it's for a large company process or a simple team checklist.

### Key things to know about launching

#### Launched processes are independent
When you change a template, those changes **only affect future processes** launched *after* the change. Any processes already running will continue based on the version of the template they were launched from. This keeps current work consistent.

:::tip[Adding tasks to running processes]
You can always add extra one-off [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to a process *after* it has launched. You aren't limited to the steps defined in the original template.

#### Ways to launch a process
Tallyfy offers several ways to start a process:

*   [Manually launching](/products/pro/launching/how-can-i-launch-a-process-in-tallyfy/) from the template library.
*   Automatically using triggers like the [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/), [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/), or a schedule via [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/).
*   Automatically when a [task in another process is completed](/products/pro/launching/launch-process-when-task-is-completed/).
*   From a [web form submission](/products/pro/launching/how-to-launch-a-tallyfy-process-from-a-webform/).
*   By sending an [email](/products/pro/launching/triggers/via-email/).
*   Using special [magic links](/products/pro/launching/triggers/magic-links/).

#### Customizing at launch
When you launch a process (especially manually), you can often customize details for that specific instance:
*   Set a unique process name.
*   Change who [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) are assigned to.
*   Adjust deadlines.
*   Add [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) participants.
*   Fill in the [kick-off form](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/).
