## Understanding process launching

**Launching** a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) in Tallyfy means starting an active workflow based on a saved [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). Think of the template as a blueprint and the process as the specific project started from that blueprint.

### Template vs. process: What's the difference?

It's important to know the difference:

*   A **[Template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)** is the reusable master design for your workflow (e.g., the standard "Client Onboarding" steps).
*   A **Process** is a *single, specific instance* of that workflow being run for a specific case (e.g., the "Coca-Cola Client Onboarding" process that started today). Each process needs a unique name so you can track it.

:::note[Template vs. blueprint]
In the Tallyfy app, we use the term **Template**. In the technical API documentation, the same concept is called a **Blueprint**.
:::

You launch a process every time you need to run the workflow from a template, whether it's for a large company process or a simple team checklist.

### Key things to know about launching

#### Launched processes are independent
When you change a template, those changes **only affect future processes** launched *after* the change. Any processes already running will continue based on the version of the template they were launched from. This keeps current work consistent.

:::tip[Adding tasks to running processes]
You can always add extra one-off [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to a process *after* it has launched. You aren't limited to the steps defined in the original template.

#### Ways to launch a process
Tallyfy offers several ways to start a process:

*   [Manually launching](/products/pro/launching/how-can-i-launch-a-process-in-tallyfy/) from the template library.
*   Automatically using triggers like the [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/), [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/), or a schedule via [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/).
*   Automatically when a [task in another process is completed](/products/pro/launching/launch-process-when-task-is-completed/).
*   From a [web form submission](/products/pro/launching/how-to-launch-a-tallyfy-process-from-a-webform/).
*   By sending an [email](/products/pro/launching/triggers/via-email/).
*   Using special [magic links](/products/pro/launching/triggers/magic-links/).

#### Customizing at launch
When you launch a process (especially manually), you can often customize details for that specific instance:
*   Set a unique process name.
*   Change who [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) are assigned to.
*   Adjust deadlines.
*   Add [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) participants.
*   Fill in the [kick-off form](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/).
