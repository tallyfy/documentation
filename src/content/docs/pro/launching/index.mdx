## How does process launching work in Tallyfy for workflow execution?

Process launching in Tallyfy transforms static workflow templates into active, trackable processes with specific assignments and deadlines.

Think of templates as reusable blueprints and launched processes as specific project instances executing those blueprint instructions. Each launched process operates independently with its own timeline, participants, and progress tracking.

This transformation lets organizations move from workflow planning to actual work execution with complete accountability.

### Why is process launching essential for organizational workflow success?

Process launching is the critical transformation point where theoretical workflow templates become actionable business processes that generate real organizational value.

Without systematic launching, workflows stay as static documentation rather than dynamic operational tools. Effective process launching makes sure appropriate task assignments reach designated team members at the right time with complete contextual information.

Process launching bridges strategic workflow planning with tactical execution, making workflow management a measurable business reality that drives operational excellence.

### What key distinctions exist between templates and processes?

Understanding the fundamental distinction between templates and processes remains essential for effective workflow management:

*   **Templates** serve as reusable master workflow designs containing standardized step sequences (e.g., the standard "Client Onboarding" procedure template)
*   **Processes** represent individual, specific workflow instances executing template instructions for particular cases (e.g., the "Coca-Cola Client Onboarding" process launched today)

Each process requires a unique identifying name enabling precise tracking, progress monitoring, and performance analysis across multiple concurrent workflow executions.

This distinction ensures scalable workflow management while maintaining individual process accountability.

:::note[Template vs. blueprint]
In the Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> app, we use the term **Template**. In the technical API documentation, the same concept is called a **Blueprint**.

You launch a process every time you need to run the workflow from a template, whether it's for a large company process or a simple team checklist.

### What essential concepts should I understand about process launching?

#### How do launched processes maintain independence from template changes?
Template modifications exclusively affect future processes launched after implementing changes, ensuring workflow consistency and predictability.

Currently executing processes continue operating based on their original template version, maintaining work continuity and preventing mid-process disruptions. This independence model protects active workflows from unintended template changes while enabling continuous template improvement.

:::tip[Adding tasks to running processes]
You can always add extra one-off [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to a process *after* it has launched. You aren't limited to the steps defined in the original template.

#### What methods are available for launching Tallyfy processes?
Tallyfy® provides multiple process launching methods accommodating diverse organizational workflows and automation requirements:

*   **Manual launching** directly from the template library interface for immediate workflow initiation
*   **Automatic triggers** including API calls, webhooks, or scheduled automation via middleware for hands-off operation
*   **Cascade launching** when tasks in other processes complete for workflow chaining
*   **Web form integration** through form submissions for external data-driven initiation
*   **Email triggers** by sending messages to designated email addresses for convenient mobile launching
*   **Magic links** enabling external stakeholder process initiation without login requirements

These diverse launching methods ensure workflows can be initiated through the most appropriate channel for each business scenario.

#### How can I customize processes during launch for specific requirements?
When you launch a process (especially manually), you can customize details for that specific instance:
*   Set a unique process name for clear identification and tracking.
*   Change who tasks are assigned to based on current availability and expertise.
*   Adjust deadlines to accommodate specific project timelines and constraints.
*   Add guest participants for external collaboration and stakeholder involvement.
*   Fill in the kick-off form with relevant data and context for the specific workflow instance.

This customization capability ensures each process instance can be tailored to specific business needs while maintaining the underlying workflow structure.
