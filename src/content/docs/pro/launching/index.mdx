## Process launching in Tallyfy

Launching transforms templates into active, trackable processes with specific assignments and deadlines. When you launch a process, you create a running instance that team members work on.

Templates are reusable blueprints. Launched processes are specific instances executing those instructions. Each process operates independently with its own timeline, participants, and progress tracking.

### Why use process launching?

Launching turns documented procedures into active work with tracking and accountability. Task assignments reach team members at the right time with context.

### Templates vs. processes

*   **Templates** - Reusable master workflow designs with standardized step sequences (e.g., "Client Onboarding" template)
*   **Processes** - Individual workflow instances executing template instructions for specific cases (e.g., "Coca-Cola Client Onboarding" launched today)

Each process needs a unique name for tracking and monitoring multiple concurrent executions.

:::note[Template vs. blueprint]
In the Tallyfy app, we use the term **Template**. In the technical API documentation, the same concept is called a **Blueprint**.
:::

Launch a process every time you need to run the workflow from a template.

### Key concepts

#### Process independence from template changes
Template modifications only affect future launches. Running processes continue with their original instructions - they won't change mid-flight. This protects active workflows while enabling continuous template improvement.

:::tip[Adding tasks to running processes]
You can always add extra one-off [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to a process *after* it has launched. You aren't limited to the steps defined in the original template.
:::

#### Launch methods

*   **Manual launching** - From the Templates interface
*   **Automatic triggers** - API calls, webhooks, or scheduled automation
*   **Cascade launching** - When tasks in other processes complete
*   **Web form integration** - Through form submissions
*   **Email triggers** - Send messages to designated addresses
*   **Magic links** - External stakeholders can initiate without login

#### How launch methods work together

This diagram shows how all launch methods converge to create an active process from a template.

  }
  Magic: Magic Link {
    style.fill: "#e1f7e6"
    style.stroke: "#225930"
  }
}

# Result

  shape: circle
  style.fill: "#f2faf4"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.stroke-width: 2
}

# Connections

  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.stroke-width: 2
}
Launch Methods.Manual -> Process: Launch {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}
Launch Methods.API -> Process: Launch {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}
Launch Methods.Task -> Process: Launch {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}
Launch Methods.Form -> Process: Launch {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}
Launch Methods.Email -> Process: Launch {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}
Launch Methods.Magic -> Process: Launch {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}
```

**What to notice:**
- All six launch methods lead to the same outcome - an active process instance
- Every launch method allows optional customization before the process starts
- The template remains unchanged while each process runs independently with its own timeline

#### Customization during launch
When launching a process, you can:
*   Set a unique process name
*   Change task assignments
*   Adjust deadlines
*   Add guest participants
*   Fill in the kick-off form with relevant data

Alternatively, [set up auto-naming](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/edit-processes/how-can-i-auto-name-a-process-in-tallyfy/) to automatically generate process names from kick-off form field values.
