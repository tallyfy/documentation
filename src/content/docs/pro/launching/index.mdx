## Launching is ridiculously fun!

Launching a process involves grabbing a copy of template and running it for a specific situation.

You are taking the template (recipe) and copying it for a specific scenario at the moment you launch it.

One template can have many processes. An example of a template is "Client Onboarding" and an example of a process that uses that template is "Coca Cola". In other words - we're running the process "Coca Cola" using the template "Client Onboarding".

If you make changes to a template, they only reflect on the next process you launch.
