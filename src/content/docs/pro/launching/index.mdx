## Process launching in Tallyfy

Launching turns a template into a live, trackable process with assignments and deadlines. Each launched process runs independently - its own timeline, participants, and progress.

Templates are reusable blueprints. Processes are specific instances of those blueprints. Think of it like printing a document - the file stays the same, but each printout lives on its own.

### Templates vs. processes

*   **Templates** - Reusable workflow designs with standardized steps (e.g., "Client Onboarding" template)
*   **Processes** - Running instances for specific cases (e.g., "Coca-Cola Client Onboarding" launched today)

Give each process a descriptive name so you can track multiple running instances at a glance.

:::note[Template vs. blueprint]
In the Tallyfy app, we use the term **Template**. In the API, the same concept is called a **Blueprint** (internally `checklist`).
:::

### Key concepts

#### Process independence from template changes
Template edits only affect future launches. Running processes keep their original instructions - they won't change mid-flight. This protects active work while letting you improve templates continuously.

:::tip[Adding tasks to running processes]
You can add extra one-off [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to a process *after* it's launched. You aren't limited to the steps in the original template.
:::

#### Launch methods

*   **Manual launching** - From the Templates interface
*   **Automatic triggers** - API calls, webhooks, or scheduled automation
*   **Cascade launching** - When tasks in other processes complete (via automated actions)
*   **Web form integration** - Through kick-off form submissions
*   **Email triggers** - Send messages to designated addresses
*   **Magic links** - External people can start processes without logging in

#### How launch methods work together

All six methods converge to create an active process from a template.

# Template Source

  Magic: Magic Link {

**Diagram description:** Six launch methods all create the same result - an independently running process with its own timeline and assignments.

**What to notice:**
- All six methods produce the same outcome - an active process instance
- You can customize settings before each launch regardless of the method
- The template stays unchanged while each process runs on its own

#### Customization during launch
When launching, you can:
*   Set a process name (up to 550 characters)
*   Change task assignments (members, groups, or guests)
*   Adjust deadlines per task
*   Pre-fill kick-off form fields with relevant data
*   Assign the process to folders and add tags

You can also [set up auto-naming](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/edit-processes/how-can-i-auto-name-a-process-in-tallyfy/) to generate process names from kick-off form field values automatically.
