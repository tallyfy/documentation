## Understanding process launching

Launching a process creates an active workflow instance from a template. This operation generates a copy of the template configured for a specific business scenario.

Templates serve as reusable blueprints that can initiate multiple processes. Each process represents a unique application of the template pattern:

* **Template**: The master pattern (e.g., "Client Onboarding")
* **Process**: A specific instance (e.g., "Coca Cola" client onboarding)

When you modify a template, the changes only affect processes launched after those modifications. Existing processes retain their original configuration.
