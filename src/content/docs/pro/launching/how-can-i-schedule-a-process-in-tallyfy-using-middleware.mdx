## How to schedule recurring process launches using middleware

Tallyfy doesn't have a built-in scheduler to automatically start processes on a repeating basis (e.g., every Monday, or the first of the month). However, you can easily set this up using a [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) tool like Zapier, Make, or Power Automate.

This guide shows the general steps using Zapier as an example.

### What you need

* A Tallyfy account with the process [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) you want to schedule ready to go.
* An account with a middleware service (like Zapier, Make, or Power Automate).
* You need to have already connected your Tallyfy account to your chosen middleware service.

### How to set it up using Zapier (Example)

#### 1. Choose the Schedule Trigger

In Zapier, create a new Zap. For the trigger (the first step), search for and select the built-in **Schedule by Zapier** app.

#### 2. Set Your Schedule

Configure when you want the process to launch automatically:
* Choose how often (e.g., Every Day, Every Week, Every Month).
* Select the specific day (e.g., Monday) or date (e.g., 1st of the month).
* Choose the time of day.

#### 3. Add the Tallyfy Action

For the action step (what happens when the schedule triggers), choose the **Tallyfy** app. Select the action **Launch Process**.

#### 4. Configure the Process Launch Details

Tell Zapier which Tallyfy process to launch and how:
* Select the specific Tallyfy **Template** you want to use.
* Define how the new process run should be **Named**. It's good practice to include the date in the name so each run is unique (e.g., "Weekly Report - {{zap_meta_human_now}}"). Zapier often provides special codes like `{{zap_meta_human_now}}` to insert the current date/time.
* Fill in any other required information needed to launch that specific template.

#### 5. Test and Turn On

Test the Zap to make sure it launches the process correctly in Tallyfy. Give your Zap a name and turn it on.

Now, Zapier will automatically launch your Tallyfy process based on the schedule you set up, without you needing to do it manually each time.
