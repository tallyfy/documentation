## Schedule process launches with middleware

You can auto-launch Tallyfy processes on a recurring schedule using [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) tools like Zapier, Make, or Power Automate. Connect a schedule trigger to Tallyfy's **Launch Process** action, and your processes run hands-free.

This guide uses Zapier as an example - the steps are similar in other [middleware platforms](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/).

### What you'll need

- A Tallyfy account with the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) you want to schedule
- An account with a middleware service (Zapier, Make, or Power Automate)
- Your Tallyfy account connected to that middleware service

### Setting it up in Zapier

#### 1. Pick the schedule trigger

Create a new Zap. For the trigger, search for and select **Schedule by Zapier**.

#### 2. Set your schedule

Configure when the process should launch:
- Frequency - Every Day, Every Week, or Every Month
- Specific day (e.g., Monday) or date (e.g., 1st of the month)
- Time of day

#### 3. Add the Tallyfy action

For the action step, pick the **Tallyfy** app and choose **Launch Process**.

#### 4. Configure launch details

Set which process to launch and how:
- Select the Tallyfy **Template** to use
- **Name** the process instance - include the date so each run is unique (e.g., "Weekly Report - `{{zap_meta_human_now}}`"). Zapier's `{{zap_meta_human_now}}` variable inserts the current date/time.
- Fill in any kick-off form fields the template requires

#### 5. Test and turn on

Test your Zap to confirm it launches the process correctly in Tallyfy. Name your Zap and turn it on.
