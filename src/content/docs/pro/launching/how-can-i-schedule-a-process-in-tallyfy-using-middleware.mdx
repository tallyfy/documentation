## Setting up recurring scheduled processes

While Tallyfy doesn't currently have native scheduling capabilities, you can automate recurring process launches using middleware platforms. This guide demonstrates implementation with Zapier, though similar steps apply to Microsoft Power Automate and other middleware solutions.

## Prerequisites

* Tallyfy account with templates ready for launch
* Zapier account (or alternative middleware platform)
* Zapier connection to Tallyfy configured

## Configuration steps using Zapier

### 1. Create a scheduled trigger

Select the "Schedule" trigger in Zapier to define when your process should launch.

### 2. Configure the schedule

Set your desired frequency parameters:
* Daily, weekly, or monthly recurrence
* Specific time of day
* Day of month (for monthly schedules)

### 3. Add the Tallyfy action

Select "Tallyfy" as the app and "Launch Process" as the action.

### 4. Configure the process details

Specify the template and process name parameters:
* Select the template to use
* Define a naming convention for the launched processes
* Configure any additional required fields

### 5. Test and activate

Test the integration to verify functionality, then name and activate your Zap.

Once activated, the Zap will automatically launch your process according to the configured schedule without requiring manual intervention.
