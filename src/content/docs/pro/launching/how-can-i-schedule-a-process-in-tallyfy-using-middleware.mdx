## How to schedule recurring process launches using middleware

While Tallyfy doesn't currently have native scheduling capabilities, you can automate recurring [process launches](/products/pro/launching/) using [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) platforms. This guide demonstrates implementation with Zapier, though similar steps apply to Microsoft Power Automate and other middleware solutions.

## Requirements

* Tallyfy account with [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) ready for [launch](/products/pro/launching/)
* Zapier account (or alternative middleware platform)
* Zapier connection to Tallyfy configured

## Configuration steps using Zapier

### 1. Create a scheduled trigger

Select the "Schedule" trigger in Zapier to define when your [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) should launch.

### 2. Configure the schedule

Set your desired frequency parameters:
* Daily, weekly, or monthly recurrence
* Specific time of day
* Day of month (for monthly schedules)

### 3. Add the Tallyfy action

Select "Tallyfy" as the app and "Launch Process" as the action.

### 4. Configure the process details

Specify the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) and process name parameters:
* Select the template to use
* Define a naming convention for the launched [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)
* Configure any additional required [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/)

### 5. Test and activate

Test the integration to verify functionality, then name and activate your Zap.

Once activated, the Zap will automatically [launch](/products/pro/launching/) your [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) according to the configured schedule without requiring manual intervention.
