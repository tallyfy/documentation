## How to schedule recurring process launches using middleware

Tallyfy doesn't have a built-in scheduler to start processes automatically on a schedule (e.g., every Monday). However, you can easily do this using a [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) tool like Zapier, Make, or Power Automate.

This guide shows the basic steps using Zapier as an example.

### What you need

*   A Tallyfy account with the process [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) you want to schedule.
*   An account with a middleware service (like Zapier, Make, Power Automate).
*   Your Tallyfy account connected to your chosen middleware service.

### How to set it up using Zapier (example)

#### 1. Choose the schedule trigger

In Zapier, start a new Zap. For the trigger, search for and select the 'Schedule by Zapier' app.

#### 2. Set your schedule

Set when the process should launch automatically:
* Choose the frequency (e.g., Every Day, Every Week, Every Month).
* Choose the specific day (e.g., Monday) or date (e.g., 1st of the month).
* Set the time of day.

#### 3. Add the Tallyfy action

For the action step, choose the **Tallyfy** app. Choose the 'Launch Process' action.

#### 4. Configure the process launch details

Configure which Tallyfy process to launch and how:
* Select the specific Tallyfy **Template** to use.
* Set how the new process instance should be **Named**. It's best to include the date so each instance is unique (e.g., "Weekly Report - `{{zap_meta_human_now}}`"). Zapier provides variables like `{{zap_meta_human_now}}` to insert the current date/time.
* Fill in other required details needed to launch that specific template.

#### 5. Test and turn on

Test your Zap to ensure it launches the process correctly in Tallyfy. Name your Zap and turn it on.

Now, Zapier will automatically launch the Tallyfy process on the schedule you set, without manual effort each time.
