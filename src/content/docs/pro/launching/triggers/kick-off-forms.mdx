### What you need

- Permission to edit Tallyfy [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).
- A process template where you want to add a starting form.
- To know what information you need to collect before the process starts.

### Understanding kick-off forms

Kick-off forms are forms attached to the very beginning of a Tallyfy [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). They ensure you collect all the necessary starting information *before* the main workflow [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) begin.

You can use these forms internally for your team, or make them **public** so people outside your organization (like customers or partners) can fill them out to start a process.

Unlike basic online forms, Tallyfy kick-off forms are directly linked to the rest of the workflow. When someone submits the form, the process starts immediately, and everyone can track its progress.

### Creating a kick-off form

<Steps>
1. Go to the **Templates** library.
2. Open the template you want to add the form to in **Edit** mode.
3. In the left sidebar of the editor, click **Triggers**.
4. Select **Kick-off Form**.
5. Click **+ Add Field** to add your questions ([form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/)).
6. Set up each field (name, type, required?, help text, options).
7. Save your changes to the template.
</Steps>

### Field types available

You can use various field types:

*   Short Text (for names, IDs)
*   Long Text (for descriptions)
*   Dropdown List (pick one from a list)
*   Checklist (pick multiple from a list)
*   Radio Buttons (pick only one option)
*   Date
*   File Upload

Mark fields as **Required** if the process cannot start without that information. Note: Having required fields limits how the process can be started automatically (e.g., cannot be started by email or some API calls without providing the required data).

### How people fill out the kick-off form

When someone [launches](/products/pro/launching/) a process that has a kick-off form:

<Steps>
1. They click **Launch Process** on the template.
2. The kick-off form appears immediately.
3. They fill out the fields (required fields are marked with *).
4. They click **Submit**.
5. The process then starts, using the information entered.
</Steps>

### Seeing the kick-off form answers later

Anyone working on the process can see the information submitted in the kick-off form:
<Steps>
1. Open any [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) within the running process.
2. Click the **Info** tab in the task details.
3. Expand the **Kick-off Fields** section.
</Steps>

This helps provide context for later tasks.

:::note[Filling forms automatically]
You can pre-fill kick-off forms automatically using data from other systems, often via [web form links](/products/pro/launching/how-to-launch-a-tallyfy-process-from-a-webform/) or middleware.
:::

### Public kick-off forms (for external users)

You can share a kick-off form publicly so anyone (even non-Tallyfy users) can fill it out to start a process.

#### Why use public forms?
*   **Starts workflow automatically**: No delay between form submission and process start.
*   **Submitter tracking link**: The person who submits gets a unique, permanent link to track the progress (if they verify their email).
*   **Email verification**: Helps prevent fake submissions and allows Tallyfy to send updates to the submitter.
*   **Save and return**: Submitters can save partly filled forms and come back later using their link.
*   **No extra tools needed**: Directly integrates form submission with your Tallyfy process.

#### Important note on deactivated members and public forms
If the Tallyfy member associated with setting up the public form gets deactivated, it can affect the public link. Always check and potentially reassign public forms before deactivating members to avoid issues. (See [Removing Members](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-can-i-remove-a-member-from-my-tallyfy-organization/) for details).

### Making a kick-off form public

<Steps>
1. Open the template in **Edit** mode.
2. Go to **Triggers** > **Kick-off Form**.
3. In the panel on the right, find **Public Sharing** and switch it **ON**.

4. Click **Get Public Link**.
    ![Get Public Link button](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-get-public-link-kickoff-form.png)
5. A box will appear with the shareable link. Copy this link.
    ![Public link pop-up box](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-public-link-kickoff-modal.png)
6. Share this link with people outside your organization.
</Steps>

### How public form submission works

When someone clicks the public link:
<Steps>
1. They are asked to enter their email address (for verification).
2. They receive an email with a private access link.
3. Clicking that link takes them to the form.
4. They fill out and submit the form.
5. The process launches in Tallyfy.
6. They can use their private access link later to check the process status.
</Steps>

This is great for forms that might take time to fill out.

### Tips for creating good kick-off forms

- Only ask for essential information needed to *start* the process.
- Use clear names for your fields.
- Arrange fields logically.
- Only make fields required if absolutely necessary.
- Use the "Guidance text" option for fields that need extra explanation.
- Test the form yourself before sharing it widely.
