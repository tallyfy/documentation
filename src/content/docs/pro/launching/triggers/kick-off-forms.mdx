## Understanding kick-off forms

Kick-off forms collect essential information required to initiate a process. They ensure all necessary data is gathered before workflow execution begins. These forms can be used internally or made public for external submissions.

Tallyfy integrates form submission directly with process execution, converting "submit and pray" into "submit and track." This integration enables full visibility into post-submission activities.

## Creating kick-off forms

To set up a kick-off form:

1. Open the template editor
2. Locate the **Triggers** section
3. Select **Kick-off Form**

## Available field types

Kick-off forms support multiple field types:
* Short Text Field
* Long Text Area
* Dropdown List
* Checklist
* Radio Buttons
* Date
* File Upload

Fields can be marked as **Required** or optional.

:::note[Required field implications]
When a field is marked **Required**, it limits automation options. Processes with required fields cannot be launched via certain triggers (like email) without providing values for those fields.

## Launching with kick-off forms

When launching a process with a kick-off form:

1. The form appears immediately after initiating the launch
2. All required fields must be completed
3. The process begins after form submission

## Accessing kick-off data in tasks

Kick-off form data is accessible throughout the process:
1. Open any task in the process
2. Access the **Kick-off Fields** drawer to view submitted information

This provides valuable context for task execution at each step.

:::note[Automatic form population]
Kick-off forms can be automatically populated from external systems, web forms, and CRMs. See [Web Form Integration](/products/pro/launching/how-to-launch-a-tallyfy-process-from-a-webform/) for implementation details.

## Public kick-off forms

Tallyfy's public kick-off forms provide advantages over standalone form solutions:

### Key benefits

* Integrated workflow initiation - forms launch processes immediately upon submission
* Persistent access - submitters receive a permanent "link for life" for tracking
* Email verification - validates submitter identity to ensure authentic submissions
* Easy return capability - allows partial completion and later return
* No middleware requirements - direct process integration without additional tools

### Email verification advantages

* Eliminates fake submissions
* Ensures submitters can receive notifications
* Enables reliable communication throughout the process
* Prevents form abandonment through follow-up capabilities

## Making a form public

To enable public access to a kick-off form:

1. In the template editor, navigate to **Triggers**
2. Locate the **Public Sharing** option and toggle it to **ON**
3. Click **Get Public Link** next to the kick-off form

4. The system displays a modal with the shareable link

## Public form submission flow

When external users access the public link:

1. They enter their email address
2. They receive an access link via email
3. The link directs them to a guest page for form completion
4. The same link provides ongoing access to form progress
5. Users can complete forms in multiple sessions if needed
6. Upon submission, they can track subsequent process steps

This approach is particularly valuable for complex forms requiring information gathering over time.
