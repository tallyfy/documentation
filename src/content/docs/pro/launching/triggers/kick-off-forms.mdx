## Prerequisites

Before setting up kick-off forms, ensure you have:
- A Tallyfy account with template editing permissions
- A process template where you want to add a kick-off form
- Clear understanding of what data you need to collect at process initiation

## Understanding kick-off forms

Kick-off forms collect essential information required to initiate a process. They ensure all necessary data is gathered before workflow execution begins, providing critical context for subsequent tasks. These forms can be used internally by team members or made public for external submissions.

Tallyfy integrates form submission directly with process execution, enabling full visibility into post-submission activities and status tracking throughout the workflow. Our [form intake software](https://tallyfy.com/solutions/form-intake-software/) transforms traditional data collection into the first step of a structured, trackable process.

## Creating kick-off forms

To set up a kick-off form:

1. Navigate to the **Templates** section
2. Select and edit the desired template
3. Locate the **Triggers** section in the left sidebar
4. Select **Kick-off Form**
5. Click **+ Add Field** to add form fields
6. Configure each field with appropriate settings
7. Save your changes

## Available field types and usage

Kick-off forms support multiple field types to capture different types of information:

| Field Type | Best Used For | Example |
|------------|---------------|---------|
| Short Text Field | Names, IDs, simple answers | Customer name, Order number |
| Long Text Area | Descriptions, notes, detailed information | Project description, Special instructions |
| Dropdown List | Selection from predefined options | Department, Product category |
| Checklist | Multiple selectable options | Services requested, Features needed |
| Radio Buttons | Mutually exclusive options | Priority level, Approval status |
| Date | Time-specific information | Start date, Deadline |
| File Upload | Documents, images, attachments | Contract, Identity proof |

Fields can be marked as **Required** or optional. When marked required, users must complete these fields before the process can be launched.

:::note[Required field implications]
When a field is marked **Required**, it limits automation options. Processes with required fields cannot be launched via certain triggers (like email) without providing values for those fields.
:::

## Form field configuration options

When adding fields to your kick-off form, you can configure several properties:

1. **Field name** - Clear, descriptive name (e.g., "Customer Email")
2. **Field type** - Select from available field types
3. **Required** - Toggle whether the field must be completed
4. **Default value** - Preset value to appear in the field
5. **Help text** - Additional instructions visible to users
6. **Options** - For dropdowns, checklists, and radio buttons

## Launching with kick-off forms

When launching a process with a kick-off form:

1. Click **Launch Process** on the template
2. The form appears immediately after initiating the launch
3. Complete all required fields (marked with *)
4. Optional fields can be left blank if not needed
5. Click **Submit** to begin the process

## Accessing kick-off data in tasks

Kick-off form data is accessible throughout the process lifecycle:
1. Open any task in the process
2. Click the **Info** tab
3. Access the **Kick-off Fields** drawer to view submitted information
4. All form data remains available to all process participants

This provides valuable context for task execution at each step.

:::note[Automatic form population]
Kick-off forms can be automatically populated from external systems, web forms, and CRMs. See [Web Form Integration](/products/pro/launching/how-to-launch-a-tallyfy-process-from-a-webform/) for implementation details.

## Public kick-off forms

Tallyfy's public kick-off forms provide advantages over standalone form solutions:

### Key benefits

* **Integrated workflow initiation** - Forms launch processes immediately upon submission
* **Persistent access** - Submitters receive a permanent "link for life" for tracking
* **Email verification** - Validates submitter identity to ensure authentic submissions
* **Easy return capability** - Allows partial completion and later return
* **No middleware requirements** - Direct process integration without additional tools

### Email verification advantages

* Eliminates fake submissions by requiring email confirmation
* Ensures submitters can receive notifications about process progress
* Enables reliable communication throughout the process lifecycle
* Prevents form abandonment through follow-up capabilities

### Member deactivation and public forms

When a member associated with a public kick-off form is deactivated or disabled, the following occurs:

* If the selected inviter is not the template creator and they get disabled, Tallyfy automatically updates it with the template creator name and keeps the public sharing ON
* If the selected inviter is the template creator and their account gets disabled, Tallyfy turns OFF the public sharing and makes the copied URL invalid until public sharing is turned ON again with a newly selected member

To prevent disruption to your public forms when deactivating members:
1. Before deactivating a member, check if they are associated with any public kick-off forms
2. If so, reassign the form to another active member by editing the template settings
3. This ensures continuous availability of your public forms

## Making a form public

To enable public access to a kick-off form:

1. In the template editor, navigate to **Triggers**
2. Locate the **Public Sharing** option in the right panel
3. Toggle it to **ON**
4. Click **Get Public Link** next to the kick-off form

![Enable public sharing](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-make-kickoff-public.png)

![Access public link option](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-get-public-link-kickoff-form.png)

5. The system displays a modal with the shareable link
6. Copy this link to share with external users

## Public form submission flow

When external users access the public link:

1. They enter their email address for verification
2. They receive an access link via email
3. The link directs them to a guest page for form completion
4. The same link provides ongoing access to form progress
5. Users can complete forms in multiple sessions if needed
6. Upon submission, they can track subsequent process steps

This approach is particularly valuable for complex forms requiring information gathering over time.

## Best practices for kick-off forms

- Keep forms as concise as possible while collecting essential information
- Use clear, descriptive field labels that indicate exactly what information is needed
- Organize fields in a logical sequence following a natural information flow
- Make only truly essential fields required to minimize barriers to completion
- Include help text for fields that might need additional explanation
- Test your form with actual users before making it publicly available
