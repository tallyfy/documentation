## Launching via a kick off form

Kick-off forms are the forms you fill out to get things moving! Some processes require specific information to start, and that's where kick-off forms come in.

They ensure that the necessary details are filled out before the process begins. You can even create **public** kick off forms to automatically launch a process when they're submitted.

That's a lot better than other apps where you _just_ create independent forms - because there is always a process _after_ a form is submitted. Tallyfy handles that process, so instead of "submit and pray" on other form apps - you get "submit and track". You can track or terminate any process from a kick off form submission.

This method of launching is also sometimes called launching manually.

### Creating and editing kick-off forms

1. In the template editor under "Triggers" - select "Kick-off Form"

2. Choose from different form field options like Short Text Field, Long Text Area, Dropdown List, Checklist, Radio Buttons, Date, and even mark a field as **Required** or not. You can add as many fields as you need!

Marking a kick off form field as **Required** will limit your options when it comes to automating the launch of a process, and that is because the process cannot be launched unless the fields marked **Required** are provided or filled out.

3. Launch your process and you will see your kick off form

5. After launch - you can update your kick-off form fields if you like. Simply "Re-Open" the very first step labelled "Kick Off Fields", make changes, and save them.

6. The information from every kick-off form field is visible within every task in the process under a neat little drawer called "Kick-off Fields". This makes it very useful as a reference for someone doing a task to learn the context of it.

## About publicly accessible kick off forms

Tallyfy offers native, public kick-off forms which are fully integrated into your workflow. Tallyfy's sticky, authenticated and easy-return forms offer the following benefits that don't exist in apps that let you just design standalone forms:

- You don't have to purchase and use a separate forms app just to make public forms.
- As soon as the form is submitted - it kicks off your process.
- The submitter can track and see their form submission and all future tasks at their own guest link, which stays the same forever. We call this a "link for life".
- You don't need a "middleware" app to take form submission data and pipe it to other systems - since it's already baked into the process on Tallyfy.

To summarize the unique differentiators that only Tallyfy offers vs. vendors that only let you make standalone forms:

- **No anonymous submissions** - many problems with forms today are due to fake submissions from incorrect or fake email addresses. By validating an email address up-front - we ensure genuine and authentic submissions where the email of the submitter actually exists and can actually receive replies or emails.
- **Easy returns and follow-ups by default** - we automate follow-ups on partially filled forms - ensuring that you get more completed form submissions. Form abandonment is a huge issue, and the validated cause of a large percentage of lost revenue, disgruntled customers, and more. Sticky forms solve this.
- **Link for life** - after someone submits a form, the same link they used to fill the form (their guest link) can be used to assign them other tasks. In other words, the form submitter never has to know or bookmark another link again - it's just one link for life!

### Making a kick off form public

To make a kick off form public - click on "Public Sharing" when you're in the Triggers section of the template editor and flip it "ON". You will get a unique URL for public form submissions when public sharing is successfully turned on.

- A piece of text will appear on the left pane - against the kick-off form - labeled "Get Public Link" - please click that:

- You will then see this modal, which gives you the link you need to share with anyone who needs to fill out the form.

- Anyone with the link can go to the form. People must enter their email to proceed, and then a link will be emailed to the email address they entered. This ensures that the email actually exists, isn't fake, and can accept the incoming emails without problems. After all - do you really want a form submission from someone unknown whose email address is impossible to reach?

As soon as the submitter clicks their unique link - they will go to a guest page (a link that stays the same forever for that guest email address) which lets them complete their form.

The great part is that they don't have to fill the form "in one sitting" - they can come back to it tomorrow, or the week after - especially if they don't have all the requested information.

This is really helpful for long forms, or simply in cases where the submitter doesn't have all the information needed to complete the form at this time.
