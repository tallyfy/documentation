## What are kick-off forms?

Kick-off forms sit at the beginning of a Tallyfy template and collect information before the main workflow starts. They work for both internal team members and external people - customers, partners, or vendors can submit a public kick-off form to launch a process automatically.

Unlike standalone forms, kick-off form data flows directly into the process steps that follow.

### Creating a kick-off form

<Steps>
1. Go to the **Templates** library.
2. Open a template in **Edit** mode.
3. In the left sidebar, click **Triggers**.
4. Select **Kick-off Form**.
5. Click **+ Add Field** to add questions ([form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/)).
6. Configure each field - name, type, required toggle, help text, options, and [default content](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-set-default-content-for-form-fields/) if needed.
7. Save your template.
</Steps>

### Available field types

| Field type | Use for |
|-----------|---------|
| Short Text | Names, IDs, brief responses |
| Long Text | Descriptions, detailed explanations |
| Dropdown | Pick one from a predefined list |
| Multi-select | Pick multiple from a list |
| Radio Buttons | Pick exactly one option |
| Date | Scheduling, deadlines |
| Email | Email addresses |
| File Upload | Documents, images, attachments |
| Table | Structured tabular data |
| Assignee selector | Pick people to assign within the process |

Mark fields as **Required** only if the process can't start without that data. Required fields prevent automatic launching via email triggers or some API calls that don't supply the field values.

### Completing kick-off forms

<Steps>
1. Click **Launch Process** on the template.
2. The kick-off form appears.
3. Fill out the fields (required fields show a *).
4. Click **Submit**.
5. The process starts with the submitted data.
</Steps>

### Viewing kick-off form answers

Anyone on the process can see submitted kick-off data:
<Steps>
1. Open any [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in the running process.
2. Click the **Info** tab.
3. Expand the **Kick-off Fields** section.
</Steps>

:::note[Filling forms automatically]
You can pre-fill kick-off forms using data from other systems via [web form links](/products/pro/launching/how-to-launch-a-tallyfy-process-from-a-webform/) or middleware.
:::

### Public kick-off forms

Share a kick-off form publicly so anyone - even without a Tallyfy account - can submit it to start a process.

**Why use public forms:**
- **Instant workflow launch** - no delay between submission and process start
- **Submitter tracking** - the person who submits gets a unique link to track progress (after email verification)
- **Spam prevention** - email verification filters out fake submissions
- **Branding** - public forms display your organization's logo

#### Deactivated members and public forms
Tallyfy uses the `kickoff_sharing_user_id` to authenticate public form submissions. When that member gets deactivated, Tallyfy automatically reassigns the public form to the template owner. If the template owner is also inactive, the public link won't work. Check public form assignments before deactivating members. (See [Removing Members](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-can-i-remove-a-member-from-my-tallyfy-organization/).)

:::caution[Magic links and kick-off forms]
Magic links skip the kick-off form interface entirely - they launch the process directly. If your kick-off form has required fields, magic links can't supply that data. For external users or pre-filled required fields, use:
- Public kick-off form links
- Web form redirects with query parameters
- API calls with `prerun` field data
- Middleware integrations
:::

### Making a kick-off form public

<Steps>
1. Open the template in **Edit** mode.
2. Go to **Triggers** > **Kick-off Form**.
3. Find **Public Sharing** on the right panel and switch it **ON**.
    ![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-make-kickoff-public.png)
4. Click **Get Public Link**.
    ![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-get-public-link-kickoff-form.png)
5. Copy the shareable link from the dialog.

6. Share this link with people outside your organization.
</Steps>

### How public form submission works

<Steps>
1. The visitor enters their email address.
2. Tallyfy sends them a private access link via email.
3. They click the link to open the form.
4. They fill out and submit.
5. The process launches inside Tallyfy.
6. They can reuse their private link to check process status later.
</Steps>

### Public forms vs. internal steps

| | Public kick-off forms | Internal process steps |
|---|---|---|
| **Audience** | External users without Tallyfy accounts | Team members and assigned guests |
| **Purpose** | Collect initial data to start a workflow | Execute tasks after the process starts |
| **Access** | Public link via email, website, etc. | Tallyfy dashboard with login |
| **Experience** | Simple form with your branding | Full task management with comments, attachments, tracking |
| **Visibility** | Submitters track overall progress only | Full internal task details |

:::tip[Example: purchase requisitions]
A vendor submits a purchase order through your public form. This creates an internal approval workflow where your finance team reviews and processes the order - invisible to the vendor except for status updates.
:::

### Best practices

#### Collect only what's needed upfront
- Ask for data the launcher definitely has right now
- Save detailed branching questions for later workflow steps
- Keep the form short. Don't front-load complexity.

:::tip[Equipment insurance example]
Instead of "List all equipment details, specifications, and carrier requirements" on the kick-off form, ask "Equipment or facilities?" and "Client ID?" Then use [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) to reveal detailed collection steps based on those answers.
:::

#### Form design tips
- Use clear field names - skip jargon
- Arrange fields in logical order
- Mark fields required only when truly necessary
- Add help text for anything that needs explanation
- Test the form before sharing it widely

#### Common mistakes
- **Front-loading questionnaires** - asking for info that isn't available yet
- **Branching in kick-off forms** - conditional logic belongs in workflow steps, not the initial form
- **Over-requiring fields** - making fields mandatory when launchers might not have that data
- **Ignoring user context** - different users have different information at launch time
