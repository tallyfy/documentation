### What prerequisites are needed for kick-off form setup?

- Permission to edit Tallyfy® templates for configuration access.
- A process template where you want to add a starting form for workflow initiation.
- Clear understanding of what information you need to collect before the process starts.

These requirements ensure proper form setup and effective data collection for workflow automation.

## How do kick-off forms enable process launching and data collection?

Kick-off forms attach to the beginning of Tallyfy® templates, ensuring comprehensive information collection before main workflow tasks commence.

These forms accommodate both internal team usage and public access, enabling external stakeholders including customers or partners to initiate processes through form submission. Unlike standalone online forms, Tallyfy® kick-off forms integrate directly with subsequent workflow steps for seamless automation.

Upon form submission, processes launch immediately with complete progress tracking capabilities across all participants and stakeholders, creating a smooth transition from data collection to workflow execution.

### How can I create an effective kick-off form?

<Steps>
1. Go to the **Templates** library.
2. Open the template you want to add the form to in **Edit** mode.
3. In the left sidebar of the editor, click **Triggers**.
4. Select **Kick-off Form**.
5. Click **+ Add Field** to add your questions ([form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/)).
6. Set up each field (name, type, required?, help text, options, and [default content](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-set-default-content-for-form-fields/) if needed).
7. Save your changes to the template.
</Steps>

### What field types are available for comprehensive data collection?

You can use various field types to capture different types of information:

*   Short Text (for names, IDs, brief responses)
*   Long Text (for descriptions, detailed explanations)
*   Dropdown List (pick one from a predefined list)
*   Checklist (pick multiple from a list for comprehensive selection)
*   Radio Buttons (pick only one option from exclusive choices)
*   Date (for scheduling and timeline information)
*   File Upload (for documents, images, and attachments)

Mark fields as Required if the process cannot start without that information. Note: Having required fields limits how the process can be started automatically (e.g., cannot be started by email or some API calls without providing the required data).

### How do users complete kick-off forms during process launch?

When someone launches a process that has a kick-off form:

<Steps>
1. They click **Launch Process** on the template.
2. The kick-off form appears immediately.
3. They fill out the fields (required fields are marked with *).
4. They click **Submit**.
5. The process then starts, using the information entered.
</Steps>

### How can I access kick-off form answers during process execution?

Anyone working on the process can see the information submitted in the kick-off form:
<Steps>
1. Open any [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) within the running process.
2. Click the **Info** tab in the task details.
3. Expand the **Kick-off Fields** section.
</Steps>

This helps provide context for later tasks.

:::note[Filling forms automatically]
You can pre-fill kick-off forms automatically using data from other systems, often via [web form links](/products/pro/launching/how-to-launch-a-tallyfy-process-from-a-webform/) or middleware.
:::

### How do public kick-off forms enable external collaboration?

You can share a kick-off form publicly so anyone (even non-Tallyfy users) can fill it out to start a process.

#### Why should I use public forms for external engagement?
*   **Starts workflow automatically**: No delay between form submission and process start for immediate action.
*   **Submitter tracking link**: The person who submits gets a unique, permanent link to track the progress (if they verify their email).
*   **Email verification**: Helps prevent fake submissions and allows Tallyfy to send updates to the submitter.
*   **Save and return**: Submitters can save partly filled forms and come back later using their link for convenience.
*   **No extra tools needed**: Directly integrates form submission with your Tallyfy process for seamless automation.

Public forms bridge the gap between external stakeholders and internal workflows.

#### Important note on deactivated members and public forms
If the Tallyfy member associated with setting up the public form gets deactivated, it can affect the public link. Always check and potentially reassign public forms before deactivating members to avoid issues. (See [Removing Members](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-can-i-remove-a-member-from-my-tallyfy-organization/) for details).

### How can I make a kick-off form available to external users?

<Steps>
1. Open the template in **Edit** mode.
2. Go to **Triggers** > **Kick-off Form**.
3. In the panel on the right, find **Public Sharing** and switch it **ON**.
    ![Turning on public sharing for kick-off form](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-make-kickoff-public.png)
4. Click **Get Public Link**.
    ![Get Public Link button](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-get-public-link-kickoff-form.png)
5. A box will appear with the shareable link. Copy this link.
    ![Public link pop-up box](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-public-link-kickoff-modal.png)
6. Share this link with people outside your organization.
</Steps>

### How does the public form submission process work?

When someone clicks the public link:
<Steps>
1. They are asked to enter their email address (for verification).
2. They receive an email with a private access link.
3. Clicking that link takes them to the form.
4. They fill out and submit the form.
5. The process launches in Tallyfy.
6. They can use their private access link later to check the process status.
</Steps>

This is great for forms that might take time to fill out.

### What are best practices for creating effective kick-off forms?

#### **Progressive Information Gathering Strategy**
The most effective kick-off forms follow a "minimal upfront, progressive collection" approach:

- **Only include guaranteed available information**: Ask only for data you know the person launching will definitely have at the start
- **Avoid complex conditional questions**: Save detailed branching questions for later workflow steps where context has been established
- **Keep initial forms lightweight**: Don't overwhelm users with extensive forms that might discourage process initiation
- **Plan for just-in-time data collection**: Design subsequent workflow steps to gather additional information precisely when it's needed

:::tip[Equipment Insurance Example]
Instead of asking "List all equipment details, specifications, and carrier requirements" in the kickoff form, start with just "Is this endorsement for equipment or facilities?" and "What's the client ID?" Then use conditional automations to reveal appropriate detailed collection steps based on those initial answers.
:::

#### **Form Design Best Practices**
- **Use clear field names** that users can easily understand without technical jargon
- **Arrange fields logically** to create a smooth, intuitive user experience
- **Mark fields as required sparingly**: Only make fields required if the process absolutely cannot proceed without that information
- **Provide helpful guidance text** for fields that need extra explanation or context
- **Test thoroughly** before sharing widely to ensure proper functionality across different user scenarios

#### **Advanced Progressive Collection Techniques**
- **Conditional step revelation**: Use [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) to show additional data collection steps based on kickoff form responses
- **Role-based information requests**: Collect different information based on who is launching the process (department, expertise level, etc.)
- **Just-in-time validation**: Verify and expand initial information at appropriate workflow milestones rather than upfront
- **Exception path planning**: Design clear procedures for handling unusual situations that don't fit standard information collection patterns

#### **Common Mistakes to Avoid**
- **Front-loading complex questionnaires**: Asking for detailed information that may not be available until later in the process
- **Branching in kickoff forms**: Complex conditional logic belongs in workflow steps, not initial forms
- **Requiring uncertain information**: Making fields mandatory when the person launching may not have that data readily available
- **One-size-fits-all approaches**: Not considering that different types of users may have different information available at launch time

These practices ensure high completion rates, quality data collection, and smooth workflow initiation while supporting sophisticated information gathering throughout the process lifecycle.
