snippet: The REST API enables automated workflow initiation through external system
  integration by using authentication credentials template IDs and JSON requests to
  trigger processes with custom data fields and task assignments.
title: Launch via API
---

## Prerequisites

Before implementing API-triggered processes, ensure you have:
- A Tallyfy account with API access enabled
- API authentication credentials (API key or OAuth token)
- Knowledge of the template IDs you wish to launch
- Basic understanding of REST API concepts and JSON

## API-triggered process launches

Tallyfy's REST API enables programmatic process initiation for seamless integration with external systems and applications. This method is particularly useful for automated workflows, system integrations, and creating custom launch interfaces.

## Implementation steps

1. **Obtain authentication credentials**
   - Generate an API key in your Tallyfy account settings
   - Store this key securely for API requests

2. **Identify the process template**
   - Locate the Template ID from the URL when viewing the template
   - Note any kickoff form fields that need to be populated

3. **Construct the API request**
   - Use the `/api/v1/processes` endpoint with a POST request
   - Include authentication in the request headers
   - Format the request body with template ID and process details

4. **Handle the API response**
   - Capture the Process ID from the successful response
   - Implement error handling for failed requests

For detailed implementation instructions, including request payload formats and authentication requirements, refer to the comprehensive [API Process Launch Guide](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/how-to-start-a-process-using-tallyfy-api/).

## Key features

API-triggered launches offer several advantages:

### Automation capabilities
- Trigger processes based on events in other systems
- Schedule recurring process launches
- Create bulk process initiations

### Data integration
- Populate kickoff form fields with external data
- Pass complex data structures into processes
- Link processes to records in other systems

### Process customization
- Implement custom process naming conventions
- Control task assignments programmatically
- Set custom deadlines based on business rules

## Sample API request

```json
POST /api/v1/processes HTTP/1.1
Host: api.tallyfy.com
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "template_id": "your-template-id",
  "name": "API Triggered Process - Customer Onboarding",
  "kickoff_fields": {
    "customer_name": "Acme Corporation",
    "contract_value": 15000,
    "start_date": "2023-05-01T00:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

## Common use cases

API-triggered processes are ideal for:
- Connecting CRM systems to initiate customer onboarding
- Triggering approval workflows from document management systems
- Launching inspection processes from IoT devices
- Creating processes from form submissions
- Initiating workflows based on database events
