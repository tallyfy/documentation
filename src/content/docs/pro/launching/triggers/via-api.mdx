## API-triggered process launches

Tallyfy's REST API enables programmatic process initiation for integration with external systems and applications. This method is particularly useful for automated workflows and system integrations.

## Implementation resources

## Key features

API-triggered launches offer several advantages:
* Automated process initiation
* Kickoff form field population
* Custom process naming
* Assignment control
* Integration with external systems

## Prerequisites

* Access to Tallyfy API
* Authentication token
* Process template ID
* Permission to launch processes
