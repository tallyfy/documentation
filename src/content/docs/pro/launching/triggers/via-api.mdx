## How can I launch processes via the Tallyfy® API for automation?

### What prerequisites are needed for API-based process launching?

Before starting, make sure you have:
- A Tallyfy® account with API access enabled for your account for technical integration.
- API authentication credentials (API key or OAuth token) for secure access.
- The ID of the template(s) you want to launch for proper targeting.
- A basic understanding of REST API concepts and JSON for implementation.

These requirements ensure successful API integration and secure process automation.

### How do API-triggered Tallyfy process launches enhance workflow automation?

Tallyfy's REST API allows starting processes automatically using code - enabling sophisticated workflow automation. This enables smooth integration with other systems and allows building custom ways to launch processes based on external events or conditions.

API-triggered launches provide the highest level of automation flexibility for complex enterprise workflows.

### What are the key implementation steps for API process launching?

1. **Get authentication details**
   - Generate an API key (or set up OAuth) in your Tallyfy account settings.
   - Store credentials securely for making API requests.

2. **Find the process template ID**
   - Locate the Template ID (e.g., from the URL when viewing the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)).
   - Note any [kick-off form fields](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/) that need data.

3. **Build the API request**
   - Use the `/api/processes` endpoint with a `POST` request.
   - Include authentication headers.
   - Format the request body (**JSON**) with the template ID and process details.

4. **Handle the response**
   - Get the Process ID from a successful response.
   - Add error handling for failed requests.

For full details, including request payload formats and authentication, see the [API Process Launch Guide](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/code-samples/processes/launch-process).

### What key features does API launching provide for advanced automation?

Launching via the API offers several strategic benefits:

#### What automation capabilities are available?
- Start processes based on events in other systems for real-time workflow initiation.
- Schedule repeating process launches for recurring business activities.
- Start many processes at once (bulk launch) for efficient batch processing.

#### How does data integration work?
- Fill kick-off form fields with external data for seamless information transfer.
- Send complex data structures into processes for sophisticated workflow parameterization.
- Link Tallyfy processes to records in other systems (like a CRM) for comprehensive data connectivity.

#### What process customization options exist?
- Use custom process names for dynamic identification and organization.
- Control task assignments via code for intelligent resource allocation.
- Set custom deadlines using logic for adaptive timeline management.

These capabilities enable enterprise-grade workflow automation with sophisticated business logic.

### What does a sample API request look like?

```json
POST /api/processes HTTP/1.1
Host: go.tallyfy.com/api
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "template_id": "your-template-id",
  "name": "API Triggered Process - Customer Onboarding",
  "kickoff_fields": {
    "customer_name": "Acme Corporation",
    "contract_value": 15000,
    "start_date": "2023-05-01T00:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

### What are common business use cases for API-based Tallyfy process launching?

Launching via API is ideal for:
- Connecting a CRM to start customer onboarding when new deals close.
- Starting approval workflows from document management systems when documents are uploaded.
- Starting inspection processes from IoT devices when sensors trigger alerts.
- Creating processes from external form submissions for automated intake workflows.
- Starting workflows from database changes for real-time process automation.

These use cases demonstrate how API launching enables seamless workflow integration across diverse business systems.
