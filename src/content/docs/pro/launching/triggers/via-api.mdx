## How to launch processes via the Tallyfy API

### Requirements

Before starting, make sure you have:
- A Tallyfy account with API access enabled for your account.
- [API authentication credentials](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/code-samples/authentication/) (API key or OAuth token).
- The ID of the [template(s)](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) you want to launch.
- A basic understanding of REST API concepts and JSON.

### API-triggered process launches

Tallyfy's REST [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) allows starting [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) automatically using code. This enables smooth [integration](/products/pro/integrations/) with other systems and allows building custom ways to launch processes.

### Implementation steps

1. **Get authentication details**
   - Generate an API key (or set up OAuth) in your Tallyfy account settings.
   - Store credentials securely for making API requests.

2. **Find the process template ID**
   - Locate the Template ID (e.g., from the URL when viewing the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)).
   - Note any [kick-off form fields](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/) that need data.

3. **Build the API request**
   - Use the `/api/v1/processes` endpoint with a `POST` request.
   - Include authentication headers.
   - Format the request body (**JSON**) with the template ID and process details.

4. **Handle the response**
   - Get the Process ID from a successful response.
   - Add error handling for failed requests.

For full details, including request payload formats and authentication, see the [API Process Launch Guide](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/code-samples/processes/launch-process.mdx).

### Key features

Launching via the API offers several benefits:

#### Automation capabilities
- Start processes based on events in other systems.
- Schedule repeating process launches.
- Start many processes at once (bulk launch).

#### Data integration
- Fill [kick-off form fields](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/) with external data.
- Send complex data structures into [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).
- Link Tallyfy processes to records in other systems (like a CRM).

#### Process customization
- Use custom process names.
- Control [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) assignments via code.
- Set custom deadlines using logic.

### Sample API request

```json
POST /api/v1/processes HTTP/1.1
Host: api.tallyfy.com
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "template_id": "your-template-id",
  "name": "API Triggered Process - Customer Onboarding",
  "kickoff_fields": {
    "customer_name": "Acme Corporation",
    "contract_value": 15000,
    "start_date": "2023-05-01T00:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

### Common use cases

Launching via [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) is good for:
- Connecting a CRM to start customer onboarding.
- Starting approval workflows from document management systems.
- Starting inspection processes from IoT devices.
- Creating processes from external [form submissions](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/).
- Starting workflows from database changes.
