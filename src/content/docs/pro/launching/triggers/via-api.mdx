## Trigger a process to be launched via our open API

If you're a developer and you're currently integrating your own tools and applications with Tallyfy - you might want a convenient way of launching a process using the API.

For that, we have a dedicated article on how and what to send on the request payload. See this [article](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/how-to-start-a-process-using-tallyfy-api/) to learn more about this.
