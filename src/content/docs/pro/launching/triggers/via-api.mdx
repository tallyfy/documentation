## Launching processes via API

### Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:
- A Tallyfy account with API access enabled
- API authentication credentials (API key or OAuth token)
- The ID of the template(s) you want to launch
- A basic understanding of REST API concepts and JSON

### API workflow automation

Tallyfy's REST API lets you start processes automatically using code. You can integrate with other systems and build custom ways to launch processes based on external events or conditions.

### Implementation steps

1. **Get authentication details**
   - Generate an API key (or set up OAuth) in your Tallyfy account settings
   - Store credentials securely

2. **Find the process template ID**
   - Locate the Template ID (e.g., from the URL when viewing the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/))
   - Note any [kick-off form fields](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/) that need data

3. **Build the API request**
   - Use the `/api/processes` endpoint with a `POST` request
   - Include authentication headers
   - Format the request body (**JSON**) with the template ID and process details

4. **Handle the response**
   - Get the Process ID from a successful response
   - Add error handling for failed requests

See the [API Process Launch Guide](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/code-samples/processes/launch-process) for full details.

### API features

Launching via the API offers:

#### Automation capabilities
- Start processes based on events in other systems
- Schedule repeating process launches
- Start many processes at once (bulk launch)

#### Data integration
- Fill kick-off form fields with external data
- Send complex data structures into processes
- Link Tallyfy processes to records in other systems (like a CRM)

#### Process customization
- Use custom process names
- Control task assignments via code
- Set custom deadlines using logic

### Sample API request

```json
POST /api/processes HTTP/1.1
Host: go.tallyfy.com/api
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "template_id": "your-template-id",
  "name": "API Triggered Process - Customer Onboarding",
  "kickoff_fields": {
    "customer_name": "Acme Corporation",
    "contract_value": 15000,
    "start_date": "2023-05-01T00:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

### Common use cases

API launching works well for:
- Connecting a CRM to start customer onboarding when new deals close
- Starting approval workflows from document management systems when documents are uploaded
- Starting inspection processes from IoT devices when sensors trigger alerts
- Creating processes from external form submissions
- Starting workflows from database changes
