## How to launch processes via the Tallyfy API

### Requirements

Before implementing [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/)-triggered processes, ensure you have:
- A Tallyfy account with API access enabled
- [API authentication credentials](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/code-samples/authentication/) (API key or OAuth token)
- Knowledge of the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) IDs you wish to [launch](/products/pro/launching/)
- Basic understanding of REST API concepts and JSON

### API-triggered Process launches

Tallyfy's REST [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) enables programmatic [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) initiation for seamless [integration](/products/pro/integrations/) with external systems and applications. This method is particularly useful for automated workflows, system integrations, and creating custom launch interfaces.

### Implementation steps

1. **Obtain authentication credentials**
   - Generate an API key in your Tallyfy account settings
   - Store this key securely for API requests

2. **Identify the process template**
   - Locate the Template ID from the URL when viewing the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)
   - Note any [kickoff form fields](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/) that need to be populated

3. **Construct the API request**
   - Use the `/api/v1/processes` endpoint with a POST request
   - Include authentication in the request headers
   - Format the request body with template ID and process details

4. **Handle the API response**
   - Capture the Process ID from the successful response
   - Implement error handling for failed requests

For detailed implementation instructions, including request payload formats and authentication requirements, refer to the comprehensive [API Process Launch Guide](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/code-samples/processes/launch-process.mdx).

### Key features

API-triggered launches offer several advantages:

#### Automation capabilities
- Trigger [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) based on events in other systems
- Schedule recurring process launches
- Create bulk process initiations

#### Data integration
- Populate [kickoff form fields](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/) with external data
- Pass complex data structures into [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)
- Link processes to records in other systems

#### Process customization
- Implement custom process naming conventions
- Control [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) assignments programmatically
- Set custom deadlines based on business rules

### Sample API request

```json
POST /api/v1/processes HTTP/1.1
Host: api.tallyfy.com
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "template_id": "your-template-id",
  "name": "API Triggered Process - Customer Onboarding",
  "kickoff_fields": {
    "customer_name": "Acme Corporation",
    "contract_value": 15000,
    "start_date": "2023-05-01T00:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

### Common use cases

[API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/)-triggered [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) are ideal for:
- Connecting CRM systems to initiate customer onboarding
- Triggering approval workflows from document management systems
- [Launching](/products/pro/launching/) inspection processes from IoT devices
- Creating processes from [form submissions](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/)
- Initiating workflows based on database events
