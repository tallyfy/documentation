## Launching processes via API

Send a `POST` request to Tallyfy's REST API to launch processes from code - triggered by events in other systems like CRM deals closing or form submissions.

### What you'll need

- A Tallyfy account with API access
- An OAuth Bearer token for authentication
- The `checklist_id` (template ID) you want to launch
- Familiarity with REST APIs and JSON

### How to launch a process

1. **Get your access token** - set up OAuth in Tallyfy and store your Bearer token securely

2. **Find the template ID** - grab the `checklist_id` from the URL when viewing your [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), and note any [kick-off form fields](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/) that need data

3. **Send the POST request** - call `POST /organizations/{org_id}/runs` with your JSON body containing `checklist_id` and process details

4. **Handle the response** - a `201` response returns the new process data including its ID. Add error handling for failures.

See the [API process launch guide](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/code-samples/processes/launch-process) for full details.

### What you can do via API

- Start processes from events in other systems (CRM, forms, IoT sensors)
- Pre-fill [kick-off form fields](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/) with external data using the `prerun` object
- Set custom process names, task assignments, and deadlines per step
- Assign users, groups, and roles at launch time
- Tag processes and place them in folders automatically

### Sample API request

```json
POST /organizations/{org_id}/runs HTTP/1.1
Host: go.tallyfy.com
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json
X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient

{
  "checklist_id": "your-template-id",
  "name": "Customer Onboarding - Acme Corporation",
  "prerun": {
    "customer_name": "Acme Corporation",
    "contract_value": 15000,
    "start_date": "2024-01-15T00:00:00.000Z"
  }
}
```

### Common use cases

- CRM integration - start onboarding when deals close
- Document management - trigger approvals when files are uploaded
- IoT devices - launch inspections when sensors fire alerts
- External forms - create processes from third-party submissions
- Database triggers - start workflows from data changes
