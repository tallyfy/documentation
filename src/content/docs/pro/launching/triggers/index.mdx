## Understanding process launch triggers

Triggers are the different ways a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) can be started (launched) in Tallyfy. Some triggers are manual (a person clicks a button), while others are automatic, starting a process based on an event or a schedule.

### What you need

- A Tallyfy account with permission to launch processes.
- [Process templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) that are ready to be launched.
- An idea of how you want your processes to start.

### Different ways to trigger a process launch

Tallyfy offers several ways to start processes:

*   **Manual Launch**: A user clicks the "Launch Process" button inside Tallyfy. Simple and direct.
*   **API Trigger**: Another computer system uses code (the Tallyfy [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/)) to tell Tallyfy to launch a process. Good for connecting Tallyfy to other business software.
*   **Email Trigger**: Sending an email to a special Tallyfy address automatically launches a specific process. Useful for starting processes without logging into Tallyfy.
*   **Magic Links**: Clicking a special web link launches a process. These links can be shared or embedded in other websites or emails, and can even pre-fill some data.
*   **Schedule Trigger**: Using a [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) tool (like Zapier or Power Automate), you can set up a schedule (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) to automatically launch a process.
*   **Task Completion Trigger**: Finishing a specific task in one process can automatically launch another process. Good for linking related workflows.
*   **Kick-off Form**: Users fill out a form (either public or internal) which then launches the process, often pre-filling steps with the form answers.

### Sending data when launching

Some triggers let you automatically fill in information when the process starts:

| Trigger Type      | How Data is Sent                                     |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| API Triggers      | Include data directly in the code making the API call. |
| Magic Links       | Add data to the end of the web link (URL parameters). |
| Email Triggers    | Tallyfy can sometimes pull data from the email body.   |
| Web Forms         | Pass data from the form into the launch URL.         |
| Kick-off Forms    | Data entered into the form directly populates fields. |

This saves time and reduces errors by avoiding manual data entry.

### Choosing the right trigger

Think about:
- What should *cause* the process to start (a person, another system, a schedule)?
- Do you need to automatically fill in data when it starts?
- What technical skills does your team have?
- How often does this process need to run?

See the specific articles in this section for details on how to set up each trigger type.
