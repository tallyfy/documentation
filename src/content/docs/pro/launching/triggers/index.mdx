## Process launch triggers

Triggers are the different ways a process can be started (launched) in Tallyfy for workflow automation. Some triggers are manual (a person clicks a button), while others are automatic - starting a process based on an event or schedule.

This flexibility enables organizations to initiate workflows in ways that align with their specific operational needs and technical capabilities.

### Prerequisites

*   A Tallyfy account with permission to launch processes for security compliance.
*   Process templates ready to launch with complete configuration.
*   A clear understanding of how you want your processes to start based on business requirements.

These prerequisites ensure successful trigger implementation and proper workflow automation.

### Available trigger methods

Tallyfy provides several flexible ways to start processes based on organizational needs:

*   **Manual Launch**: A user clicks the 'Launch Process' button in Tallyfy for direct, simple initiation.
*   **API Trigger**: Another system uses code (the Tallyfy API) to tell Tallyfy to start a process, enabling seamless integration with other business software.
*   **Email Trigger**: Sending an email to a specific Tallyfy address automatically launches a process, useful for starting workflows without logging into the platform.
*   **Magic Links**: Clicking a special web link ('magic link') launches a process with the ability to share or embed links and pre-fill data automatically.
*   **Schedule Trigger**: Using middleware (like Zapier or Power Automate), you can schedule automatic launches (e.g., daily, weekly) for recurring workflows.
*   **Task Completion Trigger**: Completing a specific task in one process can launch another process, enabling seamless workflow chaining.
*   **Kick-off Form**: Filling out a form (public or internal) launches the process while often pre-filling data from the form submission.

These diverse trigger options accommodate different automation scenarios and technical skill levels.

Automated Triggers.Email -> Process: Parse and launch {

Automated Triggers.Schedule -> Process: Launch on time {
  style.stroke: "#225930"

Automated Triggers.Task -> Process: Cascade launch {

Automated Triggers.Magic -> Process: Launch via link {

  style.animated: true
}
```

**What to notice:**
- All seven trigger methods ultimately lead to the same outcome - launching a process
- Some triggers (API, Magic Links, Forms) can automatically pass data to pre-fill process fields, while manual launch cannot
- The mix of manual and automatic triggers provides flexibility for both technical and non-technical users

### Sending data automatically when launching

Some triggers let you send data automatically when the process starts, eliminating manual data entry:

| Trigger Type      | How Data is Sent                                     |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| API Triggers      | Include data in the API call code.                   |
| Magic Links       | Add data as URL parameters to the web link.          |
| Email Triggers    | Tallyfy can sometimes extract data from the email body.|
| Web Forms         | Pass form data via URL parameters.                   |
| Kick-off Forms    | Form data directly fills fields in the process.      |

This saves time and reduces errors by avoiding re-typing data.

### Choosing the right trigger

Consider these factors when selecting a trigger method:
- What event should start the process (a person, another system, a schedule) based on your workflow requirements?
- Do you need to send data automatically when it starts to reduce manual work?
- What technical skills are available on your team for implementation and maintenance?
- How often will the process run and what volume of launches do you expect?

These considerations help ensure you select the most appropriate trigger method for your specific organizational needs and technical capabilities.
