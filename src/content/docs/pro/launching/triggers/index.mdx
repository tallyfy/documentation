## Prerequisites

Before implementing process triggers, ensure you have:
- A Tallyfy account with appropriate permissions
- Active process templates ready to be triggered
- Understanding of your specific trigger requirements

## Process triggers overview

Triggers are mechanisms that initiate process launches in Tallyfy. They can be manual or automatic, providing flexibility in how workflows begin and reducing the need for constant manual intervention.

## Trigger types

Tallyfy supports several trigger methods for process initiation:

### Manual launches
Direct user-initiated process starts from the Tallyfy interface. This is the most straightforward method and gives users complete control over when processes begin.

### API triggers
Programmatic launches from external systems via Tallyfy's REST API. Ideal for integration with existing business systems and automating processes based on events in other applications.

### Email triggers
Process initiation via inbound emails sent to specialized addresses. This method allows users to start processes without logging into Tallyfy by simply sending an email.

### Magic links
URL-based process launches that can be shared or embedded in other systems. These specialized links can include parameters to populate process data automatically.

### Schedule-based triggers
Time-driven launches configured via middleware platforms. Perfect for recurring processes that need to run at regular intervals (daily, weekly, monthly).

### Task completion triggers
Processes initiated automatically when specific tasks in other processes are completed. This enables seamless process chaining for complex workflows.

## Data transfer capabilities

Certain trigger types enable automatic data population of process fields:

| Trigger Type | Data Population Method |
|--------------|------------------------|
| API triggers | Pass field values through the API payload |
| Magic links | Include parameter data in URLs |
| Email triggers | Extract content from email body and attachments |
| Web forms | Transfer form field values via URL parameters |

These mechanisms eliminate manual data entry by transferring information directly from external systems into Tallyfy processes, improving efficiency and reducing errors.

## Selecting the right trigger

When choosing a trigger type, consider:
- The source of process initiation (user, system, time-based)
- Data transfer requirements 
- Technical capabilities of your team
- Integration needs with other systems
- Frequency of process execution

For detailed implementation guidance, refer to the specific articles for each trigger type.
