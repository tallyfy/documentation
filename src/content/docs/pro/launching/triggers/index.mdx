## Process launch triggers

Triggers control how processes start in Tallyfy. Some are manual (a person clicks a button), others are automatic - fired by an event, a schedule, or another system.

### What you need

*   A Tallyfy account with permission to launch processes
*   At least one template ready to launch

### Available trigger methods

*   **Manual launch** - Click **Launch** on any template inside Tallyfy.
*   **API trigger** - Another system calls the Tallyfy API (`POST /organizations/{org}/runs`) to start a process programmatically.
*   **Email trigger** - Send an email to a template-specific Tallyfy address. The email subject becomes the process name.
*   **Magic links** - A special URL launches a process when clicked. You can embed these links in emails or websites and pre-fill data via URL parameters.
*   **Recurring schedule** - Tallyfy's built-in scheduler launches processes automatically on hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly intervals.
*   **Task completion trigger** - Completing a specific task in one process auto-launches another process, creating a chain.
*   **Kick-off form** - Submitting a form (public or internal) launches the process and fills in kick-off fields from the submission.

## Process trigger flow

All seven methods lead to the same result - a running process.

Automated Triggers.Magic -> Process: Launch via link {

}
```

### Sending data when launching

Some triggers can pre-fill kick-off form fields automatically:

| Trigger | How data is sent |
|---------|-----------------|
| API trigger | Include a `prerun` object in the API request body |
| Magic links | Append data as URL query parameters |
| Kick-off forms | Form field values map directly to kick-off fields |

This cuts manual entry and reduces errors.

### Picking the right trigger

Ask yourself:
- What event should start the process - a person, another system, or a schedule?
- Do you need data pre-filled automatically?
- How technical is your team?
- How often will the process run?
