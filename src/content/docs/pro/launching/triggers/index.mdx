## Prerequisites

Before implementing [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) triggers, ensure you have:
- A Tallyfy account with appropriate permissions
- Active [process templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) ready to be triggered
- Understanding of your specific trigger requirements

## Process triggers overview

Triggers are mechanisms that initiate [process launches](/products/pro/launching/) in Tallyfy. They can be manual or automatic, providing flexibility in how workflows begin and reducing the need for constant manual intervention.

## Trigger types

Tallyfy supports several trigger methods for process initiation:

### Manual launches
Direct user-initiated [process starts](/products/pro/launching/) from the Tallyfy interface. This is the most straightforward method and gives users complete control over when processes begin.

### [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) triggers
Programmatic launches from external systems via Tallyfy's REST API. Ideal for integration with existing business systems and automating [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) based on events in other applications.

### Email triggers
[Process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) initiation via inbound emails sent to specialized addresses. This method allows users to start processes without logging into Tallyfy by simply sending an email.

### Magic links
URL-based [process launches](/products/pro/launching/) that can be shared or embedded in other systems. These specialized links can include parameters to populate process data automatically.

### Schedule-based triggers
Time-driven launches configured via [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) platforms. Perfect for recurring [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) that need to run at regular intervals (daily, weekly, monthly).

### [Task completion triggers](/products/pro/launching/launch-process-when-task-is-completed/)
[Processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) initiated automatically when specific [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in other processes are completed. This enables seamless process chaining for complex workflows.

## Data transfer capabilities

Certain trigger types enable automatic data population of [process fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/):

| Trigger Type | Data Population Method |
|--------------|------------------------|
| [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) triggers | Pass [field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) values through the API payload |
| Magic links | Include parameter data in URLs |
| Email triggers | Extract content from email body and attachments |
| Web forms | Transfer [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) values via URL parameters |

These mechanisms eliminate manual data entry by transferring information directly from external systems into Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), improving efficiency and reducing errors.

## Selecting the right trigger

When choosing a trigger type, consider:
- The source of process initiation (user, system, time-based)
- Data transfer requirements 
- Technical capabilities of your team
- [Integration](/products/pro/integrations/) needs with other systems
- Frequency of process execution

For detailed implementation guidance, refer to the specific articles for each trigger type.
