## Understanding process launch triggers

Triggers are the different ways a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) can be started (launched) in Tallyfy. Some triggers are manual (a person clicks a button), while others are automatic, starting a process based on an event or schedule.

### What you need

*   A Tallyfy account with permission to launch processes.
*   [Process templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) ready to launch.
*   An idea of how you want your processes to start.

### Different ways to trigger a process launch

Tallyfy provides several ways to start processes:

*   **Manual Launch**: A user clicks the 'Launch Process' button in Tallyfy. Simple, direct way.
*   **API Trigger**: Another system uses code (the Tallyfy [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/)) to tell Tallyfy to start a process. Good for connecting Tallyfy to other business software.
*   **Email Trigger**: Sending an email to a specific Tallyfy address automatically launches a process. Useful for starting workflows without logging into Tallyfy.
*   **Magic Links**: Clicking a special web link ('magic link') launches a process. These links can be shared or embedded, and can pre-fill data.
*   **Schedule Trigger**: Using [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) (like Zapier or Power Automate), you can schedule automatic launches (e.g., daily, weekly).
*   **Task Completion Trigger**: Completing a specific task in one process can launch another process. Good for linking workflows.
*   **Kick-off Form**: Filling out a form (public or internal) launches the process, often pre-filling data from the form.

### Sending data when launching

Some triggers let you send data automatically when the process starts:

| Trigger Type      | How Data is Sent                                     |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| API Triggers      | Include data in the API call code.                   |
| Magic Links       | Add data as URL parameters to the web link.          |
| Email Triggers    | Tallyfy can sometimes extract data from the email body.|
| Web Forms         | Pass form data via URL parameters.                   |
| Kick-off Forms    | Form data directly fills fields in the process.      |

This saves time and reduces errors by avoiding re-typing data.

### Choosing the right trigger

Think about:
- What event should start the process (a person, another system, a schedule)?
- Do you need to send data automatically when it starts?
- What technical skills are available on your team?
- How often will the process run?

See the specific articles in this section for details on how to set up each trigger type.
