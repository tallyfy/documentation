---

## Process triggers overview

Triggers are mechanisms that initiate process launches in Tallyfy. They can be manual or automatic, providing flexibility in how workflows begin.

## Trigger types

Tallyfy supports several trigger methods:

* **Manual launches** - Direct user-initiated process starts
* **API triggers** - Programmatic launches from external systems
* **Email triggers** - Process initiation via inbound emails
* **Magic links** - URL-based process launches
* **Schedule-based** - Time-driven launches via middleware
* **Task completion** - Processes triggered by completion of tasks in other processes

## Data transfer capabilities

Certain trigger types enable automatic data population of process fields:

* **API triggers** - Pass field values through the API payload
* **Magic links** - Include parameter data in URLs
* **Email triggers** - Extract content from email body and attachments

These mechanisms eliminate manual data entry by transferring information directly from external systems into Tallyfy processes.
