## Triggers are ways to launch a process

Triggers are different ways you can launch a process manually or automatically.

You can use automatic triggers to launch a process, such as via email or magic link if there's no required kick-off fields set on the process.

Certain triggers like magic links or API triggers allow you to send in the data needed for kick-off fields from other systems into Tallyfy, avoiding the need for anyone to re-type data into kick-off fields.
