## Schedule recurring process launches

### Prerequisites

- A Tallyfy account with the right permissions
- Process templates ready for scheduled launch
- Access to middleware platforms (like Zapier, Make.com) or API capabilities
- Your schedule needs (daily, weekly, monthly)

### Benefits

Automatic launches run repeating workflows (daily, weekly, monthly) on time without manual intervention.

### Implementation options

### 1. Middleware platforms

Schedule through Zapier, Make.com, or Microsoft Power Automate.

**Implementation steps:**
<Steps>
1. Sign up for your chosen [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) platform.
2. Connect it to your Tallyfy account.
3. Create a new workflow/scenario with a schedule trigger.
4. Set the schedule (time, day, frequency).
5. Add a Tallyfy action to [launch](/products/pro/launching/) a specific [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).
6. Set the process name format and fill any required [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/).
7. Test and turn on the scheduled launch.
</Steps>

**Example: Daily equipment check**
```
Trigger: Schedule (Every day at 8:00 AM)
Action: [Launch](/products/pro/launching/) Tallyfy [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)
Template: Equipment Safety Check
Process name: Equipment Check - {date}
```

### 2. API-based scheduling

Build custom solutions using the Tallyfy API with server-side schedulers.

**Implementation steps:**
<Steps>
1. Write a server-side script that calls the Tallyfy API.
2. Set up the script to launch specific [process templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).
3. Set up a task scheduler (like cron job, Windows Task Scheduler).
4. Schedule the script to run at the desired times.
5. Add logging and error handling.
6. Test thoroughly.
</Steps>

**Example: Node.js script**
```javascript
const cron = require('node-cron');
const axios = require('axios');

// Schedule task to run at 9:00 AM every Monday
cron.schedule('0 9 * * 1', async () => {
  try {
    await axios.post('https://go.tallyfy.com/api/processes', {
      template_id: 'your-template-id',
      name: `Weekly Report - ${new Date().toLocaleDateString()}`
    }, {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      }
    });
    console.log('Weekly report process launched successfully');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to launch process:', error);
  }
});
```

### 3. Integrated workflows

Trigger from existing systems (ERP, HRIS) that already have scheduling capabilities.

**Implementation steps:**
<Steps>
1. Identify scheduling systems already used (ERP, HRIS, etc.).
2. Set up [integration](/products/pro/integrations/) points between these systems and Tallyfy.
3. Trigger based on scheduled events in those systems.
4. Map data from the source system to Tallyfy [process fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/).
5. Test the integration thoroughly.
</Steps>

### Recommended approach

Middleware schedulers are the simplest solution. See our Monthly Process Launch with Zapier guide for a detailed example.

### Common use cases

| Process Type | Frequency | Example Implementation |
|--------------|-----------|------------------------|
| Compliance audits | Monthly | Schedule equipment inspection process on the 1st of each month |
| Financial reporting | Weekly | Launch expense approval workflow every Friday at 4:00 PM |
| Team updates | Daily | Trigger daily standup checklist each morning at 9:00 AM |
| Maintenance checks | Quarterly | Schedule facility inspection process on the first day of each quarter |
| Client reviews | Annually | Launch client satisfaction survey process on client anniversary dates |

:::note[Process naming]
For scheduled [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), use consistent names that include the date/time for easier tracking. Example: "Monthly Compliance Check - May 2023"
