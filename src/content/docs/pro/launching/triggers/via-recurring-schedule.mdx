## How to launch processes on a recurring schedule

## Requirements

Before implementing scheduled [process launches](/products/pro/launching/), ensure you have:
- A Tallyfy account with appropriate permissions
- [Process templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) ready for scheduled execution
- Access to [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) platforms or [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) capabilities
- Clear understanding of your recurring process needs

## Recurring process scheduling

For repeating workflows that need to run on a consistent schedule (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.), implementing an automated [launch](/products/pro/launching/) mechanism improves process consistency and reduces manual intervention. Scheduled launches ensure critical business [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) run on time without requiring manual initiation.

## Implementation options

Recurring [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) can be implemented through several methods:

### 1. Middleware platforms

Use scheduling capabilities in tools like Zapier, Make.com, or Microsoft Power Automate.

**Implementation steps:**
<Steps>
1. Create an account on your preferred [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) platform
2. Connect the platform to your Tallyfy account
3. Create a new [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) with a schedule trigger
4. Configure the schedule (time, day, frequency)
5. Add a Tallyfy action to [launch](/products/pro/launching/) a specific [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)
6. Set process name format and populate any required [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/)
7. Test and activate the scheduled launch
</Steps>

**Example: Daily equipment check at 8:00 AM**
```
Trigger: Schedule (Every day at 8:00 AM)
Action: [Launch](/products/pro/launching/) Tallyfy [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)
Template: Equipment Safety Check
Process name: Equipment Check - {date}
```

### 2. API scheduling

Implement a custom scheduling solution using the Tallyfy [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) and a server-side scheduler.

**Implementation steps:**
<Steps>
1. Create a server-side script that calls the Tallyfy API
2. Configure the script to launch specific [process templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)
3. Set up a scheduler (cron job, Windows Task Scheduler, etc.)
4. Schedule the script to run at desired intervals
5. Implement logging and error handling
6. Test across multiple schedule iterations
</Steps>

**Example: Node.js script with cron**
```javascript
const cron = require('node-cron');
const axios = require('axios');

// Schedule task to run at 9:00 AM every Monday
cron.schedule('0 9 * * 1', async () => {
  try {
    await axios.post('https://api.tallyfy.com/api/v1/processes', {
      template_id: 'your-template-id',
      name: `Weekly Report - ${new Date().toLocaleDateString()}`
    }, {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      }
    });
    console.log('Weekly report process launched successfully');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to launch process:', error);
  }
});
```

### 3. Integrated workflows

Connect to existing scheduling systems in your organization that can trigger Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).

**Implementation steps:**
<Steps>
1. Identify scheduling systems already in use (ERP, HRIS, etc.)
2. Configure [integration](/products/pro/integrations/) points between these systems and Tallyfy
3. Set up triggers based on scheduled events in these systems
4. Map data from source systems to Tallyfy [process fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/)
5. Test the integration under various timing scenarios
</Steps>

## Recommended approach

The straightforward current solution is to use [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) with scheduling triggers. For a detailed implementation example, see our [Monthly Process Launch with Zapier](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/zapier/how-to-automate-monthly-process-launch-with-zapier/) guide.

## Common scheduling use cases with examples

| Process Type | Frequency | Example Implementation |
|--------------|-----------|------------------------|
| Compliance audits | Monthly | Schedule equipment inspection process on the 1st of each month |
| Financial reporting | Weekly | Launch expense approval workflow every Friday at 4:00 PM |
| Team updates | Daily | Trigger daily standup checklist each morning at 9:00 AM |
| Maintenance checks | Quarterly | Schedule facility inspection [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) on the first day of each quarter |
| Client reviews | Annually | [Launch](/products/pro/launching/) client satisfaction survey process on client anniversary dates |

:::note[Process naming]
For scheduled [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), use consistent naming conventions that include the date/time of execution for easy identification. Example: "Monthly Compliance Check - May 2023"
