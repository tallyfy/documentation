## How do I launch processes on a recurring schedule?

You can auto-launch [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) on a repeating schedule - daily, weekly, monthly, or at any interval you need. The easiest way is through a [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) platform like Zapier, Make.com, or Power Automate. You can also write a custom script that calls the Tallyfy API on a cron schedule.

### What you'll need

- A Tallyfy account with process launch permission (Admin, template owner, or granted launch access)
- A published [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) ready to launch
- A middleware account (Zapier, Make.com, Power Automate) or a server where you can run scheduled scripts

### Option 1 - Middleware platforms

This is the fastest approach. No coding required.

<Steps>
1. Connect your [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) platform to Tallyfy.
2. Create a new workflow with a **Schedule** trigger.
3. Set the frequency (time, day, interval).
4. Add a Tallyfy **Launch Process** action pointing to your template.
5. Set the process name format and fill any required [kick-off form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/).
6. Test and activate.
</Steps>

**Example - daily equipment check:**
```
Trigger: Schedule (Every day at 8:00 AM)
Action: Launch Tallyfy process
Template: Equipment Safety Check
Process name: Equipment Check - {date}
```

### Option 2 - API with a cron job

Write a server-side script and schedule it with cron (Linux/Mac) or Task Scheduler (Windows).

<Steps>
1. Write a script that calls `POST /organizations/{org}/runs` with your `checklist_id`.
2. Schedule it using cron or another task scheduler.
3. Add logging and error handling.
4. Test before going live.
</Steps>

**Example - Node.js script launching every Monday at 9 AM:**
```javascript
const cron = require('node-cron');
const axios = require('axios');

cron.schedule('0 9 * * 1', async () => {
  try {
    await axios.post('https://go.tallyfy.com/api/organizations/YOUR_ORG_ID/runs', {
      checklist_id: 'your-template-timeline-id',
      name: `Weekly Report - ${new Date().toLocaleDateString()}`
    }, {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN',
        'X-Tallyfy-Client': 'APIClient',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      }
    });
    console.log('Process launched');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Launch failed:', error);
  }
});
```

### Option 3 - Trigger from existing systems

If you already use an ERP, HRIS, or another system with scheduling, you can have it call the Tallyfy API directly or go through middleware.

<Steps>
1. Identify which system already runs scheduled jobs.
2. Set up an [integration](/products/pro/integrations/) from that system to Tallyfy.
3. Map data from the source system to Tallyfy [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/).
4. Test the end-to-end flow.
</Steps>

### Common use cases

| Process type | Frequency | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Compliance audits | Monthly | Launch inspection process on the 1st of each month |
| Financial reporting | Weekly | Launch expense approval every Friday at 4 PM |
| Team updates | Daily | Launch standup checklist each morning at 9 AM |
| Maintenance checks | Quarterly | Launch facility inspection on the first day of each quarter |

:::note[Process naming]
For scheduled [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), include the date in the name for easy tracking. Example: "Monthly Compliance Check - January 2026"
