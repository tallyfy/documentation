title: Launch via a schedule

## Recurring process scheduling

For repeating workflows that need to run on a consistent schedule (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.), implementing an automated launch mechanism improves process consistency and reduces manual intervention.

## Current implementation options

While native scheduling functionality is under development, recurring processes can be implemented using third-party middleware solutions:

1. **Middleware platforms** - Use scheduling capabilities in tools like Zapier, Make.com, or Microsoft Power Automate
2. **API scheduling** - Implement a custom scheduling solution using the Tallyfy API
3. **Integrated workflows** - Connect to existing scheduling systems in your organization

## Recommended approach

The most straightforward current solution is to use middleware with scheduling triggers. For a detailed implementation example, see our [Monthly Process Launch with Zapier](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/zapier/how-to-automate-monthly-process-launch-with-zapier/) guide.

## Common scheduling use cases

* Regular compliance audits
* Monthly reporting processes
* Weekly status update workflows
* Daily operational checklists
* Quarterly review processes
