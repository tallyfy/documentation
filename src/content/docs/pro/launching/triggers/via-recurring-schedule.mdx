## How can I launch Tallyfy processes on a recurring schedule for automation?

### What prerequisites are needed for scheduled process launches?

Before setting up scheduled process launches, make sure you have:
- A TallyfyÂ® account with the right permissions for process management.
- Process templates ready for scheduled launch with complete configuration.
- Access to middleware platforms (like Zapier, Make.com) or API capabilities for automation.
- A clear idea of your schedule needs (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) based on business requirements.

These requirements ensure successful implementation of automated recurring workflows.

### Why is recurring Tallyfy process scheduling essential for business operations?

For workflows that need to repeat on a consistent schedule (daily, weekly, monthly), setting up automatic launches improves consistency and reduces manual work. Scheduled launches ensure important business processes run on time - without needing someone to start them manually.

This automation eliminates human error and ensures critical workflows never get missed due to oversight or absence.

### What implementation options are available for recurring process scheduling?

Repeating processes can be set up in several ways based on your technical capabilities and infrastructure:

### 1. How can middleware platforms enable automated scheduling?

Use scheduling features in tools like Zapier, Make.com, or Microsoft Power Automate for user-friendly automation.

**Implementation steps:**
<Steps>
1. Sign up for your chosen [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) platform.
2. Connect it to your Tallyfy account.
3. Create a new workflow/scenario with a schedule trigger.
4. Set the schedule (time, day, frequency).
5. Add a Tallyfy action to [launch](/products/pro/launching/) a specific [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).
6. Set the process name format and fill any required [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/).
7. Test and turn on the scheduled launch.
</Steps>

**Example: Daily equipment check**
```
Trigger: Schedule (Every day at 8:00 AM)
Action: [Launch](/products/pro/launching/) Tallyfy [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)
Template: Equipment Safety Check
Process name: Equipment Check - {date}
```

### 2. How can I implement API-based scheduling for custom solutions?

Build a custom solution using the Tallyfy API and a scheduler on your server for maximum control and flexibility.

**Implementation steps:**
<Steps>
1. Write a server-side script that calls the Tallyfy API.
2. Set up the script to launch specific [process templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).
3. Set up a task scheduler (like cron job, Windows Task Scheduler).
4. Schedule the script to run at the desired times.
5. Add logging and error handling.
6. Test thoroughly.
</Steps>

**Example: Node.js script**
```javascript
const cron = require('node-cron');
const axios = require('axios');

// Schedule task to run at 9:00 AM every Monday
cron.schedule('0 9 * * 1', async () => {
  try {
    await axios.post('https://api.tallyfy.com/api/v1/processes', {
      template_id: 'your-template-id',
      name: `Weekly Report - ${new Date().toLocaleDateString()}`
    }, {
      headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      }
    });
    console.log('Weekly report process launched successfully');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to launch process:', error);
  }
});
```

### 3. How can integrated workflows leverage existing business systems?

Connect to existing systems in your company (like ERP, HRIS) that can trigger Tallyfy processes for seamless enterprise integration.

**Implementation steps:**
<Steps>
1. Identify scheduling systems already used (ERP, HRIS, etc.).
2. Set up [integration](/products/pro/integrations/) points between these systems and Tallyfy.
3. Trigger based on scheduled events in those systems.
4. Map data from the source system to Tallyfy [process fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/).
5. Test the integration thoroughly.
</Steps>

### What is the recommended approach for most organizations?

The simplest current solution is to use middleware schedulers for ease of setup and maintenance. For a detailed example, see our Monthly Process Launch with Zapier guide for step-by-step implementation.

This approach requires minimal technical expertise while providing robust scheduling capabilities.

### What are common business use cases for scheduled process launches?

| Process Type | Frequency | Example Implementation |
|--------------|-----------|------------------------|
| Compliance audits | Monthly | Schedule equipment inspection process on the 1st of each month for regulatory adherence |
| Financial reporting | Weekly | Launch expense approval workflow every Friday at 4:00 PM for consistent reporting |
| Team updates | Daily | Trigger daily standup checklist each morning at 9:00 AM for team coordination |
| Maintenance checks | Quarterly | Schedule facility inspection process on the first day of each quarter for preventive maintenance |
| Client reviews | Annually | Launch client satisfaction survey process on client anniversary dates for relationship management |

These examples demonstrate how scheduled launches support various business functions and compliance requirements.

:::note[Process naming]
For scheduled [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), use consistent names that include the date/time for easier tracking. Example: "Monthly Compliance Check - May 2023"
