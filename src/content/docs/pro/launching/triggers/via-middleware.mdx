## Understanding middleware integration

Middleware platforms serve as intermediary systems that facilitate data exchange between Tallyfy and other applications. They enable process initiation based on events in external systems without requiring custom coding.

## Functionality

Middleware connects disparate systems through pre-built connectors, allowing you to:

* Launch Tallyfy processes from external triggers
* Pass data from external systems into Tallyfy processes
* Populate kickoff form fields automatically
* Initiate workflows based on form submissions from other platforms

## Form integration capabilities

Middleware especially enhances integration with form-building applications that lack robust process management features, such as:

* Google Forms
* Microsoft Forms
* Typeform
* Wufoo
* Cognito Forms

When users submit forms in these applications, middleware can automatically launch corresponding Tallyfy processes with the submitted data.

## Recommended middleware platforms

Several middleware platforms offer Tallyfy connectors:

* **Make.com** (Recommended) - Comprehensive integration capabilities
* **Microsoft Power Automate** (Recommended) - [Detailed integration guide](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/)
* **Pabbly** (Basic) - Newer option with fundamental functionality
* **Zapier** (Not recommended for complex scenarios) - [Integration information](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/zapier/)

Selection should be based on your specific integration requirements, complexity, and budget considerations.
