  exchange and process automation between Tallyfy and external applications through
  pre-built connectors and form integration capabilities.
title: Launch via middleware
---

## Prerequisites

Before implementing middleware integrations, ensure you have:
- A Tallyfy account with appropriate permissions
- Access to your chosen middleware platform (Make.com, Power Automate, etc.)
- Process templates ready for integration
- Understanding of the external systems you wish to connect

## Understanding middleware integration

Middleware platforms serve as intermediary systems that facilitate data exchange between Tallyfy and other applications. They enable process initiation based on events in external systems without requiring custom coding or direct API implementation.

## How middleware works with Tallyfy

1. **Connection establishment**: Middleware platforms connect to Tallyfy using authentication credentials
2. **Trigger definition**: You define events in external systems that should initiate processes
3. **Data mapping**: The middleware maps data from external systems to Tallyfy fields
4. **Process execution**: When triggered, the middleware launches processes with mapped data

## Key functionality

Middleware connects disparate systems through pre-built connectors, allowing you to:

* Launch Tallyfy processes from external triggers (form submissions, calendar events, database changes)
* Pass data from external systems into Tallyfy processes automatically
* Populate kickoff form fields without manual entry
* Transform data between systems to ensure compatibility
* Apply conditional logic to determine when processes should launch

## Form integration capabilities

Middleware especially enhances integration with form-building applications that lack robust process management features:

| Form Platform | Integration Capability | Data Transfer |
|---------------|------------------------|---------------|
| Google Forms | High - native connectors | All form fields |
| Microsoft Forms | High - native connectors | All form fields |
| Typeform | Medium - via webhooks | All form fields |
| Wufoo | Medium - via webhooks | All form fields |
| Cognito Forms | Medium - via webhooks | All form fields |

When users submit forms in these applications, middleware can automatically launch corresponding Tallyfy processes with the submitted data.

## Implementation guidance by platform

### Make.com (Recommended)
- Offers the most flexible Tallyfy integration
- Supports complex data transformations
- Allows multi-step workflows before process launch
- Provides error handling and retry mechanisms

### Microsoft Power Automate (Recommended)
- Deep integration with Microsoft ecosystem
- User-friendly interface for business users
- Strong security and compliance features
- [Detailed integration guide available](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/)

### Zapier (Basic integration)
- Simple to set up for straightforward connections
- Limited data transformation capabilities
- Best for basic form-to-process scenarios
- [View Zapier integration information](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/zapier/)

### Pabbly (Alternative option)
- Newer platform with fundamental functionality
- More affordable pricing structure
- Fewer advanced features than Make.com
- Growing connector library

## Selection criteria

Choose your middleware platform based on:
- Technical complexity of your integration needs
- Budget constraints
- Existing system ecosystem
- Required transformation capabilities
- Team's technical expertise
