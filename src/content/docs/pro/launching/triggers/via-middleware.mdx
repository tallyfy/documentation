## How to launch processes via middleware

## Requirements

Before implementing [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) integrations, ensure you have:
- A Tallyfy account with appropriate permissions
- Access to your chosen middleware platform (Make.com, Power Automate, etc.)
- [Process templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) ready for integration
- Understanding of the external systems you wish to connect

## Understanding middleware integration

[Middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) platforms serve as intermediary systems that facilitate data exchange between Tallyfy and other applications. They enable [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) initiation based on events in external systems without requiring custom coding or direct [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) implementation.

## How middleware works with Tallyfy

1. **Connection establishment**: Middleware platforms connect to Tallyfy using authentication credentials
2. **Trigger definition**: You define events in external systems that should initiate [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)
3. **Data mapping**: The middleware maps data from external systems to Tallyfy [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/)
4. **Process execution**: When triggered, the middleware [launches](/products/pro/launching/) processes with mapped data

## Key functionality

[Middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) connects disparate systems through pre-built connectors, allowing you to:

* [Launch](/products/pro/launching/) Tallyfy processes from external triggers (form submissions, calendar events, database changes)
* Pass data from external systems into Tallyfy processes automatically
* Populate kickoff [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) without manual entry
* Transform data between systems to ensure compatibility
* Apply conditional logic to determine when processes should launch

## Form integration capabilities

Middleware especially enhances integration with form-building applications that lack robust process management features:

| Form Platform | Integration Capability | Data Transfer |
|---------------|------------------------|---------------|
| Google Forms | High - native connectors | All form fields |
| Microsoft Forms | High - native connectors | All form fields |
| Typeform | Medium - via webhooks | All form fields |
| Wufoo | Medium - via webhooks | All form fields |
| Cognito Forms | Medium - via webhooks | All form fields |

When users submit forms in these applications, [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) can automatically [launch](/products/pro/launching/) corresponding Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) with the submitted data.

## Implementation guidance by platform

### Make.com (Recommended)
- Offers the most flexible Tallyfy integration
- Supports complex data transformations
- Allows multi-step workflows before process launch
- Provides error handling and retry mechanisms

### Microsoft Power Automate (Recommended)
- Deep integration with Microsoft ecosystem
- User-friendly interface for business users
- Strong security and compliance features
- [Detailed integration guide available](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/)

### Zapier (Basic integration)
- Simple to set up for straightforward connections
- Limited data transformation capabilities
- Best for basic form-to-process scenarios
- [View Zapier integration information](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/zapier/)

### Pabbly (Alternative option)
- Newer platform with fundamental functionality
- More affordable pricing structure
- Fewer advanced features than Make.com
- Growing connector library

## Selection criteria

Choose your middleware platform based on:
- Technical complexity of your integration needs
- Budget constraints
- Existing system ecosystem
- Required transformation capabilities
- Team's technical expertise
