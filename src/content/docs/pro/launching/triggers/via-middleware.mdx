## What is middleware?

Middleware platforms sit in between two apps - Tallyfy and something else. That's why it's called "middleware" because it just sits in the middle and moves data between apps.

You can even listen to form submissions in other apps and pass through the data into Tallyfy. Examples of apps that make standalone forms with little or no post-submit tracking are Google Forms, Microsoft Forms, Typeform, Wufoo, Cognito Forms, etc.

Middleware platforms use "connectors" to allow you to integrate any apps you like.

Here's some examples of platforms which have Tallyfy connectors:

- (Recommended) - Make.com
- (Recommended) - [Microsoft Power Automate](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/)
- (New-ish, Basic) - Pabbly
- (Expensive, Not Recommended) [Zapier](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/zapier/)
