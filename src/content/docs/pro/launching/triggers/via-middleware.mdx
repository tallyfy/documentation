  external applications through triggers and data mapping without requiring custom
  code development.

## How to launch processes using middleware

### What you need

*   A Tallyfy account with permission to launch Tallyfy processes.
*   An account with a [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) platform (e.g., Make.com, Power Automate, Zapier).
*   A Tallyfy [process template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) to launch automatically.
*   Access to the system (e.g., CRM, form tool, database) that will trigger the launch.

### What is middleware integration?

[Middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) tools act like a bridge between Tallyfy and other software. They watch for an event in another application (the "trigger") and then automatically tell Tallyfy to start a specific process, often sending data too. This lets you start Tallyfy workflows based on outside events, without custom coding.

### How middleware launches Tallyfy processes

1.  **Connect**: Connect your middleware tool to Tallyfy and the other app using your account details.
2.  **Trigger**: Set up a trigger in the middleware â€“ what event in the other app should start things? (e.g., "New contact added in HubSpot", "Form submitted in Typeform").
3.  **Map Data**: Tell the middleware how to map data from the trigger app to the [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) in your Tallyfy kick-off form.
4.  **Launch Action**: Add an action in the middleware to "Launch Process" in Tallyfy, using the mapped data.
5.  **Run**: When the trigger happens, the middleware automatically launches the Tallyfy process with the data.

### What can middleware connect to Tallyfy?

Middleware makes it easy to:

*   Start Tallyfy processes based on events in other tools (new CRM deal, calendar event, database update).
*   Automatically send data from those tools into the Tallyfy process.
*   Automatically fill Tallyfy kick-off [forms](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/).
*   Change data formats between systems if needed.
*   Add logic (e.g., only launch the Tallyfy process if a certain condition is met in the other tool).

### Example: Connecting online forms

Middleware is great for connecting form tools (like Google Forms, Typeform) to Tallyfy. When someone submits the form, the middleware can take the answers and use them to launch a Tallyfy process.

| Form Tool         | Connection Difficulty | Data Sent         |
|-------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| Google Forms      | Easy (Built-in Connector)| All form answers  |
| Microsoft Forms   | Easy (Built-in Connector)| All form answers  |
| Typeform          | Medium (Webhook)      | All form answers  |
| Wufoo             | Medium (Webhook)      | All form answers  |
| Cognito Forms     | Medium (Webhook)      | All form answers  |

### Choosing a middleware platform

*   **Make.com (Recommended)**: Very flexible, good for complex mapping.
*   **Microsoft Power Automate (Recommended)**: Good choice if you use Microsoft 365.
*   **Zapier**: Simple, wide app support.
*   **Pabbly**: Often affordable, good basic features.
*   **Workato / Tray.io**: More powerful, for enterprise/complex needs.

Consider:
*   How complex is the connection?
*   What is your budget?
*   Which apps do you use?
*   How much data changing is needed?
*   Team's technical comfort.

### General steps to set up

1.  **Plan**: Decide which event/app should trigger which Tallyfy launch.
2.  **Choose**: Select your middleware tool.
3.  **Build**: Create the workflow/scenario: set trigger, add Tallyfy "Launch Process" action, map data.
4.  **Test**: Test to ensure processes launch correctly with the right data.
5.  **Activate**: Turn on your workflow/scenario.
