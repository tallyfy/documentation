## How can I launch processes using middleware for seamless automation?

### What prerequisites are needed for middleware-based process launching?

*   A Tallyfy® account with permission to launch Tallyfy® processes for workflow automation.
*   An account with a middleware platform (e.g., Make.com, Power Automate, Zapier) for integration capabilities.
*   A Tallyfy® process template to launch automatically with complete configuration.
*   Access to the system (e.g., CRM, form tool, database) that will trigger the launch for data source connectivity.

These requirements ensure successful middleware integration and automated workflow initiation.

### How does middleware integration work for workflow automation?

Middleware tools act like a bridge between Tallyfy and other software systems. They watch for an event in another application (the "trigger") and then automatically tell Tallyfy to start a specific process, often sending data too. This lets you start Tallyfy workflows based on outside events, without custom coding.

This integration approach eliminates manual workflow initiation and creates seamless automation between disparate business systems.

### How does the middleware process launching workflow function?

1.  **Connect**: Connect your middleware tool to Tallyfy and the other app using your account details for secure integration.
2.  **Trigger**: Set up a trigger in the middleware – what event in the other app should start things? (e.g., "New contact added in HubSpot", "Form submitted in Typeform").
3.  **Map Data**: Tell the middleware how to map data from the trigger app to the fields in your Tallyfy kick-off form for proper data transfer.
4.  **Launch Action**: Add an action in the middleware to "Launch Process" in Tallyfy, using the mapped data for automated execution.
5.  **Run**: When the trigger happens, the middleware automatically launches the Tallyfy process with the data for seamless workflow initiation.

This systematic approach ensures reliable and consistent process automation across different business systems.

### What capabilities does middleware provide for Tallyfy integration?

Middleware makes it easy to create sophisticated automation:

*   Start Tallyfy processes based on events in other tools (new CRM deal, calendar event, database update) for real-time workflow initiation.
*   Automatically send data from those tools into the Tallyfy process for seamless information transfer.
*   Automatically fill Tallyfy kick-off forms with external data for streamlined process setup.
*   Change data formats between systems if needed for compatibility and standardization.
*   Add logic (e.g., only launch the Tallyfy process if a certain condition is met in the other tool) for intelligent automation.

These capabilities enable sophisticated business process automation without requiring custom development.

### How can I connect online forms for automated workflow initiation?

Middleware is excellent for connecting form tools (like Google Forms, Typeform) to Tallyfy. When someone submits the form, the middleware can take the answers and use them to launch a Tallyfy process automatically.

This integration transforms static form submissions into dynamic workflow initiation with all submitted data.

| Form Tool         | Connection Difficulty | Data Sent         |
|-------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| Google Forms      | Easy (Built-in Connector)| All form answers  |
| Microsoft Forms   | Easy (Built-in Connector)| All form answers  |
| Typeform          | Medium (Webhook)      | All form answers  |
| Wufoo             | Medium (Webhook)      | All form answers  |
| Cognito Forms     | Medium (Webhook)      | All form answers  |

### How should I choose the right middleware platform for my needs?

*   **Make.com (Recommended)**: Very flexible, good for complex mapping and advanced automation scenarios.
*   **Microsoft Power Automate (Recommended)**: Good choice if you use Microsoft 365 for seamless ecosystem integration.
*   **Zapier**: Simple, wide app support for straightforward automation needs.
*   **Pabbly**: Often affordable, good basic features for budget-conscious organizations.
*   **Workato / Tray.io**: More powerful, for enterprise/complex needs requiring advanced capabilities.

Consider these factors when choosing:
*   How complex is the connection and data transformation requirements?
*   What is your budget for integration platform subscriptions?
*   Which apps do you use in your current technology stack?
*   How much data changing is needed for compatibility?
*   Team's technical comfort level with different platforms?

These considerations ensure you select the most appropriate platform for your specific integration requirements.

### What are the general steps for setting up middleware integration?

1.  **Plan**: Decide which event/app should trigger which Tallyfy launch based on your business requirements.
2.  **Choose**: Select your middleware tool based on capabilities, budget, and technical requirements.
3.  **Build**: Create the workflow/scenario: set trigger, add Tallyfy "Launch Process" action, map data appropriately.
4.  **Test**: Test to ensure processes launch correctly with the right data and proper error handling.
5.  **Activate**: Turn on your workflow/scenario and monitor for successful operation.

This systematic approach ensures reliable middleware integration and successful automation deployment.
