## How can I launch Tallyfy processes using middleware?

### What you'll need

*   A Tallyfy account with launch permission (Admin, template owner, or granted PROCESS_LAUNCH access)
*   An account on a middleware platform (Make.com, Power Automate, or Zapier)
*   A published Tallyfy template ready to launch
*   Access to the external system that'll trigger launches (CRM, form tool, database, etc.)

### How middleware launching works

Middleware tools bridge Tallyfy and your other apps. They watch for an event in another application (the "trigger"), then automatically call the Tallyfy API to start a process - passing data along. No custom coding required.

### The 5-step flow

1.  **Connect** - Link your middleware tool to Tallyfy and the trigger app using API credentials.
2.  **Trigger** - Pick the event that should start things (e.g., "New contact in HubSpot", "Form submitted in Typeform").
3.  **Map data** - Map fields from the trigger app to your Tallyfy kick-off form fields (the `prerun` data).
4.  **Launch action** - Add a "Launch Process" action pointing to your Tallyfy template's `checklist_id`.
5.  **Run** - When the trigger fires, middleware auto-launches the Tallyfy process with mapped data.

### Visualizing the middleware integration flow

This diagram shows how external applications trigger Tallyfy processes through middleware platforms.

# Middleware Integration Flow
direction: down

# Source System
External_App: External Application {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#f2faf4"
  label: "External App\n(CRM, Forms, etc.)"
}

# Integration Layer
Middleware: Middleware Platform {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#f2faf4"
  label: "Middleware\n(Zapier, Make, Power Automate)"
}

# Target System
Tallyfy: Tallyfy Platform {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#e1f7e6"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.stroke-width: 2
}

# Process Flow
External_App -> Middleware: 1. Event triggers\n(new record, form submit) {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.stroke-width: 2
  style.animated: true
}

Middleware -> Middleware: 2. Map data fields\nto Tallyfy format {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

Middleware -> Tallyfy: 3. Launch process\nwith mapped data {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.stroke-width: 3
  style.animated: true
}

Tallyfy -> Tallyfy: 4. Create process\ninstance {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

Tallyfy -> Middleware: 5. Return process ID\nfor tracking {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.stroke-dash: 3
}

Middleware -> External_App: 6. Confirm launch\n(optional webhook) {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.stroke-dash: 3
}

# Process Instance
Process: Active Process {
  shape: circle
  style.fill: "#e1f7e6"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.stroke-width: 2
}

Tallyfy -> Process: Process running {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.stroke-width: 2
}
```

**What to notice:**
- Middleware watches for events and translates between systems (steps 2-4)
- Data mapping happens within the middleware before reaching Tallyfy
- Once configured, everything runs automatically

### What can middleware do with Tallyfy?

*   Launch Tallyfy processes from events in other tools (new CRM deal, calendar event, database update)
*   Pass external data straight into Tallyfy kick-off form fields
*   Transform data formats between systems when needed
*   Add conditional logic - only launch if certain criteria are met in the trigger app

### Connecting online forms

When someone submits a form, middleware grabs the answers and launches a Tallyfy process automatically. It's one of the most common use cases.

| Form Tool         | Connection Type | Data Sent         |
|-------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| Google Forms      | Built-in connector | All form answers  |
| Microsoft Forms   | Built-in connector | All form answers  |
| Typeform          | Webhook      | All form answers  |
| Wufoo             | Webhook      | All form answers  |
| Cognito Forms     | Webhook      | All form answers  |

### Choosing a middleware platform

*   **Make.com (Recommended)** - Flexible, great for complex data mapping.
*   **Microsoft Power Automate (Recommended)** - Best if you're already on Microsoft 365.
*   **Zapier** - Simple setup, wide app support.
*   **Pabbly** - Affordable, solid basics.
*   **Workato / Tray.io** - Enterprise-grade, for complex needs.

When deciding, think about: connection complexity, budget, which apps you already use, how much data transformation you need, and your team's technical comfort.

### Setting up middleware integration

1.  **Plan** - Decide which event/app should trigger which Tallyfy template launch.
2.  **Choose** - Pick your middleware tool.
3.  **Build** - Create the workflow: set a trigger, add a Tallyfy "Launch Process" action, map data fields.
4.  **Test** - Verify processes launch correctly with the right data.
5.  **Activate** - Turn on your workflow and monitor it.
