## How to launch processes using middleware

### What you need

- A Tallyfy account with permission to launch processes.
- An account with a [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) platform (like Make.com, Power Automate, Zapier).
- A Tallyfy [process template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) you want to launch automatically.
- Access to the other system (e.g., a CRM, a form tool, a database) that will trigger the launch.

### What is middleware integration?

[Middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) tools act as a bridge between Tallyfy and other software. They watch for something to happen in another application (the "trigger") and then automatically tell Tallyfy to launch a specific process, often sending data along too. This lets you start Tallyfy workflows based on events elsewhere, without needing custom code.

### How middleware launches Tallyfy processes

1.  **Connect**: You connect your middleware tool to both Tallyfy and the other application using your account details.
2.  **Trigger**: You set up a trigger in the middleware â€“ what event in the other application should start the workflow? (e.g., "New contact added in HubSpot", "Form submitted in Typeform").
3.  **Map Data**: You tell the middleware how to match data from the trigger application to the [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) in your Tallyfy template's kick-off form.
4.  **Launch Action**: You add an action in the middleware to "Launch Process" in Tallyfy, using the mapped data.
5.  **Run**: When the trigger event happens, the middleware automatically launches the Tallyfy process with the data filled in.

### What can middleware connect to Tallyfy?

Middleware makes it easy to:

*   Start Tallyfy processes when things happen in other tools (like a new CRM deal, a calendar event, a database update).
*   Automatically pass data from those tools into the Tallyfy process when it launches.
*   Fill in Tallyfy kick-off [forms](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) automatically.
*   Change data formats if needed between the systems.
*   Add logic (e.g., only launch the Tallyfy process IF a certain condition is met in the other tool).

### Example: Connecting Online Forms

Middleware is great for connecting online form tools (like Google Forms, Typeform, etc.) to Tallyfy. When someone submits the form, the middleware can grab the answers and use them to launch a Tallyfy process.

| Form Tool         | Connection Difficulty | Data Sent         |
|-------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| Google Forms      | Easy (Native Connector) | All form answers  |
| Microsoft Forms   | Easy (Native Connector) | All form answers  |
| Typeform          | Medium (Webhook)      | All form answers  |
| Wufoo             | Medium (Webhook)      | All form answers  |
| Cognito Forms     | Medium (Webhook)      | All form answers  |

### Choosing a Middleware Platform

*   **Make.com (Recommended)**: Very flexible, good for complex data mapping.
*   **Microsoft Power Automate (Recommended)**: Great if you use Microsoft 365.
*   **Zapier**: Simple for basic connections, very wide app support.
*   **Pabbly**: Often more affordable, good basic features.
*   **Workato / Tray.io**: More powerful, aimed at enterprise/complex needs.

Consider:
*   How complex is the connection you need?
*   What's your budget?
*   What other apps do you already use?
*   How much data manipulation is needed?
*   Your team's technical comfort level.

### General Steps to Set Up

1.  **Plan**: Decide which event in which app should trigger which Tallyfy template launch.
2.  **Choose**: Select your middleware platform.
3.  **Build**: Create the workflow in the middleware: set the trigger, add the Tallyfy "Launch Process" action, map the data fields.
4.  **Test**: Run tests to ensure processes launch correctly with the right data.
5.  **Activate**: Turn on your middleware workflow.
