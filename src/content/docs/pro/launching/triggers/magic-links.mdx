title: Launch via a magic link
---

## Prerequisites

Before implementing magic links, ensure you have:
- A Tallyfy account with access to the integrations settings
- Knowledge of the templates or tasks you want to manipulate via magic links
- Basic understanding of URL parameters and encoding
- Authentication credentials for Tallyfy

## Understanding magic links

Magic links are specialized URLs that perform predefined actions in Tallyfy. They enable automation through simple HTTP requests and can pass data parameters to trigger specific system behaviors without requiring manual intervention.

:::caution[Authentication requirement]
You must be signed into Tallyfy to use magic links. Unauthenticated users will be prompted to sign in first before the magic link action is performed.
:::

## Accessing magic links

To find magic link settings:
1. Navigate to **Settings** in your Tallyfy account
2. Select **Integrations** from the menu
3. Click on **Magic Links** section

## Magic link capabilities

Magic links can perform various actions in Tallyfy:

| Action Type | Description | Use Case |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Create one-off tasks | Generate standalone tasks | Quick to-dos without full processes |
| Launch processes | Start new process instances | Template execution from external systems |
| Complete tasks | Mark tasks as finished | Remote task completion |
| Reopen tasks | Change task status to active | Reactivate previously completed tasks |
| Add comments | Post text to task activity logs | Remote communication |
| Edit deadlines | Change task due dates | Schedule adjustments |
| Update form fields | Modify form field values | Data updates from external sources |

## Creating magic links

### For one-off tasks

1. Navigate to the Magic Links section
2. Click **Get a Magic Link**
3. Select **Create a One-Off Task** from the dropdown
4. Configure the basic parameters:
   - Task name (or use a parameter)
   - Default assignee
   - Due date (or use a parameter)
5. Copy the generated URL for implementation

### For process launches

1. Navigate to the Magic Links section
2. Click **Get a Magic Link**
3. Select **Launch a Process** from the dropdown
4. Choose a template from your library list
5. Configure process launch parameters:
   - Process naming convention
   - Default field values (if applicable)
6. Copy the generated URL
7. Customize parameters as needed

The system generates a link containing your organization ID and template ID that can be used to trigger process launches.

## Magic link structure

A typical process launch magic link with kickoff field data has this format:

```
https://go.tallyfy.com/[OrganizationID]/process/[TemplateID]/create?
default_run_name=Process+Name&
ko_fields=%5B%7B%22field-name%22:%22field-value%22%7D%5D&
launchprocess=true
```

:::note[URL encoding]
Parameter values in magic links must be properly URL-encoded to handle special characters. Most programming languages provide built-in functions for URL encoding.
:::

### Using auto-naming

For templates with auto-naming enabled, you can simplify magic links by using the "auto" keyword instead of a specific template ID:

```
https://go.tallyfy.com/[OrganizationID]/process/auto?
default_run_name=Process+Name&
ko_fields=%5B%7B%22field-name%22:%22field-value%22%7D%5D&
launchprocess=true
```

## Field value syntax reference

When passing form field values in magic links, use the following syntax for different field types:

|Field Type|Syntax Format|Example|
|------------------|------|-------|
|Short text box|`"text value"`|`"John Doe"`|
|Long text box|`"text content"`|`"This is a detailed description..."`|
|Dropdown|`{"id":ID,"text":"LABEL","value":null,"required":BOOLEAN}`|`{"id":1,"text":"High Priority","value":null,"required":true}`|
|Checkbox|`[{"id":ID,"text":"LABEL","value":null,"required":BOOLEAN,"selected":BOOLEAN}]`|`[{"id":1,"text":"Include shipping","value":null,"required":true,"selected":true}]`|
|Radio button|`"SELECTED_VALUE"`|`"Option A"`|
|Date/time|`"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.mmmZ"`|`"2023-05-01T00:00:00.000Z"`|

## Additional magic link action examples

Magic links support various Tallyfy actions with the following formats:

### 1. Create a one-off task
```
https://go.tallyfy.com/[OrganizationID]/magic?action=createOotTask&default_task_name=Review+Documents
```

### 2. Complete a task
```
https://go.tallyfy.com/[OrganizationID]/magic?action=completeTask&task_id=[TaskID]
```

### 3. Reopen a task
```
https://go.tallyfy.com/[OrganizationID]/magic?action=reOpenTask&task_id=[TaskID]
```

### 4. Write a comment
```
https://go.tallyfy.com/[OrganizationID]/magic?action=writeAComment&task_id=[TaskID]&comment=Please+review+this+task
```

### 5. Edit task deadline
```
https://go.tallyfy.com/[OrganizationID]/magic?action=editDeadline&task_id=[TaskID]&deadline=2023-05-15+15:30:00
```

### 6. Update form field
```
https://go.tallyfy.com/[OrganizationID]/magic?action=updateFormFieldValue&task_id=[TaskID]&form_fields={"field_id":"new_value"}
```

## Implementation examples

Magic links can be used in various scenarios to improve workflow automation:

1. **Email button integration** - Embed magic links in email buttons to allow one-click task completion
2. **QR code generation** - Create QR codes with magic links for mobile scanning and process initiation
3. **Internal dashboard integration** - Add magic link buttons to intranet pages for common workflows
4. **CRM system integration** - Generate magic links from customer records to launch related processes

These implementations enable integration between Tallyfy and other systems, allowing one-click actions and data transfers without manual intervention.
