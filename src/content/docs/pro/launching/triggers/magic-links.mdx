## Understanding and creating magic links

### What you need

*   Access to Tallyfy **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Magic Links** (usually Admin only).
*   The ID of the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) or [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) you want the link to affect.
*   A basic understanding of web links (URLs) and parameters.
*   Users clicking the link must already be logged into Tallyfy.

### What are magic links?

Magic links are special web links (URLs) that make Tallyfy automatically do something when a logged-in user clicks them. You can create links to:

*   Create a one-off task.
*   Launch a process from a template (and pre-fill info).
*   Complete a specific task.
*   Re-open a specific task.
*   Add a comment to a task.
*   Change a task's deadline.
*   Update a form field value in a specific task.

They are useful for triggering Tallyfy actions from emails, websites, or other tools.

:::caution[For internal users only]
Magic links only work for users logged in to your Tallyfy organization. They **don't** work for external guests. To let external users start processes, use [public kick-off forms](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/).
:::

### Finding the magic link generator

1. Go to **Settings** > **Integrations**.
2. Click the **Magic Links** section.

### What magic links can do

| Action                      | Description                                      |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Create One-Off Task         | Creates a standalone task.                       |
| Launch Process              | Starts a new process from a template.            |
| Complete Task               | Completes a specific task.                       |
| Re-open Task                | Re-opens a completed task.                       |
| Add Comment                 | Adds a set comment to a specific task.         |
| Edit Deadline               | Updates the due date of a specific task.       |
| Update Form Field           | Updates a form field value in a specific task. |

### Creating magic links

#### Example: Link to launch a process

1. Go to the Magic Links section in Settings.
2. Click **Get a Magic Link**.
3. Choose **Launch a Process** from the dropdown.
4. Select the **Template** you want the link to launch.
5. Set options like the default **Process Name** (you can use variables).
6. You can also pre-fill data in [kick-off fields](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/) by adding parameters (see structure below).
7. Copy the generated magic link URL.
8. You might need to add more parameters manually (e.g., adding field values).

#### Example: Link to create a one-off task

1. Go to the Magic Links section.
2. Click **Get a Magic Link**.
3. Choose **Create a One-Off Task**.
4. Set the default task details (name, assignee, deadline - some can be overridden in the URL).
5. Copy the generated URL.

### Magic link structure (example for launching)

A link to launch a process and fill in data might look like:

```text
https://go.tallyfy.com/[YourOrgID]/process/[TemplateID]/create?default_run_name=Your+Process+Name&ko_fields=[{"fieldName1":"Value1"},{"fieldName2":"Value2"}]&launchprocess=true
```

*   Replace `[YourOrgID]` and `[TemplateID]` with your actual IDs.
*   `default_run_name` sets the process name.
*   `ko_fields` contains the kick-off field names and values to pre-fill.
*   **Important**: Values must be [URL encoded](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.ASP) (e.g., spaces become `+` or `%20`).
*   **Important**: The `ko_fields` value needs JSON formatting `[{"field-name":"field-value"}]`, which must also be URL-encoded.

#### Using "auto" naming

If your template uses [kick-off fields for auto-naming](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/#naming-the-triggered-process), you can use `auto` instead of the Template ID:

```text
https://go.tallyfy.com/[YourOrgID]/process/auto?ko_fields=[{"fieldName1":"Value1"}]&launchprocess=true
```

:::note[Auto-naming rules]
- Only works if fields used for auto-naming are *required* kick-off fields.
- The auto-generated name must be 550 characters or less.
:::

### Field value syntax (for ko_fields parameter)

When defining values for the `ko_fields` parameter, use this format (before you URL-encode it):

| Field Type        | Example JSON Value String                                                              |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Short/Long Text   | `"Your Text Value"`                                                                    |
| Dropdown          | `{"id":ID,"text":"Selected Label","value":null,"required":true}` (Get ID/Label from template editor) |
| Checkbox          | `[{"id":ID,"text":"Checked Label","value":null,"required":false,"selected":true}]` (List of checked labels/IDs) |
| Radio Button      | `"Selected Radio Value"`                                                               |
| Date/Time         | `"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.mmmZ"` (`UTC` format)                                            |

### Other magic link action examples

(Replace placeholders like `[YourOrgID]`, `[TaskID]`, values, etc.)

*   **Create Task:** `...?action=createOotTask&default_task_name=Review+Doc`
*   **Complete Task:** `...?action=completeTask&task_id=[TaskID]`
*   **Re-open Task:** `...?action=reOpenTask&task_id=[TaskID]`
*   **Add Comment:** `...?action=writeAComment&task_id=[TaskID]&comment=Please+review`
*   **Edit Deadline:** `...?action=editDeadline&task_id=[TaskID]&deadline=2024-12-31+17:00:00`
*   **Update Form Field:** `...?action=updateFormFieldValue&task_id=[TaskID]&form_fields={"fieldId123":"New+Value"}`

### Where to use magic links

- Buttons or links in emails (e.g., "Click here to approve task").
- Links on your company intranet.
- Buttons or links generated by other tools (like your CRM).
- QR codes.
