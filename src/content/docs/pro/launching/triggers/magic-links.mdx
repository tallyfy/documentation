title: Launch via a magic link
---

Magic links are URLs that trigger Tallyfy actions automatically when a logged-in user clicks them. You can create links to:

- Launch a process from a template (and pre-fill kick-off data)
- Create a one-off task
- Complete or re-open a specific task
- Add a comment to a task
- Change a task's deadline
- Update a form field value on a task

:::caution[For internal users only]
Magic links only work for users logged in to your Tallyfy organization. They don't work for external guests. To let external people start processes, use [public kick-off forms](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/).
:::

:::warning[Required kick-off fields]
Magic links can't bypass required kick-off form fields. If your template has required fields, the magic link will fail because it tries to start the process without showing the form. Workarounds:
- Make kick-off fields optional if appropriate
- Use API calls that can supply all required field data
- Use [public kick-off forms](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/) for manual entry
- Use middleware platforms that programmatically supply required values
:::

### Access the magic link generator

1. Go to **Settings** > **Integrations**.
2. Find the **Magic Links** card and click **Get a Magic Link**.

### Available actions

| Action | What it does |
|--------|-------------|
| Create one-off task | Creates a standalone task |
| Launch a process | Starts a new process from a template |
| Complete a task | Completes a specific task |
| Reopen a task | Re-opens a completed task |
| Write comment to a task | Adds a comment to a specific task |
| Edit task deadline | Updates the due date of a task |
| Update form field value | Changes a form field value on a task |

### Create a magic link to launch a process

1. Click **Get a Magic Link** in the Magic Links card.
2. Choose **Launch a process**.
3. Select the template you want the link to launch.
4. Set the default process name (you can use variables).
5. Copy the generated URL.
6. Optionally add more parameters manually to pre-fill [kick-off fields](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/).

### Create a magic link for one-off tasks

1. Click **Get a Magic Link**.
2. Choose **Create a one-off task**.
3. Set the default task name.
4. Copy the generated URL.

### Magic link URL structure

A link to launch a process and pre-fill data follows this pattern:

```text
https://go.tallyfy.com/[YourOrgID]/process/[TemplateID]/create?default_run_name=Your+Process+Name&ko_fields=[{"fieldName1":"Value1"},{"fieldName2":"Value2"}]&launchprocess=true
```

- Replace `[YourOrgID]` and `[TemplateID]` with your actual IDs.
- `default_run_name` sets the process name (max 550 characters).
- `ko_fields` contains kick-off field names and values to pre-fill as JSON.
- All values must be [URL encoded](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.ASP) (spaces become `+` or `%20`).
- The `ko_fields` JSON - `[{"field-name":"field-value"}]` - must also be URL-encoded.

:::note[Auto-naming]
If your template has auto-naming enabled, Tallyfy generates the process name from kick-off field values using the `default_process_name_format` set on the template. The auto-generated name can't exceed 550 characters. All required kick-off fields must still be provided in `ko_fields`, or the launch will fail.
:::

### Field value syntax

Use this format for `ko_fields` values (before URL-encoding):

| Field type | Example JSON value |
|------------|-------------------|
| Short/Long text | `"Your Text Value"` |
| Dropdown | `{"id":ID,"text":"Selected Label","value":null,"required":true}` (get ID from template editor) |
| Checkbox | `[{"id":ID,"text":"Checked Label","value":null,"required":false,"selected":true}]` |
| Radio button | `"Selected Radio Value"` |
| Date/Time | `"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ"` (UTC format) |

### Other action examples

Replace `[YourOrgID]` and `[TaskID]` with your actual values. All task-based actions use the `/:org_id/magic` URL path.

- **Create task:** `...?action=createOotTask&default_task_name=Review+Doc`
- **Complete task:** `...?action=completeTask&task_id=[TaskID]`
- **Re-open task:** `...?action=reOpenTask&task_id=[TaskID]`
- **Add comment:** `...?action=writeAComment&task_id=[TaskID]&comment=Please+review`
- **Edit deadline:** `...?action=editDeadline&task_id=[TaskID]&deadline=YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.SSSZ`
- **Update form field:** `...?action=updateFormFieldValue&task_id=[TaskID]&form_fields={"fieldId123":"New+Value"}`

### Where to use magic links

- Buttons or links in emails (e.g., "Click here to approve")
- Links on your company intranet
- Buttons generated by other tools like your CRM
- QR codes for mobile-friendly workflow triggers
