## Understanding and creating magic links

## Requirements

Before implementing magic links, ensure you have:
- A Tallyfy account with access to the [integrations](/products/pro/integrations/) settings
- Knowledge of the [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) or [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) you want to manipulate via magic links
- Basic understanding of URL parameters and encoding
- Authentication credentials for Tallyfy

## Understanding magic links

Magic links are specialized URLs that perform predefined actions in Tallyfy. They enable automation through simple HTTP requests and can pass data parameters to trigger specific system behaviors without requiring manual intervention.

:::caution[Authentication requirement]
You must be signed into Tallyfy to use magic links. Unauthenticated users will be prompted to sign in first before the magic link action is performed.
:::

:::caution[External users and clients]
Magic links are not suitable for external clients or users who are not [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) of your Tallyfy organization. For collecting information from external parties or allowing them to initiate [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), use [public kick-off forms](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/) instead.
:::

## Accessing magic links

To find magic link settings:
1. Navigate to **Settings** in your Tallyfy account
2. Select **Integrations** from the menu
3. Click on **Magic Links** section

## Magic link capabilities

Magic links can perform various actions in Tallyfy:

| Action Type | Description | Use Case |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Create one-off [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) | Generate standalone tasks | Quick to-dos without full [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) |
| Launch [processes](/products/pro/launching/) | Start new process instances | Template execution from external systems |
| Complete [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) | Mark tasks as finished | Remote task completion |
| Reopen tasks | Change task status to active | Reactivate previously completed tasks |
| Add comments | Post text to task activity logs | Remote communication |
| Edit deadlines | Change task due dates | Schedule adjustments |
| Update [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) | Modify form field values | Data updates from external sources |

## Creating magic links

### For one-off tasks

1. Navigate to the Magic Links section
2. Click **Get a Magic Link**
3. Select **Create a One-Off [Task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/)** from the dropdown
4. Configure the basic parameters:
   - Task name (or use a parameter)
   - Default assignee
   - Due date (or use a parameter)
5. Copy the generated URL for implementation

### For process launches

1. Navigate to the Magic Links section
2. Click **Get a Magic Link**
3. Select **Launch a [Process](/products/pro/launching/)** from the dropdown
4. Choose a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) from your library list
5. Configure process launch parameters:
   - Process naming convention
   - Default field values (if applicable)
6. Copy the generated URL
7. Customize parameters as needed

The system generates a link containing your organization ID and template ID that can be used to trigger process launches.

## Magic link structure

A typical process launch magic link with kickoff field data has this format:

```
https://go.tallyfy.com/[OrganizationID]/process/[TemplateID]/create?
default_run_name=Process+Name&
ko_fields=%5B%7B%22field-name%22:%22field-value%22%7D%5D&
launchprocess=true
```

:::note[URL encoding]
Parameter values in magic links must be properly URL-encoded to handle special characters. Most programming languages provide built-in functions for URL encoding.
:::

### Using auto-naming

For [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) with auto-naming enabled, you can simplify magic links by using the "auto" keyword instead of a specific template ID:

```
https://go.tallyfy.com/[OrganizationID]/process/auto?
default_run_name=Process+Name&
ko_fields=%5B%7B%22field-name%22:%22field-value%22%7D%5D&
launchprocess=true
```

:::note[Auto-naming limitations]
The auto-naming feature only works with required [kick-off form fields](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/) in your template. This ensures that the fields used for naming will always contain values, as they are mandatory when [launching the process](/products/pro/launching/). Optional fields cannot be used in auto-naming.

The auto-naming feature has a maximum limit of 550 characters. When setting up auto-naming in your template settings, ensure that your naming pattern (including [field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) variables) doesn't exceed this limit.
:::

## Field value syntax reference

When passing [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) values in magic links, use the following syntax for different field types:

|Field Type|Syntax Format|Example|
|------------------|------|-------|
|Short text box|`"text value"`|`"John Doe"`|
|Long text box|`"text content"`|`"This is a detailed description..."`|
|Dropdown|`{"id":ID,"text":"LABEL","value":null,"required":BOOLEAN}`|`{"id":1,"text":"High Priority","value":null,"required":true}`|
|Checkbox|`[{"id":ID,"text":"LABEL","value":null,"required":BOOLEAN,"selected":BOOLEAN}]`|`[{"id":1,"text":"Include shipping","value":null,"required":true,"selected":true}]`|
|Radio button|`"SELECTED_VALUE"`|`"Option A"`|
|Date/time|`"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.mmmZ"`|`"2023-05-01T00:00:00.000Z"`|

## Additional magic link action examples

Magic links support various Tallyfy actions with the following formats:

### 1. Create a one-off task
```
https://go.tallyfy.com/[OrganizationID]/magic?action=createOotTask&default_task_name=Review+Documents
```

### 2. Complete a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/)
```
https://go.tallyfy.com/[OrganizationID]/magic?action=completeTask&task_id=[TaskID]
```

### 3. Reopen a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/)
```
https://go.tallyfy.com/[OrganizationID]/magic?action=reOpenTask&task_id=[TaskID]
```

### 4. Write a comment
```
https://go.tallyfy.com/[OrganizationID]/magic?action=writeAComment&task_id=[TaskID]&comment=Please+review+this+task
```

### 5. Edit [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) deadline
```
https://go.tallyfy.com/[OrganizationID]/magic?action=editDeadline&task_id=[TaskID]&deadline=2023-05-15+15:30:00
```

### 6. Update [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/)
```
https://go.tallyfy.com/[OrganizationID]/magic?action=updateFormFieldValue&task_id=[TaskID]&form_fields={"field_id":"new_value"}
```

## Implementation examples

Magic links can be used in various scenarios to improve workflow automation:

1. **Email button integration** - Embed magic links in email buttons to allow one-click [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) completion
2. **QR code generation** - Create QR codes with magic links for mobile scanning and [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) initiation
3. **Internal dashboard integration** - Add magic link buttons to intranet pages for common workflows
4. **CRM system integration** - Generate magic links from customer records to launch related [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)

These implementations enable integration between Tallyfy and other systems, allowing one-click actions and data transfers without manual intervention.
