## What is a magic link?

Magic links in Tallyfy are pre-made links that perform actions and can pass data through to Tallyfy via the link. You can manipulate the link itself to pass through data, change values and perform actions.

:::caution[Warning]

Important - to use a magic link - you must be signed in to Tallyfy. If you're not signed in - you will be prompted to sign in.

With magic links, you can easily create a one-off task or launch a process with just one click. To see magic links - go to Settings > Integrations > Magic Links.

To create a magic link for a one-off task, click on "Get a Magic Link" and select "Create a One-Off Task". You can customize the URL to assign a unique name to the task.

To create a magic link to launch a process, click on "Get a Magic Link" and select "Launch a Process". You will need to select a template from your library. The system will generate a unique link with the organization ID and template ID. You can assign a process name and provide values for required kick-off fields in the URL.

Here's an example of a magic link with a kick-off field:

```
https://go.tallyfy.com/49b796c6b1e422181141ab801bfeb8bd/process/ab5c83b3d433798b571f29d1cfeec87f/create?default_run_name=Apr%2029,%2007:57am%20-%20Employee%20onboarding&amp;ko_fields=%255B%257B%2522employee-name-223217%2522:"Ruku Kadu"%257d%255d&amp;launchprocess=true
```

You can also use the "auto-naming" feature to simplify the magic link syntax so that there's one less thing to pass through and worry about. With auto-naming and pre-filled kick-off form fields, the magic link would look like this:

```
https://go.tallyfy.com/49b796c6b1e422181141ab801bfeb8bd/process/auto?default_run_name=Apr%2029,%2007:57am%20-%20Employee%20onboarding&amp;ko_fields=%255B%257B%2522employee-name-223217%2522:"Ruku Kadu"%257d%255d&amp;launchprocess=true
```

You can enter values for different form fields using the syntax provided in the table below:

|Type|Syntax|
|------------------|------|
|Short text box: (string)|`"short text box value"`|
|Long text box: (string)|`"long text box value"`|
|Dropdown: (object)|`{"id":1,"text":"1","value":null,"required":true}`|
|Checkbox: (array of objects)|`[{"id":1,"text":"1","value":null,"required":true,"selected":true}]`|
|Radio: (string/text)|`"1"`|
|Datetime: (string)|`"2021-04-29T00:00:00.000Z"`|
|File: (array of objects)|`[{"id":"21b98bc82016581f1d32105502071083","url":"organizations/54339011418f12485ca7c5ba821cd585/file/21b98bc82016581f1d32105502071083/dl","source":"local","system":null,"step_id":null,"subject":{"id":"6b7d31b688f4bd738349767d40dff643","type":"Checklist"},"version":1,"filename":"social__5___1___4__jpg.jpg","uploaded_from":"ko_field"},{"url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a3/June_odd-eyed-cat.jpg","source":"url","subject":{"id":"6b7d31b688f4bd738349767d40dff643","type":"Checklist"},"filename":"upload.wikimedia.org","uploaded_from":"ko_field"}]`|

Besides creating tasks and launching processes, you can perform other actions using magic links. Here are some examples:

1. Create a one-off task: `https://go.tallyfy.com/<YOUR-ORG-ID>/magic?action=createOotTask&default_task_name=Type in your task title`
2. Complete a task: `https://go.tallyfy.com/<YOUR-ORG-ID>/magic?action=completeTask&task_id=b0d9153016723b3f6f54f152db430f09`
3. Reopen a task: `https://go.tallyfy.com/<YOUR-ORG-ID>/magic?action=reOpenTask&task_id=b0d9153016723b3f6f54f152db430f09`
4. Write a comment to a task: `https://go.tallyfy.com/<YOUR-ORG-ID>/magic?action=writeAComment&task_id=b0d9153016723b3f6f54f152db430f09?comment=Default comment`
5. Edit task deadline: `https://go.tallyfy.com/<YOUR-ORG-ID>/magic?action=editDeadline&task_id=b0d9153016723b3f6f54f152db430f09?deadline=2022-01-20 03:11:02`
6. Update form field: `https://go.tallyfy.com/<YOUR-ORG-ID>/magic?action=updateFormFieldValue&task_id=b0d9153016723b3f6f54f152db430f09?form_fields={"d6410030b7fe633403688e900c5a6ba3":null}`
