## Understanding and Creating Magic Links

### What you need

- Access to Tallyfy **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Magic Links**.
- To know which [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) or [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) you want the link to affect.
- Basic understanding of how web links (URLs) work, including parameters.
- Users clicking the link must be logged into Tallyfy.

### What are Magic Links?

Magic links are special web links (URLs) that make Tallyfy automatically perform an action when a logged-in user clicks them. You can create links to:

*   Create a one-off task.
*   Launch a process from a template (and pre-fill some info).
*   Complete a specific task.
*   Re-open a specific task.
*   Add a comment to a task.
*   Change a task's deadline.
*   Update the value of a form field in a task.

They are useful for triggering Tallyfy actions from other places, like buttons in emails, links on an internal website, or from other software.

:::caution[For Internal Users Only]
Magic links require the user clicking them to be logged into your Tallyfy organization. They **cannot** be used by external clients or guests. For external users to start processes or submit info, use [public kick-off forms](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/).
:::

### Finding the Magic Link Generator

1. Go to **Settings** > **Integrations**.
2. Click on the **Magic Links** section.

### What Magic Links Can Do

| Action                      | Description                                        |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Create One-Off Task         | Creates a single task not part of a process.       |
| Launch Process              | Starts a new process run from a template.          |
| Complete Task               | Marks a specific task as done.                     |
| Re-open Task                | Changes a completed task's status back to open.    |
| Add Comment                 | Adds a predefined comment to a specific task.      |
| Edit Deadline               | Changes the due date of a specific task.         |
| Update Form Field           | Changes the value of a field in a specific task. |

### Creating Magic Links

#### Example: Link to Launch a Process

1. Go to the Magic Links section in Settings.
2. Click **Get a Magic Link**.
3. Choose **Launch a Process** from the dropdown.
4. Select the **Template** you want the link to launch.
5. Configure options like the default **Process Name** (you can use variables).
6. You can also pre-fill **kick-off form fields** by adding parameters (see structure below).
7. Copy the generated magic link URL.
8. You might need to customize the parameters further (e.g., adding field values).

#### Example: Link to Create a One-Off Task

1. Go to the Magic Links section.
2. Click **Get a Magic Link**.
3. Choose **Create a One-Off Task**.
4. Set the default task name, assignee, and due date (some can be passed in the URL later).
5. Copy the generated URL.

### Magic Link Structure (Example for Launching)

A link to launch a process and fill in kick-off fields looks like this:

```
https://go.tallyfy.com/[YourOrgID]/process/[TemplateID]/create?default_run_name=Your+Process+Name&ko_fields=[{"fieldName1":"Value1"},{"fieldName2":"Value2"}]&launchprocess=true
```

*   Replace `[YourOrgID]` and `[TemplateID]`.
*   `default_run_name` sets the process name.
*   `ko_fields` contains the kick-off field names and values you want to pre-fill.
*   **Important**: Values need to be [URL encoded](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.ASP) (e.g., spaces become `+` or `%20`).
*   The `ko_fields` part needs specific JSON formatting `[{"field-name":"field-value"}]` which also needs URL encoding.

#### Using "Auto" Naming

If your template uses [kick-off fields to automatically name the process](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/#naming-the-triggered-process), you can use `auto` instead of the `[TemplateID]` in the URL:

```
https://go.tallyfy.com/[YourOrgID]/process/auto?ko_fields=[{"fieldName1":"Value1"}]&launchprocess=true
```

:::note[Auto-Naming Rules]
- Only works if the fields used for auto-naming are *required* kick-off fields.
- The total length of the auto-generated name cannot exceed 550 characters.
:::

### Field Value Syntax (for ko_fields parameter)

When adding field values to the `ko_fields` part of the URL, use this format (before URL encoding):

| Field Type        | Example JSON Value String                                                    |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Short/Long Text   | `"Your Text Value"`                                                          |
| Dropdown          | `{"id":ID,"text":"Selected Label","value":null,"required":true}` (Get ID/Label from template setup) |
| Checkbox          | `[{"id":ID,"text":"Checked Label","value":null,"required":false,"selected":true}]` (List of checked items) |
| Radio Button      | `"Selected Radio Value"`                                                     |
| Date/Time         | `"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.mmmZ"` (UTC format)                                  |

### Other Magic Link Action Examples

(Replace `[YourOrgID]`, `[TaskID]`, values, etc. as needed)

*   **Create Task:** `...?action=createOotTask&default_task_name=Review+Doc`
*   **Complete Task:** `...?action=completeTask&task_id=12345`
*   **Re-open Task:** `...?action=reOpenTask&task_id=12345`
*   **Add Comment:** `...?action=writeAComment&task_id=12345&comment=Please+review`
*   **Edit Deadline:** `...?action=editDeadline&task_id=12345&deadline=2024-12-31+17:00:00`
*   **Update Form Field:** `...?action=updateFormFieldValue&task_id=12345&form_fields={"fieldId123":"New+Value"}`

### Where to use Magic Links

- Buttons in emails (e.g., "Click here to approve task").
- Links on your company intranet.
- Buttons or links generated by other software (like your CRM).
- QR codes for mobile users.
