## Magic links in Tallyfy

### Prerequisites

*   Access to Tallyfy Settings > Integrations > Magic Links (usually Admin only)
*   The ID of the template or task you want the link to affect
*   A basic understanding of web links (URLs) and parameters
*   Users clicking the link must already be logged into Tallyfy

### What are magic links?

Magic links are special web links (URLs) that make Tallyfy automatically perform actions when a logged-in user clicks them. You can create links to:

*   Create a one-off task
*   Launch a process from a template (and pre-fill info)
*   Complete a specific task
*   Re-open a specific task
*   Add a comment to a task
*   Change a task's deadline
*   Update a form field value in a specific task

They're useful for triggering Tallyfy actions from emails, websites, or other tools.

:::caution[For internal users only]
Magic links only work for users logged in to your Tallyfy organization. They **don't** work for external guests. To let external users start processes, use [public kick-off forms](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/).
:::

:::warning[Magic Links and required kick-off fields]
Magic links cannot bypass required kick-off form fields. If your template has a kick-off form with required fields, the magic link will fail to launch the process because it attempts to start the process directly without displaying the form interface. For processes with required kick-off fields, consider:
- Making kick-off fields optional if appropriate
- Using API calls that can provide all required field data
- Using public kick-off forms for manual data entry
- Using middleware platforms that can programmatically supply required values
:::

### Access the magic link generator

1. Go to **Settings** > **Integrations**.
2. Click the **Magic Links** section.

### Create magic links

#### Launch a process

1. Go to the Magic Links section in Settings.
2. Click **Get a Magic Link**.
3. Choose **Launch a Process** from the dropdown.
4. Select the **Template** you want the link to launch.
5. Set options like the default **Process Name** (you can use variables).
6. You can also pre-fill data in [kick-off fields](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/) by adding parameters (see structure below).
7. Copy the generated magic link URL.
8. You might need to add more parameters manually (e.g., adding field values).

#### Create one-off tasks

1. Go to the Magic Links section.
2. Click **Get a Magic Link**.
3. Choose **Create a One-Off Task**.
4. Set the default task details (name, assignee, deadline - some can be overridden in the URL).
5. Copy the generated URL.

### Magic link structure for process launching

A link to launch a process and fill in data follows this structure:

```text
https://go.tallyfy.com/[YourOrgID]/process/[TemplateID]/create?default_run_name=Your+Process+Name&ko_fields=[{"fieldName1":"Value1"},{"fieldName2":"Value2"}]&launchprocess=true
```

*   Replace `[YourOrgID]` and `[TemplateID]` with your actual IDs.
*   `default_run_name` sets the process name.
*   `ko_fields` contains the kick-off field names and values to pre-fill.
*   **Important**: Values must be [URL encoded](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.ASP) (e.g., spaces become `+` or `%20`).
*   **Important**: The `ko_fields` value needs JSON formatting `[{"field-name":"field-value"}]`, which must also be URL-encoded.

#### Automatic naming

If your template uses kick-off fields for auto-naming, you can use `auto` instead of the Template ID for dynamic naming:

```text
https://go.tallyfy.com/[YourOrgID]/process/auto?ko_fields=[{"fieldName1":"Value1"}]&launchprocess=true
```

:::note[Auto-naming rules]
- Only works if fields used for auto-naming are *required* kick-off fields.
- The auto-generated name must be 550 characters or less.
- When using magic links with auto-naming, all required fields must be provided in the `ko_fields` parameter, otherwise the process launch will fail.
:::

### Field value syntax

When defining values for the `ko_fields` parameter, use this format (before you URL-encode it):

| Field Type        | Example JSON Value String                                                              |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Short/Long Text   | `"Your Text Value"`                                                                    |
| Dropdown          | `{"id":ID,"text":"Selected Label","value":null,"required":true}` (Get ID/Label from template editor) |
| Checkbox          | `[{"id":ID,"text":"Checked Label","value":null,"required":false,"selected":true}]` (List of checked labels/IDs) |
| Radio Button      | `"Selected Radio Value"`                                                               |
| Date/Time         | `"YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.mmmZ"` (`UTC` format)                                            |

### Examples of other actions

(Replace placeholders like `[YourOrgID]`, `[TaskID]`, values, etc. with your actual values)

*   **Create Task:** `...?action=createOotTask&default_task_name=Review+Doc`
*   **Complete Task:** `...?action=completeTask&task_id=[TaskID]`
*   **Re-open Task:** `...?action=reOpenTask&task_id=[TaskID]`
*   **Add Comment:** `...?action=writeAComment&task_id=[TaskID]&comment=Please+review`
*   **Edit Deadline:** `...?action=editDeadline&task_id=[TaskID]&deadline=2024-12-31+17:00:00`
*   **Update Form Field:** `...?action=updateFormFieldValue&task_id=[TaskID]&form_fields={"fieldId123":"New+Value"}`

### Where to use magic links

- Buttons or links in emails (e.g., "Click here to approve task")
- Links on your company intranet
- Buttons or links generated by other tools (like your CRM)
- QR codes for mobile-friendly workflow initiation
