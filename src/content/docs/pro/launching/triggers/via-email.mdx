## Automatically launch a process via email

:::note[Required kick-off form fields]

This is an example of a trigger that won't work if you have a **Required** kick-off form field configured in your template, if you try to send an email to the address, you'll receive an email notifying you that the process failed.

:::

You can launch a process automatically by sending an email to a specific email address.

- To find this address. Go to the edit view of the template you want to add a trigger and select **Other options** in the triggers section.

- Then, select the **Via inbound email** option. You should be able to see the email address you have to mail in order to launch your process!

- You can also capture the email body and attachments into a kick-off form field - illustrated on the trigger itself. If the two specially named kick-off fields do not exist - you will be invited to create them with a link named "CREATE IT NOW"

## More details on launching via email

Tallyfy makes launching a process via email super simple. Just send an email to a specific address, and the process will start automatically!

The email address format is:

```
bot+[TemplateID]-launch@tallyfy.com
```

To find the TemplateID, check the URL when editing your template:

There's a number of important things to keep in mind:

1. If the organization ID doesn't exist, we'll send you a failure message.
2. If the template ID doesn't exist, we'll also send you a failure message.
3. Make sure the FROM address matches the email address of a member in the organization. We do this for security reasons - non-members can't launch processes.
4. If the template requires kick-off form fields, you'll need to fill them out manually. We'll send you a failure message if you don't.
5. The subject line of your email will become the name of the process.

You can even include the email body and attachments as kick-off form fields.

## Adding a comment to a task via an email response

When it comes to replying to a task via email, simply add your comment to the body of the email.

Tallyfy will automatically add it as a comment to the task.

The format of the FROM address should be this:

```
bot+TASKID-comment-task@tallyfy.com
```

The _body_ of the email is used as the body of your comment, not the subject line.
