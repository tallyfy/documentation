### What you need

*   Permission to edit Tallyfy [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).
*   The template you want to launch via email should have **no** *required* [kick-off form fields](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/). Optional fields are fine.
*   The email address you send *from* must belong to an active [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) in your Tallyfy organization.

### Launching processes by sending an email

Tallyfy lets you start a specific [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) by sending an email to a special address. This is useful for starting workflows without logging into Tallyfy, especially for users on the go.

:::warning[Cannot use with required kick-off fields]
This email trigger method **doesn't work** if the template has any kick-off form fields marked as **Required**. You'll get an email saying the launch failed. Only use templates with optional (or no) kick-off fields if you want to launch them via email.
:::

### Setting up the email trigger for a template

Each template gets its own unique email address for launching.

<Steps>
1. Go to the **Templates** library.
2. Open the template you want to enable email launch for (in **Edit** mode).
3. Click **Triggers** in the left sidebar.
4. Choose **Other options**.
   ![Select Other options in Triggers menu](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-select-other-options-triggers.png)
5. Find the **Via inbound email** option.
6. Tallyfy shows the special email address created just for launching *this template*. Copy this address.
7. Share this address with team members who need to launch this process via email.
</Steps>

### How it works when an email is sent

When someone sends an email to that special address:

1. Tallyfy checks if the sender's email belongs to an active [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) in your organization.
2. If yes, Tallyfy starts a new [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) from the template linked to that address.
3. The email's **Subject** becomes the **Name** of the new process instance.
4. If you added special kick-off fields (see below), the email content copies into them.
5. Assignees for the first task(s) are notified.

### Automatically capture email content

You can have Tallyfy automatically save the email body and attachments into kick-off form fields. To do this, add [kick-off fields](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/) to your template with these specific internal names:

| Field Name              | What it Captures                  | Recommended Field Type |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------|
| `email_body`            | The full text of the email body   | Long Text Area         |
| `email_attachments`     | Any files attached to the email | File Upload            |

If you don't have these fields, Tallyfy might show a link to create them when you enable the email trigger.

### Email address format

The trigger email address format is:

```text
bot+[TemplateID]-launch@tallyfy.com
```

(Where `[TemplateID]` is the unique ID of your template).

### Example uses

*   **Field Updates**: Technicians email status updates after site visits (Subject: Site Visit - Client X; Body: Details; Attachments: Photos).
*   **Forwarding Requests**: Support forwards an email to the trigger address to start a complaint process.

### Important security notes

*   The sender **must** be an active Tallyfy member in your organization.
*   Use clear email subjects (they become the process name).
*   Each template has a unique trigger email.
*   Remember: **Cannot** launch templates with required kick-off fields via email.

### Adding comments by replying to task emails

Separately, you can also add comments to existing tasks by simply replying to the Tallyfy task notification email.

<Steps>
1. Get a task notification email from Tallyfy.
2. Reply to that email.
3. Your reply becomes a comment on the task.
4. Files attached to the reply are added to the comment.
</Steps>

(The reply-to address for comments looks like `bot+[TaskID]-comment-task@tallyfy.com`)

### Tips for using email triggers

- Keep a list of trigger emails for your team.
- Suggest standard subject formats for easier tracking.
- Remind users to put details in the body if you're capturing it.
- Test the trigger from different email clients your team uses.
