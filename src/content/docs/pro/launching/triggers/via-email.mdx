snippet: Tallyfy enables automatic process initiation through designated email addresses
  allowing users to start workflows by sending emails without logging into the platform
  while capturing email content and attachments in kickoff fields.
title: Launch via inbound email
---

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

### What you need

- Permission to edit Tallyfy [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).
- The template you want to launch via email should **not** have any *required* [kick-off form fields](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/). Optional fields are okay.
- The email address you will send *from* must belong to an active [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) in your Tallyfy organization.

### Launching Processes by Sending an Email

Tallyfy lets you start a specific [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) just by sending an email to a special address. This is useful for starting workflows quickly without needing to log into Tallyfy, especially for team members on the go.

:::warning[Cannot Use with Required Kick-off Fields]
This email trigger method **does not work** if the template has any kick-off form fields marked as **Required**. You will get an email back saying the launch failed. Use templates with only optional kick-off fields (or none) if you want to launch them via email.
:::

### Setting up the Email Trigger for a Template

Each template gets its own unique email address for launching.

<Steps>
1. Go to the **Templates** library.
2. Open the template you want to enable email launch for in **Edit** mode.
3. Click **Triggers** in the left sidebar.
4. Choose **Other options**.
   ![Select Other options in Triggers menu](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-select-other-options-triggers.png)
5. Find the **Via inbound email** option.
6. Tallyfy shows you the special email address created just for launching *this specific template*. Copy this address.
7. Share this email address with the team members who need to launch this process via email.
</Steps>

### How it works when an email is sent

When someone sends an email to that special address:

1. Tallyfy checks if the sender's email address belongs to an active [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) in your organization.
2. If yes, Tallyfy starts a new [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) using the template linked to that email address.
3. The **Subject** of the email becomes the **Name** of the new process run.
4. If you set up special kick-off fields (see below), the email content is copied into them.
5. Assignees of the first task(s) get notified.

### Automatically Capture Email Content

You can have Tallyfy automatically save the email's body and attachments into kick-off form fields. To do this, add [kick-off fields](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/) to your template with these exact names:

| Field Name        | What it Captures        | Recommended Field Type |
|-------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| `email_body`      | The full text of the email | Long Text Area         |
| `email_attachments` | Any files attached to the email | File Upload            |

If you don't have these fields, Tallyfy might offer a link to create them when you enable the email trigger.

### Email Address Format

The special email address looks like this:

```
bot+[TemplateID]-launch@tallyfy.com
```

(Where `[TemplateID]` is the unique ID of your template, found in the editor URL).

### Example Uses

*   **Field Updates**: Technicians email updates after site visits (Subject: Site Visit - Client X; Body: Details; Attachments: Photos).
*   **Forwarding Requests**: Support forwards a customer email to the trigger address to start a complaint resolution process.

### Important Security Notes

*   The sender **must** be an active Tallyfy member in your organization.
*   Use clear email subjects, as they become the process name.
*   Email addresses are unique to each template.
*   Remember: **Cannot** launch templates with required kick-off fields via email.

### Adding Comments by Replying to Task Emails

Separately, you can also add comments to *existing* tasks by simply replying to the notification email Tallyfy sends you for that task.

<Steps>
1. Get a task notification email from Tallyfy.
2. Reply to that email.
3. Your reply text becomes a comment on the task.
4. Any files you attach to the reply are added to the comment.
</Steps>

(The reply-to address for comments looks like `bot+[TaskID]-comment-task@tallyfy.com`)

### Tips for Using Email Triggers

- Keep a list of the trigger email addresses for your team.
- Suggest standard email subject formats for easier process tracking.
- Remind users to put details in the email body if you're capturing it.
- Test it works from different email programs your team uses.
