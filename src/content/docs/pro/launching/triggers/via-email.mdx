## Email-triggered process launches

Tallyfy allows you to initiate processes automatically by sending emails to designated addresses. This feature enables streamlined process initiation without logging into the platform.

:::note[Kickoff form limitation]
Email-triggered launches will not work for templates with **Required** kickoff form fields. If you attempt to launch such templates via email, you'll receive a failure notification.
:::

## Configuring email triggers

To set up email-based process launching:

1. Navigate to the edit view of your template
2. Locate the **Triggers** section
3. Select **Other options**

4. Choose the **Via inbound email** option
5. The system displays the email address to use for launching this process

## Capturing email content

You can automatically capture email content in kickoff fields:

* **Email body** - Store the email text in a dedicated field
* **Attachments** - Save email attachments to a file field

If these specially named kickoff fields don't exist in your template, you can create them by clicking the "CREATE IT NOW" link.

## Email address format

The standard format for process launch email addresses is:

```
bot+[TemplateID]-launch@tallyfy.com
```

The TemplateID is visible in the URL when editing your template.

## Important considerations

When using email triggers, note these key requirements:

1. The sender's email address must match a member in the organization (security measure)
2. The email subject becomes the process name
3. The template and organization IDs must be valid
4. Templates with required kickoff fields cannot be launched via email

## Task commenting via email

You can also add comments to tasks by responding to task notification emails:

1. Reply to a task notification email
2. The email body content becomes your comment text
3. The email subject is not used for the comment

The email address format for task comments is:

```
bot+TASKID-comment-task@tallyfy.com
```
