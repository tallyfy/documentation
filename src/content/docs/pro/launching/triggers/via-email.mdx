### What prerequisites are needed for email-triggered process launching?

*   Permission to edit Tallyfy速 templates for configuration access.
*   The template you want to launch via email should have no required kick-off form fields. Optional fields are fine.
*   The email address you send from must belong to an active member in your Tallyfy速 organization for security.

These requirements ensure proper setup and secure operation of email-based workflow triggers.

### How can I launch processes by sending an email?

Tallyfy速 lets you start a specific process by sending an email to a special address. This is useful for starting workflows without logging into Tallyfy速, especially for users on the go or when working from external systems.

Email triggers provide a convenient, accessible method for workflow initiation that works from any email client.

:::warning[Cannot use with required kick-off fields]
This email trigger method **doesn't work** if the template has any kick-off form fields marked as **Required**. You'll get an email saying the launch failed. Only use templates with optional (or no) kick-off fields if you want to launch them via email.
:::

### How can I set up email triggers for templates?

Each template gets its own unique email address for launching, ensuring targeted workflow initiation.

<Steps>
1. Go to the **Templates** library.
2. Open the template you want to enable email launch for (in **Edit** mode).
3. Click **Triggers** in the left sidebar.
4. Choose **Other options**.

5. Find the **Via inbound email** option.
6. Tallyfy shows the special email address created just for launching *this template*. Copy this address.
7. Share this address with team members who need to launch this process via email.
</Steps>

### How does the email trigger process work automatically?

When someone sends an email to that special address, the following automated sequence occurs:

1. Tallyfy checks if the sender's email belongs to an active member in your organization for security verification.
2. If yes, Tallyfy starts a new process from the template linked to that address.
3. The email's Subject becomes the Name of the new process instance for easy identification.
4. If you added special kick-off fields (see below), the email content copies into them automatically.
5. Assignees for the first task(s) are notified to begin work.

This automated workflow ensures seamless process initiation while maintaining security and proper organization.

### How can I automatically capture email content in processes?

You can have Tallyfy automatically save the email body and attachments into kick-off form fields for comprehensive data capture. To do this, add kick-off fields to your template with these specific internal names:

| Field Name              | What it Captures                  | Recommended Field Type |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------|
| `email_body`            | The full text of the email body   | Long Text Area         |
| `email_attachments`     | Any files attached to the email | File Upload            |

If you don't have these fields, Tallyfy might show a link to create them when you enable the email trigger.

### What is the email address format for triggers?

The trigger email address follows this standardized format:

```text
bot+[TemplateID]-launch@tallyfy.com
```

(Where `[TemplateID]` is the unique ID of your template)

This format ensures proper routing and template identification for automated process launching.

### What are practical example uses for email triggers?

*   **Field Updates**: Technicians email status updates after site visits (Subject: Site Visit - Client X; Body: Details; Attachments: Photos) for immediate workflow initiation.
*   **Forwarding Requests**: Support forwards an email to the trigger address to start a complaint process for streamlined issue management.

These examples demonstrate how email triggers can bridge external communications with internal workflow automation.

### What security considerations apply to email triggers?

*   The sender must be an active Tallyfy member in your organization for access control.
*   Use clear email subjects (they become the process name) for proper identification.
*   Each template has a unique trigger email for targeted workflow initiation.
*   Remember: Cannot launch templates with required kick-off fields via email due to technical limitations.

These security measures ensure only authorized users can initiate workflows while maintaining proper process identification.

### How can I add comments by replying to task emails?

Separately, you can also add comments to existing tasks by simply replying to the Tallyfy task notification email for streamlined communication.

<Steps>
1. Get a task notification email from Tallyfy.
2. Reply to that email.
3. Your reply becomes a comment on the task.
4. Files attached to the reply are added to the comment.
</Steps>

(The reply-to address for comments looks like `bot+[TaskID]-comment-task@tallyfy.com`)

### What are best practices for using email triggers effectively?

- Keep a list of trigger emails for your team to ensure proper access and usage.
- Suggest standard subject formats for easier tracking and process identification.
- Remind users to put details in the body if you're capturing it for comprehensive data collection.
- Test the trigger from different email clients your team uses to ensure compatibility.

These practices maximize the effectiveness of email-triggered workflows while maintaining consistency and reliability.
