Send an email to a template's unique address to start a process without logging into Tallyfy. This works well for mobile users or when you're working from external systems.

### Prerequisites

- Permission to edit templates
- No **required** kick-off form fields in the template (optional fields are fine)
- Sender's email must belong to an active member in your organization

:::warning[Cannot use with required kick-off fields]
Email triggers **don't work** if the template has any kick-off form fields marked as **Required**. You'll get a failure notification email. Only use templates with optional (or no) kick-off fields for email launching.
:::

### Setting up email triggers

Each template gets its own unique email address.

<Steps>
1. Open a template in **Edit** mode.
2. Click **Triggers** in the left sidebar.
3. Choose **Other options**.

4. Find the **Via inbound email** option.
5. Copy the email address shown - it's unique to this template.
6. Share this address with team members who need to launch this process via email.
</Steps>

### What happens when an email arrives

1. Tallyfy checks if the sender is an active member in your organization. Non-members get a rejection email.
2. If verified, Tallyfy launches a new process from the linked template.
3. The email **Subject** becomes the process name.
4. If you've set up email capture fields (see below), the body and attachments fill in automatically.
5. Assignees on the first task(s) get notified.

## How does the email trigger process work?

This diagram shows the full validation flow and possible outcomes.

### Capturing email content

Tallyfy can save the email body and attachments into kick-off form fields. When you open the **Via inbound email** trigger panel, Tallyfy offers to create these fields for you with a **Create it now** link:

| Field Label              | What it captures                  | Field type |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------|
| `Inbound Email Trigger - Email Body`            | The full text of the email body   | Long Text Area         |
| `Inbound Email Trigger - Email Attachments`     | Files attached to the email | File Upload            |

These fields are optional. Without them, the process still launches - you just won't capture the email content.

### Email address format

The trigger email address follows this pattern:

```text
bot+[TemplateID]-launch@tallyfy.com
```

`[TemplateID]` is your template's unique ID. You don't need to construct this yourself - Tallyfy shows the full address in the trigger panel.

### Example uses

- **Site visit reports** - Technicians email after visits (Subject: Site Visit - Client X; Body: details; Attachments: photos)
- **Support escalation** - Forward a customer email to the trigger address to start a complaint process

:::caution[Consider structured forms instead]
Email triggers work, but emails are unstructured - people write whatever they want, in any format. This creates data quality issues.

**Better approach**: Use [kick-off forms](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/) instead. Structured forms give you consistent data formats, required fields, and validation before the process starts.

Use email triggers as a fallback, not your primary launch method.
:::

### Smart email forwarding with keywords

You can launch Tallyfy processes from regular email conversations using a keyword and an email filter rule.

1. Pick a unique keyword like `TRIGGER-TALLYFY`
2. Set up an email rule in Gmail, Outlook, or your mail system that:
   - Watches for emails containing your keyword
   - Auto-forwards matches to the Tallyfy template address
3. The process launches when Tallyfy receives the forwarded email

Use different keywords for different templates (e.g., `TRIGGER-ONBOARDING`, `TRIGGER-COMPLAINT`).

**Gmail example:**
1. Go to **Settings** > **Filters and Blocked Addresses**
2. Create filter: "Has the words: TRIGGER-TALLYFY"
3. Action: Forward to `bot+[TemplateID]-launch@tallyfy.com`

### Security notes

- Only active Tallyfy members in your organization can trigger launches - emails from outsiders are rejected
- Each template has its own unique trigger email address
- Write clear subjects - they become the process name

### Adding comments via email replies

You can add comments to existing tasks by replying to Tallyfy task notification emails.

<Steps>
1. Receive a task notification email from Tallyfy.
2. Reply to that email.
3. Your reply becomes a comment on the task.
4. File attachments in the reply get added to the comment.
</Steps>

The reply-to address format is `bot+[TaskID]-comment-task@tallyfy.com`.

### Best practices

- Keep a shared list of trigger email addresses for your team
- Agree on standard subject line formats for easier tracking
- Test the trigger from each email client your team uses
