description: Tallyfy templates can be launched via email by sending messages to unique
  template addresses which automatically creates new process instances using the email
  subject as the process name while capturing email content and attachments in designated
  kick-off form fields.

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

### Prerequisites

*   Permission to edit templates.
*   No required kick-off form fields in the template (optional fields are fine).
*   Email must be sent from an active member's address.

### Launching processes via email

Send an email to a template's unique address to start a process without logging into Tallyfy. Useful for mobile users or when working from external systems.

:::warning[Cannot use with required kick-off fields]
This email trigger method **doesn't work** if the template has any kick-off form fields marked as **Required**. You'll get an email saying the launch failed. Only use templates with optional (or no) kick-off fields if you want to launch them via email.
:::

### Setting up email triggers

Each template gets its own unique email address for launching.

<Steps>
1. Go to the **Templates** library.
2. Open the template you want to enable email launch for (in **Edit** mode).
3. Click **Triggers** in the left sidebar.
4. Choose **Other options**.
   ![Select Other options in Triggers menu](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-select-other-options-triggers.png)
5. Find the **Via inbound email** option.
6. Tallyfy shows the special email address created just for launching *this template*. Copy this address.
7. Share this address with team members who need to launch this process via email.
</Steps>

### Email trigger workflow

When someone sends an email to that special Tallyfy address:

1. Tallyfy checks if the sender's email belongs to an active member in your organization.
2. If yes, Tallyfy starts a new process from the template linked to that address.
3. The email's Subject becomes the Name of the new process instance.
4. If you added special kick-off fields (see below), the email content copies into them automatically.
5. Assignees for the first task(s) are notified to begin work.

## How does the email trigger process work automatically?

This diagram shows the complete email trigger flow, including all validation checks and possible outcomes.

**What to notice:**
- The sender must be an active member in your organization - emails from external addresses or inactive members are automatically rejected
- Templates with required kick-off fields cannot be launched via email - you'll receive a failure notification if you try
- Email content and attachments are only captured if you've specifically added `email_body` or `email_attachments` fields to your template's kick-off form

### Capturing email content

You can have Tallyfy automatically save the email body and attachments into kick-off form fields. Add kick-off fields to your template with these specific internal names:

| Field Name              | What it Captures                  | Recommended Field Type |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------|
| `email_body`            | The full text of the email body   | Long Text Area         |
| `email_attachments`     | Any files attached to the email | File Upload            |

If you don't have these fields, Tallyfy might show a link to create them when you enable the email trigger.

### Email address format

The trigger email address follows this format:

```text
bot+[TemplateID]-launch@tallyfy.com
```

(Where `[TemplateID]` is the unique ID of your template)

### Example uses

*   **Field Updates**: Technicians email status updates after site visits (Subject: Site Visit - Client X; Body: Details; Attachments: Photos).
*   **Forwarding Requests**: Support forwards an email to the trigger address to start a complaint process.

### Security considerations

*   The sender must be an active Tallyfy member in your organization.
*   Use clear email subjects (they become the process name).
*   Each template has a unique trigger email.
*   Cannot launch templates with required kick-off fields via email.

### Adding comments via email replies

You can also add comments to existing tasks by replying to the Tallyfy task notification email.

<Steps>
1. Get a task notification email from Tallyfy.
2. Reply to that email.
3. Your reply becomes a comment on the task.
4. Files attached to the reply are added to the comment.
</Steps>

(The reply-to address for comments looks like `bot+[TaskID]-comment-task@tallyfy.com`)

### Best practices

- Keep a list of trigger emails for your team.
- Suggest standard subject formats for easier tracking.
- Remind users to put details in the body if you're capturing it.
- Test the trigger from different email clients your team uses.
