description: Tallyfy allows you to automatically launch a new process from a different
  template when a specific task completes by configuring the trigger task's advanced
  settings to either start a separate process or inject tasks into the current workflow.

## How to automatically start another process when a task is completed

### What you need

*   Permission to edit Tallyfy [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).
*   At least two templates: one ("trigger") with the task that starts the action, and another ("target") that you want to launch automatically.
*   An understanding of how the processes should link together.

### Overview: Linking processes together

Tallyfy lets you set up a link so that when a specific [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in one process finishes, it automatically starts a new [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) based on a different template. This is useful for complex workflows broken down into multiple templates (like project phases).

### When to use this

*   **Multi-phase projects**: Finishing Phase 1 automatically starts the Phase 2 process.
*   **Customer journeys**: Finishing the "Sales" process automatically starts the "Onboarding" process.
*   **Branching workflows**: Completing an "Initial Review" task might launch either an "Approved Project" process or a "Further Review" process.
*   **Team hand-offs**: Finishing a task by Sales automatically launches a process for Operations.

### How to set it up

<Steps>
1. Go to the **Templates** library.
2. Open the template containing the task you want to use as the trigger (the task that starts the next process). Edit this template.
3. Click the specific trigger step.
4. In the step settings panel (usually right side), go to the **Advanced** tab.
5. Find the toggle **Launch another process when this task is complete** and switch it ON.
6. A dropdown menu appears. Select the target [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) (the template to launch automatically).
7. Save changes to the trigger template.
</Steps>

### Option: Inject tasks instead of launching new process

Instead of starting a separate new process, you can insert the tasks from the target template directly into the current running process.

<Steps>
1. Follow steps 1-5 above.
2. Switch ON the **Inject tasks into existing process** option (this appears after enabling "Launch another process...").
3. Select the target template whose tasks you want to inject.
4. Save your changes.
</Steps>

:::note[What "inject tasks" does]
Injecting tasks adds all steps from the target template into the current process instance, right after the trigger task. Everything stays within the same process, just with added steps. This keeps related work connected in one place.
:::

### Which templates can be launched/injected?

The dropdown list for the target template only shows templates that:
* Are active (not archived).
* Have **no** required [kick-off form fields](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/) (as there's no user present to fill them in during automatic launch).
* You have permission to launch.

:::warning[Can't find your template?]
If the template you want isn't listed, check if it's active, has no required kick-off fields, and that you have launch permissions for it.
:::

### Naming the automatically launched process

You can control the name of the new process launched automatically:

1. Use the default name: "Month day - hh:mm - Template Name".
2. Create a custom name using text plus data [variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/) from the *trigger* process's kick-off form.
3. Click the `{}` button to insert available variables from required kick-off fields.

### Limitations (advanced)

* **Naming variables**: You can only use variables from required kick-off form fields of the *trigger* process when customizing the *launched* process name.
* **Passing data**: There isn't currently a built-in way to automatically pass data from the trigger process to fields in the launched process (other than via the name). For complex data transfer, consider using the Tallyfy [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) or [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) with [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/).
* **Referencing data**: You cannot easily reference data between original and injected tasks when using injection.

### Tracking the connection

Tallyfy automatically links the trigger and launched processes:

1. The launched process gets hidden tags identifying the trigger process and task.
2. The Tallyfy Bot adds a comment to the trigger task, including a link to the newly launched process.

This helps you see connections and check the automation worked.
