## Configuring task-triggered process launches

Tallyfy allows you to automatically launch a new process when a specific task completes. This feature enables process chaining for complex workflows that span multiple templates.

## Configuration steps

1. In template edit mode, select the step that should trigger a new process
2. Navigate to the **Advanced** tab
3. Enable the toggle for **Launch another process when this task is complete**

4. Select the template to launch from the dropdown menu

## Process injection option

:::note[Inject tasks into existing process]
Instead of creating a separate process, you can inject tasks from another template into the current process by enabling **Inject tasks into existing process**.

This creates a unified workflow by inserting all tasks from the selected template into the current process at the position of the triggering task.
:::

## Template selection limitations

Only templates meeting these criteria will appear in the dropdown:
* Active templates (not archived)
* Templates without required kickoff form fields
* Templates you have permission to launch

## Naming the triggered process

You can customize the name of the launched process:

1. Use the default format: "Month day - hh:mm - Template Name"
2. Create a custom name using text and variables
3. Insert variables using the curly brackets button to include values from required kickoff fields

## Current limitations

* You can only insert variables from required kickoff fields in the current process
* Direct field mapping between processes is under development
* For complex data passing, use webhooks with external middleware to launch and populate the new process

## Parent-child process relationship

Tallyfy maintains a traceable link between processes:

1. The system automatically tags the child process with the unique ID of:
   * The parent process
   * The triggering task
   * The step that initiated the launch

2. The Tallyfy Bot adds a comment in the activity log of the triggering task

This tagging system enables clear tracking of process relationships and automation verification.
