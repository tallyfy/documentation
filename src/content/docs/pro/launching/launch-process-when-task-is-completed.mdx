title: Launch another process when a task is completed
---

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

You can configure any [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in a Tallyfy [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) to automatically launch a new [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) from a different template when that task is completed. This is useful for multi-phase workflows, customer journeys, and team hand-offs.

### When to use this

*   **Multi-phase projects** - finishing Phase 1 automatically starts Phase 2.
*   **Customer journeys** - completing "Sales" launches "Onboarding".
*   **Branching workflows** - an "Initial Review" task launches either "Approved Project" or "Further Review".
*   **Team hand-offs** - a Sales task triggers a process for Operations.

### How to set it up

<Steps>
1. Open the template containing the trigger task and edit it.
2. Click the specific trigger step.
3. Go to the **Advanced** tab in the step settings panel.
4. Switch ON **Launch another process when this task is complete**.
5. A dropdown appears. Select the target [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) to launch.
6. Save your changes.
</Steps>

### Inject tasks instead of launching a new process

Instead of launching a separate process, you can inject the target template's tasks directly into the current running process. All injected steps appear after the trigger task, keeping everything in one place.

<Steps>
1. Follow steps 1-4 above.
2. Switch ON **Inject tasks into existing process?** (appears after enabling the launch toggle).
3. Select the target template.
4. Save your changes.
</Steps>

:::note[What "inject tasks" does]
Injecting adds all steps from the target template into the current process instance, right after the trigger task. Everything stays in the same process - just with added steps. You can't inject from the same template twice.
:::

### Which templates can be launched or injected?

The dropdown only shows templates that:
* Are active (not archived or deleted).
* Have **no** required [kick-off form fields](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/) - since there's no user present to fill them in during automatic launch.
* Are of type Procedure (with steps) or Form (with kick-off fields only) - not Document type.

:::warning[Can't find your template?]
If a template isn't listed, check that it's active, has no required kick-off fields, and isn't a Document-type template.
:::

### Naming the launched process

You can control the name of the automatically launched process:

1. **Default name** - format is "Mon dd, h:mma - Template Name" (e.g. "Feb 26, 3:45pm - Client Onboarding").
2. **Custom name** - use text plus [variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/) from the trigger process. Available variables include DATE, TEMPLATE_NAME, and text-type kick-off form fields.

### Limitations

* **Naming variables** - only DATE, TEMPLATE_NAME, and text-type kick-off form fields from the trigger process are available for custom naming.
* **Passing data** - there's no built-in way to pass data from the trigger process to the launched process (other than via the name). For complex data transfer, use the Tallyfy [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) or [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) with [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/).
* **Referencing data** - you can't reference data between original and injected tasks when using injection.
* **Duplicate prevention** - if a process was already launched from a specific task, it won't launch again. Tallyfy adds a comment explaining this.

### Tracking the connection

Tallyfy automatically links trigger and launched processes:

1. The trigger task and launched process are tracked in a relationship table - so you can trace which task launched which process.
2. The Tallyfy Bot adds a comment to the trigger task with a link to the newly launched process.
