## Automatically launch another process when a task is completed

Here's how you can launch a new process when a task is completed:

1. Select the step from the template that should trigger the launch of a new process.

2. Click "Advanced" and toggle "Launch another process when this task is complete"

3. Choose a template from the dropdown to launch an automated process.

:::note[Inject tasks into existing process?]

If you toggle the **Inject tasks into existing process** option "Yes", rather than spawning a new process when the task is completed, it will add all the tasks of the template selected to the _current_ process.

Imagine a sandwich with some stuffing in between two slices of bread. By injecting another process into the current one - you are adding _more stuffing_ into your _existing_ sandwich.

:::

You will only be able to choose templates which do _not_ have any required kick off form fields - because you cannot automatically launch a process where kick-off form fields are required (since they might not exist otherwise). Also note that archived templates won't appear in the dropdown list.

4. Customize the name of the process that will be launched using the "Insert variables" handle, or leave it to the default format "Month day - hh:mm - Template Name" for automatically launched processes. The curly brackets on the top right of the process name editor let you pick variables - which are essentially any required fields within the current template you're in.

At present, you can only insert variables into your newly launched process name that are required kick off fields in the current process.

Limitation - we are currently working on the ability for you to "map" fields from the current process into fields in the new process, essentially letting you pass through data from the first process to the newly launched one. An example of this mapping (coming soon) will be something like a short text field "Enter first name" in the current process being mapped to another short text field "First name" in the newly launched process. 

The workaround for this limitation at present is to emit a webhook on a task, catch it via external middleware and then launch another process. Since a webhook already has all the data present in the current process, you can match/copy that data into the new process when you launch it, in specific fields. 

## The link between two processes - tags

To know if the automation happened, look out for the Tallyfy Bot commenting on the task where the automation took place under the activity tab. Just go to your process and click on Settings > Activity:

When the parallel process or "child" launches, it will be automatically tagged with the unique ID of the task, process, and step that spawned it. This ensures a traceable, unique link between the parent and child process.
