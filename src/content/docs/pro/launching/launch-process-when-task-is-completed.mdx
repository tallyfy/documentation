snippet: Tallyfy enables automatic process chaining by allowing new processes to launch
  or inject tasks when specific tasks are completed with customizable naming options
  and traceable parent-child relationships between connected workflows.

## Prerequisites

Before configuring task-triggered process launches, ensure you have:
- A Tallyfy account with template editing permissions
- At least two process templates (trigger template and target template)
- Clear understanding of your process chain requirements

## Overview

Tallyfy allows you to automatically launch a new process when a specific task completes. This feature enables process chaining for complex workflows that span multiple templates, creating seamless transitions between related processes.

## Use cases

Task-triggered process launches are ideal for:
- Multi-phase projects where completion of one phase triggers the next
- Customer journeys that require different process templates at different stages
- Workflows that branch into multiple sub-processes based on task outcomes
- Scenarios where different teams handle different parts of a larger process

## Configuration steps

1. Navigate to the **Templates** section
2. Open the template containing the trigger task in edit mode
3. Select the step that should trigger a new process
4. Navigate to the **Advanced** tab in the task settings
5. Enable the toggle for **Launch another process when this task is complete**
6. Select the template to launch from the dropdown menu
7. Save your changes

## Process injection option

As an alternative to launching a separate process, you can inject tasks from another template into the current process:

1. Follow steps 1-5 above
2. Enable the **Inject tasks into existing process** option
3. Select the template whose tasks should be injected
4. Save your changes

:::note[Injection benefits]
Task injection creates a unified workflow by inserting all tasks from the selected template into the current process at the position of the triggering task. This approach maintains a single process instance rather than creating separate processes.

## Template selection limitations

Only templates meeting these criteria will appear in the dropdown:
* Active templates (not archived)
* Templates without required kickoff form fields
* Templates you have permission to launch

:::warning[Missing templates]
If you don't see an expected template in the dropdown, verify it's active, doesn't have required kickoff fields, and that you have launch permissions for it.
:::

## Naming the triggered process

You can customize the name of the launched process:

1. Use the default format: "Month day - hh:mm - Template Name"
2. Create a custom name using text and variables
3. Insert variables using the **{}** button to include values from required kickoff fields

## Current limitations

* You can only insert variables from required kickoff fields in the current process
* Direct field mapping between processes is under development
* For complex data passing, use webhooks with external middleware to launch and populate the new process

## Parent-child process relationship

Tallyfy automatically maintains a traceable link between processes:

1. The system tags the child process with the unique identifiers of:
   * The parent process
   * The triggering task
   * The step that initiated the launch

2. The Tallyfy Bot adds a comment in the activity log of the triggering task with a link to the child process

This tagging system enables clear tracking of process relationships and verification of automation functioning correctly.
