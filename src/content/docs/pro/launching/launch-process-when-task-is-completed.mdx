## How to automatically start another process when a task is completed

### What you need

- Permission to edit Tallyfy [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).
- At least two templates: one with the "trigger" task, and one that you want to launch automatically (the "target" template).
- To understand how you want the processes linked.

### Overview: Linking Processes Together

Tallyfy lets you set up a connection so that when a specific [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in one process finishes, it automatically starts a new [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) based on a different template. This is useful for complex workflows that are broken down into multiple templates (like different phases of a project).

### When to use this

- **Multi-phase projects**: Finishing Phase 1 automatically starts the Phase 2 process.
- **Customer journeys**: Finishing the "Sales" process automatically starts the "Onboarding" process.
- **Branching workflows**: Completing an "Initial Review" task might launch either an "Approved Project" process or a "Further Review Needed" process, depending on the outcome.
- **Team handoffs**: Finishing a task by the Sales team automatically launches a process for the Operations team.

### How to set it up

<Steps>
1. Go to the **Templates** library.
2. Open the template that contains the task you want to use as the trigger (the task that, when completed, will start the next process). Edit this template.
3. Click on the specific trigger step.
4. In the step settings panel (usually on the right), go to the **Advanced** tab.
5. Find the toggle switch labeled **Launch another process when this task is complete** and turn it ON.
6. A dropdown menu will appear. Select the target [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) (the one you want to launch automatically).
7. Save your changes to the trigger template.
</Steps>

### Option: Inject Tasks Instead of Launching New Process

Instead of starting a completely separate new process, you can choose to insert the tasks from the target template directly into the current running process.

<Steps>
1. Follow steps 1-5 above.
2. Turn ON the **Inject tasks into existing process** option (this appears after you enable "Launch another process...").
3. Select the target template whose tasks you want to inject.
4. Save your changes.
</Steps>

:::note[What "Inject Tasks" does]
When you inject tasks, all the steps from the target template are added into the current process right after the trigger task. It all stays within the same single process run, just making it longer. This keeps everything together in one place.
:::

### Which templates can be launched/injected?

The dropdown list where you choose the target template will only show templates that:
* Are active (not archived).
* Do **not** have any required [kick-off form fields](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/) (because there's no user to fill them in during automatic launch).
* You have permission to launch.

:::warning[Can't find your template?]
If the template you want to launch isn't showing up in the list, check that it's active, has no required kick-off fields, and that you have permission to launch it.
:::

### Naming the automatically launched process

You can control the name given to the new process that gets launched automatically:

1. Use the default name format: "Month day - hh:mm - Template Name".
2. Create a custom name using your own text plus data [variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/) from the *parent* process's kick-off form.
3. Click the **{}** button to insert variables from required kick-off fields.

### Limitations (Advanced)

* **Naming variables**: You can only use variables from required *kick-off form fields* of the parent process when customizing the child process name.
* **Passing data**: There isn't currently an easy, built-in way to automatically pass data from form fields in the parent process to fields in the child process (other than via the name). For complex data passing, you might need to use the Tallyfy [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) or [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) with [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/).
* **Referencing data**: You cannot easily reference data between the original parent tasks and the injected tasks if you use the injection method.

### Tracking the Connection

Tallyfy automatically links the parent and child processes:

1. The child process gets hidden tags identifying the parent process and the trigger task.
2. The Tallyfy Bot adds a comment to the trigger task in the parent process, including a link to the newly launched child process.

This helps you see how processes are connected and verify the automation worked.
