snippet: Tallyfy enables automatic process chaining by allowing new processes to launch
  or inject tasks when specific tasks are completed with customizable naming options
  and traceable parent-child relationships between connected workflows.

## Prerequisites

Before configuring task-triggered [process launches](/products/pro/launching/), ensure you have:
- A Tallyfy account with [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) editing permissions
- At least two [process templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) (trigger template and target template)
- Clear understanding of your process chain requirements

## Overview

Tallyfy allows you to automatically [launch](/products/pro/launching/) a new [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) when a specific [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) completes. This feature enables process chaining for complex workflows that span multiple templates, creating seamless transitions between related processes.

## Use cases

[Task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/)-triggered [process launches](/products/pro/launching/) are ideal for:
- Multi-phase projects where completion of one phase triggers the next
- Customer journeys that require different [process templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) at different stages
- Workflows that branch into multiple sub-processes based on task outcomes
- Scenarios where different teams handle different parts of a larger process

## Configuration steps

1. Navigate to the **Templates** section
2. Open the template containing the trigger task in edit mode
3. Select the step that should trigger a new [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)
4. Navigate to the **Advanced** tab in the [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) settings
5. Enable the toggle for **[Launch another process](/products/pro/launching/launch-process-when-task-is-completed/) when this task is complete**
6. Select the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) to launch from the dropdown menu
7. Save your changes

## Process injection option

As an alternative to [launching](/products/pro/launching/) a separate [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), you can inject [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) from another [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) into the current process:

1. Follow steps 1-5 above
2. Enable the **Inject tasks into existing process** option
3. Select the template whose tasks should be injected
4. Save your changes

:::note[Injection benefits]
Task injection creates a unified workflow by inserting all [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) from the selected [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) into the current [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) at the position of the triggering task. This approach maintains a single process instance rather than creating separate processes.
:::

:::note[What happens with injected tasks]
When you inject [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/):
- The parent [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) is expanded to include all tasks from the selected [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)
- These injected tasks become part of the same process instance
- The process becomes larger but maintains its original Process ID
- All tasks (original and injected) can be viewed and managed within the same [process view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)
:::

## Template selection limitations

Only [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) meeting these criteria will appear in the dropdown:
* Active templates (not archived)
* Templates without required [kickoff form fields](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/)
* Templates you have permission to [launch](/products/pro/launching/)

:::warning[Missing templates]
If you don't see an expected template in the dropdown, verify it's active, doesn't have required kickoff fields, and that you have launch permissions for it.
:::

## Naming the triggered process

You can customize the name of the [launched process](/products/pro/launching/):

1. Use the default format: "Month day - hh:mm - Template Name"
2. Create a custom name using text and [variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/)
3. Insert variables using the **{}** button to include values from required [kickoff fields](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/)

![Custom naming configuration](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-custom-naming-process.png)

## Current limitations

* You can only insert [variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/) from required [kickoff fields](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/) in the current [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)
* Direct field mapping between processes is under development
* There is no direct way to reference data from a child process in the parent process (like `{{ $parent.$child.task-outcome }}`)
* When using task injection, the parent process becomes larger with the injected [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), but there's still no built-in way to reference data between the original tasks and injected tasks
* For complex data passing between processes, use the Tallyfy [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) to fetch the expanded process and write custom code to manipulate task data
* Alternatively, use [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) with external [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) to launch and populate the new process

## Parent-child process relationship

Tallyfy automatically maintains a traceable link between [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/):

1. The system tags the child process with the unique identifiers of:
   * The parent process
   * The triggering [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/)
   * The step that initiated the [launch](/products/pro/launching/)

2. The Tallyfy Bot adds a comment in the activity log of the triggering task with a link to the child process

![Bot comment in activity log](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy/pro/desktop-light-show-bot-comment.png)

This tagging system enables clear tracking of process relationships and verification of automation functioning correctly.
