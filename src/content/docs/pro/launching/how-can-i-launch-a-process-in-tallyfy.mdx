## Manually launching a process

Click **Launch Process** on any template card, give it a descriptive name, and hit **Launch**. That's the core flow. Templates are reusable definitions - processes are the live, trackable instances you create from them.

Manual launching gives you full control over timing, naming, and per-instance customization before a workflow starts running.

<Steps>
1. Start the launch from either:
    - The **Home** screen - click the **Launch Process** button.
    - The top navigation bar - click **+ Create** > **Process**.
2. Both options open the **Templates** library.

3. Find the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) you want and click **Launch Process** on its card.

4. Give this instance a clear **Name** (max 550 characters). Pick something specific - "Onboard Jane Doe" beats "Employee Onboarding" when you're tracking multiple runs.

5. You can also [change assignees or deadlines](/products/pro/launching/how-can-i-edit-a-process-before-launching/) for this instance on the launch screen.

6. Click the final **Launch** button.

7. Tallyfy starts the [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), notifies assignees about their first [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), and opens the process view.

8. Track all running processes in the **[Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** view.

</Steps>

### Viewing hidden steps in running processes

If your process uses conditional rules that hide certain steps, you can still see them. Open the running process and click the **Show hidden tasks** eye icon in the process toolbar.

*Note: Hidden tasks won't show descriptions or form fields until their conditional rules activate them.*

### Modifying processes after launching

You can change assignees and deadlines on any task after a process is running:

<Steps>
1. Open the running process.
2. Click the specific task you want to change.
3. Use the options in the task panel to update the assignee or deadline.
</Steps>

### Adding ad-hoc tasks to running processes

Need an extra step that wasn't in the original template? You can add tasks on the fly:

<Steps>
1. Open the running process from the **[Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** view.
2. Scroll to the bottom of the task list.
3. Click the **Add task** button.
4. Name the new task and set its details - assignee, deadline, description, etc.
5. This task only exists in this process instance. It doesn't change the original template.
</Steps>

You can add any task type this way - standard, approval, email, or expiring.
