## How to launch a process manually

To launch a process in Tallyfy:

1. From your _Home_ screen, click on _Launch Process_. Alternatively, you can select _+ Create_ and then _Process_. Both options will take you to your _Templates_ view where you can find the template you want to launch:

4. Once the process is launched, you will be taken to the active process view. Each assignee will receive notifications regarding their tasks and deadlines!

5. Keep track of your progress in the _Tracker_ view:

6. If the template you launched has hidden steps, you can choose to view "Hidden steps" in the "Show hidden tasks" option:

![Hidden Tasks](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-click-show-hidden-tasks.png)

7. To make changes to deadlines and assignees, select the desired task and change it from there. Please note that for hidden tasks, you will not be able to view their description and form fields.
