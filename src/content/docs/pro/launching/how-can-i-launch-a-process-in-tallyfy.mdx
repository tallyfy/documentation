## How can I manually launch a process in Tallyfy for workflow execution?

Manual process launching starts new workflow instances based on existing templates, giving you complete control over timing and customization.

Manual launching offers the most flexibility for process initiation, letting you review, customize, and validate workflow details before execution begins. Here's the complete step-by-step guide for manual process launching in Tallyfy:

This approach makes sure each workflow instance is properly configured and ready for optimal execution.

### Why is manual process launching essential for workflow management?

Manual launching gives you essential process initiation control, letting you carefully review and customize before workflow execution begins.

While automated triggers offer efficiency benefits, manual launching lets you verify information and make instance-specific modifications before process activation. This approach is particularly valuable for workflows that need human judgment for initiation timing or processes needing case-specific customizations.

Mastering manual launching builds foundational Tallyfy understanding and enhances workflow management capabilities across your organization.

<Steps>
1. Start the launch from either:
    - The **Home** screen: Click the **Launch Process** button.
    - The top navigation bar: Click **+ Create** > **Process**.
2. Both options open the **Templates** library.

3. Find the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) you want to use and click **Launch Process** on its card.

4. Give this instance of the process a clear **Name**. This helps you distinguish it from other runs of the same template (e.g., "Onboard Jane Doe" instead of just "Employee Onboarding").

5. On this launch screen, you can also [change assignees or deadlines](/products/pro/launching/how-can-i-edit-a-process-before-launching/) just for this instance, if needed.

6. Click the final **Launch** button.

7. Tallyfy<sup>Â®</sup> starts the [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), notifies assignees about their first [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), and opens the process view.

8. You can track all running processes in the **[Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** view.

</Steps>

### How can I view hidden steps in running processes for complete visibility?

When templates utilize conditional rules to hide workflow steps initially, Tallyfy provides viewing options to reveal these hidden elements for comprehensive process oversight:

<Steps>
1. Go to the **[Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** view.
2. Click **Add filter**.
   ![Add filter button in Tracker](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-click-filter.png)
3. Turn on the **Show hidden tasks** option.
    ![Show hidden tasks filter option](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-click-show-hidden-tasks.png)
</Steps>
*Note: Even if you show hidden tasks, you usually can't see descriptions or form fields until rules activate them.*

### How can I modify processes after launching for changing requirements?

Tallyfy enables post-launch process modifications including deadline adjustments and task reassignments, providing flexibility for changing business requirements.

Process modification capabilities ensure workflows remain adaptable to evolving circumstances without requiring complete process restart:

<Steps>
1. Open the running process.
2. Click the specific task you want to change.
3. Use the options in the task panel to change the assignee or deadline.
</Steps>

### How can I add ad-hoc tasks to running processes for unexpected needs?

Unforeseen workflow requirements may necessitate additional steps beyond original template specifications. Tallyfy supports ad-hoc task addition to running processes without disrupting existing workflow execution.

Ad-hoc tasks provide essential flexibility for addressing unique process requirements while maintaining comprehensive workflow tracking and accountability:

<Steps>
1. Open the running process in the **[Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** view.
2. Scroll to the bottom of the task list for that process.
3. Click the **Add task** button.
4. Name the new task and set its details (assignee, deadline, description, etc.).
5. The task is added only to this specific instance of the process; it doesn't affect the original template.
</Steps>

You can add any type of task (regular, approval, email, expiring) this way.

## What should I learn next about process launching?

After learning how to manually launch processes, you might want to explore how to edit a process before launching for more customization options. If you need to automate process launching based on certain events, check out how to launch another process when a task is completed.

These advanced capabilities enable more sophisticated workflow automation and management.
