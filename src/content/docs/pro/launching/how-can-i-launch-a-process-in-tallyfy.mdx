## Manual process launch procedure

To [launch](/products/pro/launching/) a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) in Tallyfy:

<Steps>
1. Navigate to your process launch options:
   * From the **Home** screen, click **Launch Process**, or
   * Click **+ Create** and select **Process**

   Either option takes you to the **Templates** view:

![Launch Process](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-launch-process-from-home.png)

2. Find your desired [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) and click **Launch Process**:

![Select Launch Process](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-click-launch-process.png)

3. Enter a descriptive **Name** for your process. This name should clearly identify this specific process instance:

![Name Process](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-name-process-before-launch.png)

4. After naming, you can modify [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) assignees and deadlines if needed.

5. Once launched, the system displays the active process view and notifies all assignees about their [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) and deadlines.

6. Track process progress through the **[Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** view:

</Steps>

### Managing hidden steps

If your [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) contains hidden steps:

<Steps>
1. Click **Add filter** in the [Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/) view
2. Enable the **Show hidden tasks** option:

![Add filter](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-click-filter.png)

![Hidden Tasks](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-click-show-hidden-tasks.png)
</Steps>

### Modifying an active Process

To adjust deadlines or reassign [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in an active [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/):

<Steps>
1. Select the task you wish to modify
2. Change assignees or deadlines as needed
</Steps>

Note: Hidden [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/)\' descriptions and [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) remain inaccessible even when viewing hidden tasks.

### Adding ad-hoc Tasks to active Processes

After [launching](/products/pro/launching/) a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), you're not limited to just the [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) defined in the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). You can add ad-hoc one-off tasks at any time:

<Steps>
1. Open your active process in the [Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/) view
2. Scroll to the bottom where you'll see the **"Add task"** option
3. Enter a name for your new ad-hoc task and configure its settings
4. The new task will be added to the specific process instance only
</Steps>

Ad-hoc [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) can be of any task type (regular tasks, approval tasks, email tasks, or expiring tasks), giving you flexibility to adapt [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) to specific circumstances without modifying the original template.
