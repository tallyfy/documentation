## How can I manually launch a process in Tallyfy for workflow execution?

To launch a process from a template (called "Blueprint" in the API), click **Launch Process** on the template card and give it a unique name. Templates are reusable blueprints, while processes are the actual running instances you track.

Manual process launching in Tallyfy starts new workflow instances that ensure every step is considered each time a process runs - so nothing is missed. Based on existing templates with smart process capabilities, launching gives you complete control over timing and customization.

Manual launching offers the most flexibility for initiating smart processes that will ask for user input and modify the flow based on that input. Here's the complete step-by-step guide for manual process launching in Tallyfy:

This approach makes sure each workflow instance is properly configured to track all elements as part of a larger workflow, preventing problems later.

### Why is manual process launching essential for workflow management?

Manual launching gives you essential Tallyfy process initiation control, ensuring every step is considered before workflow execution begins. This prevents problems later by allowing careful review and customization.

While automated triggers offer efficiency benefits, manual launching lets you verify that smart processes are configured to ask for the right user input and modify their flow appropriately. This approach is particularly valuable for workflows with integrated client-facing forms and tasks that need human judgment for initiation timing.

Mastering manual launching builds foundational understanding of how Tallyfy ensures nothing falls through the cracks in your workflows.

<Steps>
1. Start the launch from either:
    - The **Home** screen: Click the **Launch Process** button.
    - The top navigation bar: Click **+ Create** > **Process**.
2. Both options open the **Templates** library.

3. Find the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) you want to use and click **Launch Process** on its card.
   ![Click Launch Process on a template card](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-click-launch-process.png)

4. Give this instance of the process a clear **Name**. This helps you distinguish it from other runs of the same template (e.g., "Onboard Jane Doe" instead of just "Employee Onboarding").

5. On this launch screen, you can also [change assignees or deadlines](/products/pro/launching/how-can-i-edit-a-process-before-launching/) just for this instance, if needed.

6. Click the final **Launch** button.

7. Tallyfy starts the [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), notifies assignees about their first [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), and opens the process view.

8. You can track all running processes in the **[Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** view, monitoring everything as part of your larger workflow.

</Steps>

### How can I view hidden steps in running processes for complete visibility?

When smart processes utilize conditional rules to hide workflow steps initially (based on user input), Tallyfy provides viewing options to ensure every step is considered, even those not currently active:

<Steps>
1. Go to the **[Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** view.
2. Click **Add filter**.

3. Turn on the **Show hidden tasks** option.
    ![Show hidden tasks filter option](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-click-show-hidden-tasks.png)
</Steps>
*Note: Even if you show hidden tasks, you usually can't see descriptions or form fields until rules activate them.*

### How can I modify processes after launching for changing requirements?

Tallyfy enables post-launch process modifications to ensure every step remains considered even as requirements change. This prevents problems later by maintaining process integrity while providing flexibility.

Process modification capabilities ensure smart workflows can continue to ask for user input and modify their flow based on new circumstances:

<Steps>
1. Open the running process.
2. Click the specific task you want to change.
3. Use the options in the task panel to change the assignee or deadline.
</Steps>

### How can I add ad-hoc tasks to running processes for unexpected needs?

Unforeseen workflow requirements may necessitate additional steps to ensure nothing is missed. Tallyfy supports ad-hoc task addition to running processes, allowing you to maintain comprehensive tracking as part of your larger workflow.

Ad-hoc tasks ensure that even unexpected requirements are tracked and considered, preventing problems later while maintaining comprehensive workflow visibility:

<Steps>
1. Open the running process in the **[Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** view.
2. Scroll to the bottom of the task list for that process.
3. Click the **Add task** button.
4. Name the new task and set its details (assignee, deadline, description, etc.).
5. The task is added only to this specific instance of the process; it doesn't affect the original template.
</Steps>

You can add any type of task (regular, approval, email, expiring) this way.

## What should I learn next about process launching?

After learning how to manually launch processes, you might want to explore how to edit a process before launching for more customization options. If you need to automate process launching based on certain events, check out how to launch another process when a task is completed.

These advanced capabilities enable more sophisticated workflow automation and management.
