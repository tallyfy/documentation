## Manual process launch procedure

To launch a process in Tallyfy:

1. Navigate to your process launch options:
   * From the **Home** screen, click **Launch Process**, or
   * Click **+ Create** and select **Process**

   Either option takes you to the **Templates** view:

2. Find your desired template and click **Launch Process**:

3. Enter a descriptive **Name** for your process. This name should clearly identify this specific process instance:

4. After naming, you can modify task assignees and deadlines if needed.

5. Once launched, the system displays the active process view and notifies all assignees about their tasks and deadlines.

6. Track process progress through the **Tracker** view:

## Managing hidden steps

If your template contains hidden steps:

1. Click **Add filter** in the Tracker view
2. Enable the **Show hidden tasks** option:

## Modifying an active process

To adjust deadlines or reassign tasks in an active process:

1. Select the task you wish to modify
2. Change assignees or deadlines as needed

Note: Hidden tasks' descriptions and form fields remain inaccessible even when viewing hidden tasks.

## Adding ad-hoc tasks to active processes

After launching a process, you're not limited to just the tasks defined in the template. You can add ad-hoc one-off tasks at any time:

1. Open your active process in the Tracker view
2. Scroll to the bottom where you'll see the **"Add task"** option
3. Enter a name for your new ad-hoc task and configure its settings
4. The new task will be added to the specific process instance only

Ad-hoc tasks can be of any task type (regular tasks, approval tasks, email tasks, or expiring tasks), giving you flexibility to adapt processes to specific circumstances without modifying the original template.
