## Manual process launch procedure

To launch a process in Tallyfy:

   * From the **Home** screen, click **Launch Process**, or
   * Click **+ Create** and select **Process**

   Either option takes you to the **Templates** view:

3. Enter a descriptive **Name** for your process. This name should clearly identify this specific process instance:

4. After naming, you can modify task assignees and deadlines if needed.

5. Once launched, the system displays the active process view and notifies all assignees about their tasks and deadlines.

6. Track process progress through the **Tracker** view:
