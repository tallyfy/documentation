## How to manually launch a process

Launching a process means starting a new instance of a workflow based on a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). Here's how to do it manually in Tallyfy<sup>®</sup>:

### Why manual launching is important

Manual launching gives you control when starting processes. While automated triggers are helpful, manual launching lets you check information and make changes before starting. This is useful for processes that need a person to decide when to start or workflows that need changes for each case. Learning manual launching helps you understand Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> better.

<Steps>
1. Start the launch from either:
    - The **Home** screen: Click the **Launch Process** button.
    - The top navigation bar: Click **+ Create** > **Process**.
2. Both options open the **Templates** library.

3. Find the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) you want to use and click **Launch Process** on its card.

4. Give this instance of the process a clear **Name**. This helps you distinguish it from other runs of the same template (e.g., "Onboard Jane Doe" instead of just "Employee Onboarding").

5. On this launch screen, you can also [change assignees or deadlines](/products/pro/launching/how-can-i-edit-a-process-before-launching/) just for this instance, if needed.

6. Click the final **Launch** button.

7. Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> starts the [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), notifies assignees about their first [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), and opens the process view.

8. You can track all running processes in the **[Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** view.

</Steps>

### Seeing hidden steps in a running process

If your template uses rules to hide steps at the start:

<Steps>
1. Go to the **[Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** view.
2. Click **Add filter**.
   ![Add filter button in Tracker](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-click-filter.png)
3. Turn on the **Show hidden tasks** option.
    ![Show hidden tasks filter option](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-click-show-hidden-tasks.png)
</Steps>
*Note: Even if you show hidden tasks, you usually can't see descriptions or form fields until rules activate them.*

### Changing things in a process after it has launched

You can still adjust deadlines or reassign [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) after a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) has started:

<Steps>
1. Open the running process.
2. Click the specific task you want to change.
3. Use the options in the task panel to change the assignee or deadline.
</Steps>

### Adding extra tasks to a running process (ad-hoc tasks)

Sometimes extra steps are needed that weren't in the original [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). You can add extra tasks (ad-hoc tasks) to a running [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/):

<Steps>
1. Open the running process in the **[Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** view.
2. Scroll to the bottom of the task list for that process.
3. Click the **Add task** button.
4. Name the new task and set its details (assignee, deadline, description, etc.).
5. The task is added only to this specific instance of the process; it doesn't affect the original template.
</Steps>

You can add any type of task (regular, approval, email, expiring) this way.
