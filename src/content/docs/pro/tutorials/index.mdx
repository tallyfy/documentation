## Getting started with Tallyfy tutorials

Start using Tallyfy in minutes by following our step-by-step tutorials. Each guide walks you through essential Tallyfy workflow features - from creating your first template to launching automated workflows. You'll build practical skills that transform how your team works.

**Time to first workflow**: 15 minutes  
**What you'll accomplish**: Create, launch, and track your first business process

:::tip[Quick start - simplest possible workflow]
**Feel overwhelmed?** Start with the absolute minimum:
1. Click **+ Create** → **Create Template** → **From scratch**
2. Add just 3 steps: "Review request" → "Approve/Deny" → "Notify requester"
3. Assign each step to yourself
4. Launch it once to see how it works
5. Then add complexity gradually

Most successful users start simple and expand later. Don't try to build the perfect process on day one.

### Tutorial learning path

Follow these tutorials in order to master Tallyfy quickly. Each builds on the previous one - taking you from setup to your first automated workflow.

1. **Create an organization** - Set up your workspace and invite team members (5 minutes)
2. **Navigate Tallyfy** - Learn the dashboard, tabs, and key features (5 minutes) 
3. **Create your first template** - Build a reusable process blueprint (10 minutes)
4. **Launch your first process** - Turn templates into trackable workflows (5 minutes)

Complete all four tutorials in under 30 minutes. You'll have a working process that your team can use immediately.

### Core skills you'll master

After completing these tutorials, you'll know how to:

* **Build templates** - Create reusable blueprints that standardize any business process
* **Assign work intelligently** - Route tasks to the right people based on roles or workload
* **Track progress in real-time** - See exactly where each process stands and identify bottlenecks
* **Automate routine decisions** - Set up if-then rules that handle repetitive work automatically
* **Collaborate effectively** - Add comments, share files, and keep everyone aligned
* **Scale globally** - Support teams in multiple languages with [translation features](/products/pro/integrations/azure-translation/global-workplace-language-requirements/)

These skills apply to any department - HR onboarding, sales workflows, IT requests, compliance procedures, and more.

### Industry-specific use cases

**Fire stations & emergency services**: Create inspection checklists for daily, weekly, and monthly apparatus checks. Teams complete checks on any device, and reports automatically email to officers. Perfect for maintaining compliance and safety standards.

**Small business outsourcing**: Build repeatable weekly tasks for marketing and production that contractors can follow without training. Assign work to freelancers who see only their specific tasks - maintaining quality while you focus on growth.

**Client service management**: Set up collaborative workflows where clients submit requests that automatically route to your team. Track project status, gather requirements, and deliver updates without endless email chains.

### Getting your team to adopt Tallyfy

**Struggling with team adoption?** Here's what works:

1. **Start small** - Pick one simple process that causes daily pain. Win quick.
2. **Show, don't tell** - Run the process yourself first. Let results speak.
3. **Make it mandatory** - Choose a process people MUST follow (expense reports, time off requests)
4. **Celebrate early wins** - Share time saved, errors prevented, bottlenecks removed
5. **Train champions** - Get one enthusiast per department. They'll spread adoption.
6. **Remove alternatives** - Phase out the old spreadsheet/email method gradually
7. **Track and share metrics** - "We saved 10 hours this week" motivates teams

Most successful organizations see 80% adoption within 60 days when they start with a critical, painful process that affects everyone.

### Evaluating Tallyfy during your trial

**Making the most of your trial period:**

1. **Pick a real process** - Don't use hypothetical examples. Choose an actual workflow you run weekly.
2. **Set success criteria** - Define what "working" means: Time saved? Errors reduced? Visibility improved?
3. **Test with real users** - Include the people who'll actually use it, not just managers
4. **Measure improvements** - Track how long the process takes before and after Tallyfy
5. **Try key features** - Test automations, guest users, notifications, integrations you'll need

**Questions to answer during trial:**
- Can we build our critical processes? (Try your top 3)
- Will our team actually use it? (Get 3+ people to complete tasks)
- Does it integrate with our tools? (Test Zapier, API, or webhooks)
- Is the ROI clear? (Calculate hours saved per week)

:::tip[Trial success indicators]
You'll know Tallyfy fits if: team members ask "when can we add more processes?", you catch errors that usually slip through, or you stop asking "what's the status?" in meetings.
