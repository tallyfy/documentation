## Getting started with Tallyfy tutorials

Start using Tallyfy in minutes with these step-by-step tutorials. New to workflows? Learn [what is a workflow](https://tallyfy.com/what-is-a-workflow/) first. Each guide walks you through a key feature - from creating your first template to launching automated workflows.

**Time to first workflow**: 15 minutes
**What you'll accomplish**: Create, launch, and track your first business process

:::tip[Quick start - simplest possible workflow]
**Feel overwhelmed?** Start with the absolute minimum:
1. Click **+ Create** → **Create Template** → **From scratch**
2. Add just 3 steps: "Review request" → "Approve/Deny" → "Notify requester"
3. Assign each step to yourself
4. Launch it once to see how it works
5. Then add complexity gradually

Most successful users start simple and expand later. Don't try to build the perfect process on day one.

### Tutorial learning path

Follow these in order. Each builds on the previous one.

1. **Create an organization** - Set up your workspace and invite team members (5 min)
2. **Navigate Tallyfy** - Learn the dashboard, tabs, and key features (5 min)
3. **Create your first template** - Build a reusable process blueprint (10 min)
4. **Launch your first process** - Turn templates into trackable workflows (5 min)

All four take under 30 minutes. You'll have a working process your team can use right away.

### Core skills you'll learn

After these tutorials, you'll know how to:

* **Build templates** - Create reusable blueprints that standardize any process
* **Assign work** - Route tasks to the right people based on roles or workload
* **Track progress** - See where each process stands and spot bottlenecks
* **Automate decisions** - Set up if-then rules that handle repetitive work
* **Collaborate** - Add comments, share files, and keep everyone aligned
* **Scale globally** - Support multilingual teams with [translation features](/products/pro/integrations/azure-translation/global-workplace-language-requirements/)

These skills work across any department - HR, sales, IT, compliance, and more.

### Industry-specific use cases

**Fire stations & emergency services** - Create inspection checklists for daily, weekly, and monthly apparatus checks. Teams complete checks on any device, and reports automatically go to officers.

**Small business outsourcing** - Build repeatable weekly tasks that contractors can follow without training. Freelancers see only their specific tasks - you keep quality while focusing on growth.

**Client service management** - Set up workflows where clients submit requests that automatically route to your team. Track status and deliver updates without endless email chains.

### Getting your team to adopt Tallyfy

Here's what works:

1. **Start small** - Pick one process that causes daily pain. Win quick.
2. **Show, don't tell** - Run it yourself first. Let results speak.
3. **Make it mandatory** - Choose a process people MUST follow (expense reports, time off requests)
4. **Celebrate early wins** - Share time saved, errors prevented, bottlenecks removed
5. **Train champions** - Get one enthusiast per department. They'll spread adoption.
6. **Remove alternatives** - Phase out the old spreadsheet/email method gradually
7. **Track and share metrics** - "We saved 10 hours this week" motivates teams

Adoption works best when you start with a painful process that affects everyone.

### Evaluating Tallyfy during your trial

1. **Pick a real process** - Don't use hypothetical examples. Choose a workflow you run weekly.
2. **Set success criteria** - Define what "working" means: time saved? Errors reduced? Better visibility?
3. **Test with real users** - Include the people who'll actually use it, not just managers
4. **Measure improvements** - Track how long the process takes before and after Tallyfy
5. **Try key features** - Test automations, guest users, notifications, and integrations

**Questions to answer during your trial:**
- Can we build our critical processes? (Try your top 3)
- Will our team actually use it? (Get 3+ people to complete tasks)
- Does it integrate with our tools? (Test Zapier, API, or webhooks)
- Is the ROI clear? (Calculate hours saved per week)

:::tip[Trial success indicators]
You'll know Tallyfy fits if: team members ask "when can we add more processes?", you catch errors that usually slip through, or you stop asking "what's the status?" in meetings.
