- Focus on processes where consistency directly impacts quality or efficiency
- Choose workflows that demonstrate clear value to gain organizational buy-in

**Phase 2: Regulatory and Compliance-Critical Procedures**
- Implement workflows that directly impact regulatory compliance or audit readiness
- Include processes where standardization reduces risk or improves quality
- Focus on procedures that require extensive documentation or approval trails

**Phase 3: Complex, Multi-Department Workflows**
- Implement processes that span multiple departments or require extensive coordination
- Include workflows with complex conditional logic or numerous exception paths
- Focus on procedures that benefit most from real-time tracking and visibility

### Industry expertise integration
Successful implementations leverage existing industry knowledge:

**Subject Matter Expert Collaboration**:
- Work with internal experts to capture nuanced industry requirements
- Document not just procedures but reasoning and context behind decisions
- Include regulatory knowledge and compliance requirements in workflow design
- Plan for ongoing expert review and procedure refinement

**Regulatory and Standards Alignment**:
- Ensure workflows comply with industry-specific regulations and standards
- Include required documentation and approval steps for compliance purposes
- Design audit-ready processes with built-in evidence collection and reporting
