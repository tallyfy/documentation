## How to navigate the Tallyfy platform interface

Tallyfy workflow management uses several key interface areas to help you find information and manage workflow tasks effectively.

### What is the left sidebar menu in Tallyfy?

The left sidebar serves as your primary navigation tool in Tallyfy, located on the left side of the screen.

### How does Tallyfy's universal search work?

The universal search bar at the top allows you to find items across your entire Tallyfy account.

You can search for processes, templates, tasks, snippets, and team members by typing keywords.

*   **Sharing Search Results**: Click the share icon next to any Tallyfy search result to copy a direct link to that item
