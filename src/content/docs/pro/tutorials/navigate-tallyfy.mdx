## How to get around the Tallyfy interface

Tallyfy has several key interface areas for finding information and managing tasks.

### What's the left sidebar menu?

The left sidebar is your main navigation in Tallyfy.

### How does universal search work?

The search bar at the top lets you find anything across your Tallyfy account - processes, templates, tasks, snippets, and team members. Just type keywords.

*   **Sharing results**: Click the share icon next to any search result to copy a direct link to that item.

### What are the top bar icons?

*   **Language selector** (Globe icon): Click to change the display language for menus and buttons. If your organization uses the [Azure Translation integration](/products/pro/integrations/azure-translation/), you can also select a language for automatic content translation.

*   **Notifications** (Bell icon): Click to view recent notifications about task assignments, comments, and other activity. See [Check Notifications](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/how-can-i-view-notifications-in-tallyfy/).
