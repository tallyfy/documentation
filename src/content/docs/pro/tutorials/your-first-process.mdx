## Tutorial: Launch a process

In order to launch our first process, you need to create a [template](/products/pro/tutorials/your-first-template/). Once we have that. we can proceed to launch our first process.

1. First, go to the "Templates" section via the left navigation. You will see a "Launch" button right there next to the template. You can also click on the "pencil" icon to get to the template editor.

3. You'll be prompted to fill any **Kick-off form fields** you have configured. This includes any information required to initiate the process, such as a client's name and email. Learn more about [kick off form fields](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/)

4. Now, it's time to name your process. If you're unsure, you can click the **Generate** button to automatically generate a name for your process. Alternatively, select **Give me more ideas** to see some recommended naming conventions for processes.

5. Finally, you have the option to edit any step before launching your process. This includes assigning tasks, setting deadlines, or removing any unnecessary steps. If you need to edit multiple steps simultaneously, consider using **Power Tools** - which allows you to make changes in bulk.

6. That's it! You have launched your first process. Each assignee will receive an email notification about the tasks they need to complete. You can track the progress of the process in the **Tracker** view. To learn more about the Tracker view, click [here](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/how-can-i-manage-and-track-my-processes-on-tallyfy/)

:::tip[Customize with ad-hoc tasks]
Remember that you're not limited to just the tasks defined in your template! After launching a process, you can always add ad-hoc one-off tasks of any type (approval tasks, email tasks, etc.) to adapt the process to specific circumstances. Simply open your active process and use the **"Add task"** option at the bottom.
