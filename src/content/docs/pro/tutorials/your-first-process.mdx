## How to launch your first process

Here's how to launch a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) from a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) you've already created. A process is a running instance of your template - think of the template as a blueprint and the process as a live, trackable copy.

<Steps>
1.  **Go to Templates**: Click **Templates** in the left sidebar to see your templates.
2.  **Find your template**: Locate the template you want to launch.
3.  **Click Launch**: Click the **Launch Process** button on the template card.

4.  **Fill kick-off form (if applicable)**: If your template has a [kick-off form](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/), fill in the required starting information.
5.  **Name your process**: Give it a clear, unique name (e.g., "Onboarding - John Doe"). You can click **Generate** for automatic name suggestions.

6.  **(Optional) Review and edit**: Click **Review & Edit** to change assignees, deadlines, or remove optional steps before launching. See [Edit before launch](/products/pro/launching/how-can-i-edit-a-process-before-launching/) for details.

7.  **Launch!**: Click the final **Launch** button to start your process.
8.  **Track progress**: Your process is now active and assignees get automatic notifications. Monitor progress in the **[Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** view.

:::tip[Need to add tasks later?]
You can add [ad-hoc tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/edit-processes/how-can-i-add-tasks-to-active-processes-on-tallyfy/) to any running process - even if they weren't in the original template.
