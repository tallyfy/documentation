## Tutorial: Launching Your First Process

This tutorial guides you through launching a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) (starting a workflow) from a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) you've already created.

<Steps>
1.  **Go to Templates**: Click **Templates** in the left sidebar to view your template library.
2.  **Find Your Template**: Locate the template you want to launch.
3.  **Click Launch**: Click the **Launch Process** button on the template card.

4.  **Fill Kick-off Form (if any)**: If the template has a [kick-off form](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/), fill in the required starting information first.
5.  **Name Your Process**: Give this specific run of the process a clear, unique name (e.g., "Onboarding - John Doe"). You can use the **Generate** button for ideas based on Tallyfy's suggestions.

6.  **(Optional) Review & Edit**: Before the final launch, you can click **Review & Edit** to change assignees or deadlines for this specific run. You can even remove optional steps if needed. (See [Edit Before Launch](/products/pro/launching/how-can-i-edit-a-process-before-launching/)).

7.  **Launch!**: Click the final **Launch** button.
8.  **Track Progress**: The process is now active! Assignees will be notified. You can monitor its progress in the **[Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** view.

:::tip[Add Extra Tasks Later]
Need to add a step that wasn't in the template? You can add [ad-hoc tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/edit-processes/how-can-i-add-tasks-to-active-processes-on-tallyfy/) to any running process.
