## Tutorial: Launching your first process

This tutorial shows you how to launch a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) (start a workflow instance) from a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) you have already created.

<Steps>
1.  **Go to Templates**: Click **Templates** in the left sidebar menu to see your template library.
2.  **Find your template**: Locate the specific template you want to use.
3.  **Click Launch**: Select the **Launch Process** button on the template card.

4.  **Fill kick-off form (if applicable)**: If the template includes a [kick-off form](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/), complete the required starting information.
5.  **Name your process**: Give this specific instance of the process a clear, unique name (e.g., "Onboarding - John Doe"). You can use the **Generate** button for name suggestions.

6.  **(Optional) Review and edit**: Before the final launch, click **Review & Edit** to modify assignees, deadlines, or remove optional steps specifically for this instance. (See [Edit Before Launch](/products/pro/launching/how-can-i-edit-a-process-before-launching/)).

7.  **Launch!**: Click the final **Launch** button to start the process.
8.  **Track progress**: The process is now active, and assignees will be notified. Monitor its progress in the **[Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** view.

:::tip[Need to add tasks later?]
If you need to add a step that wasn't part of the original template, you can add [ad-hoc tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/edit-processes/how-can-i-add-tasks-to-active-processes-on-tallyfy/) to any running process.
