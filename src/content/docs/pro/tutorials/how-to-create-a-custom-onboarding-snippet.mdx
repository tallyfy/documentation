## How can I create a custom onboarding snippet in Tallyfy?

Tallyfy [Snippets](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/) enable organizations to create personalized welcome messages and instructional content for new team members. This feature streamlines the onboarding process and ensures consistent information delivery.

These customizable Tallyfy snippets enhance the onboarding experience by providing immediate access to essential information, training resources, and organizational guidelines during critical initial interactions with the platform. Strategic snippet placement improves user adoption and reduces initial confusion.

These special snippets can be configured in **Settings > Organization > Personalization** under two distinct options:

*   **MEMBERS - JUST JOINED**: This snippet appears **only the first time** a new [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) logs in after accepting their invite. This option is ideal for one-time welcome messages, links to training videos, or key onboarding documents that require immediate attention.
*   **MEMBERS - HOMEPAGE**: This snippet **always shows** on the Tallyfy homepage for *all* members in your organization. Use this persistent display for ongoing important announcements, links to company resources, or support information that requires continuous visibility.

### How do I set up a welcome snippet?

<Steps>
1.  **First, create the content as a Snippet**: Navigate to **Settings > Organization > Snippets**. Click **Create Snippet**. Enter a title (e.g., "New Hire Welcome Message") and add your desired text, images, or videos. Click **Save**.

2.  **Then, assign the Snippet**: Go to **Settings > Organization > Personalization**.
3.  Locate the setting for either **MEMBERS - JUST JOINED** (for the one-time message) or **MEMBERS - HOMEPAGE** (for the permanent message).
4.  From the dropdown menu, select the Snippet you created in Step 1.
