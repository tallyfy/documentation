## Tutorial: Creating welcome snippets for new members

You can use Tallyfy's [Snippets](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/) feature to display custom welcome messages or instructions to new team members.

These special snippets can be set in **Settings > Organization > Personalization** under two options:

*   **MEMBERS - JUST JOINED**: This snippet appears **only the first time** a new [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) logs in after accepting their invite. It's ideal for a one-time welcome message, links to training videos, or key onboarding documents.
*   **MEMBERS - HOMEPAGE**: This snippet **always shows** on the Tallyfy homepage for *all* members in your organization. Use this for ongoing important announcements, links to company resources, or support information.

### How to set up a welcome snippet

<Steps>
1.  **First, create the content as a Snippet**: Navigate to **Settings > Organization > Snippets**. Click **Create Snippet**. Enter a title (e.g., "New Hire Welcome Message") and add your desired text, images, or videos. Click **Save**.

2.  **Then, assign the Snippet**: Go to **Settings > Organization > Personalization**.
3.  Locate the setting for either **MEMBERS - JUST JOINED** (for the one-time message) or **MEMBERS - HOMEPAGE** (for the permanent message).
4.  From the dropdown menu, select the Snippet you created in Step 1.
