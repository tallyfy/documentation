## Tutorial: Creating Welcome Snippets for New Members

You can use Tallyfy's [Snippets](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/) feature to show special welcome messages or instructions to new team members when they first join, or permanently on everyone's homepage.

There are two places you can set these special snippets (in **Settings > Organization > Personalization**):

*   **MEMBERS - JUST JOINED**: This snippet shows up **only the very first time** a new [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) logs into Tallyfy after accepting their invitation. It's great for a one-time welcome message, links to initial training videos, or key onboarding documents.
*   **MEMBERS - HOMEPAGE**: This snippet **always appears** on the Tallyfy homepage for *all* members in your organization. Use this for important ongoing announcements, links to company resources, or support information.

### How to Set Up a Welcome Snippet

<Steps>
1.  **First, create the content as a Snippet**: Go to **Settings > Organization > Snippets**. Click **Create Snippet**. Give it a title (e.g., "New Hire Welcome Message") and add the text, images, or videos you want to display. Click **Save**.

2.  **Then, assign the Snippet**: Go to **Settings > Organization > Personalization**.
3.  Find the setting for either **MEMBERS - JUST JOINED** (for the one-time message) or **MEMBERS - HOMEPAGE** (for the permanent message).
4.  Click the dropdown menu and select the Snippet you created in Step 1.

</Steps>

Now, the selected snippet will appear in the chosen location for your members.
