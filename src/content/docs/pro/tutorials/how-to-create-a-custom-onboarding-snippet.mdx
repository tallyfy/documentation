## Tutorial: Get coworkers up to speed quickly

Create custom onboarding snippets to provide personalized welcome messages for new team members.

[Snippets](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/) enable you to create and assign personalized messages for new [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) joining Tallyfy.

There are two types of onboarding snippets:

* The _MEMBERS - JUST JOINED_ snippet is the content new members see temporarily before they first come into Tallyfy. This is ideal for initial content like demo videos or links to adoption guides.
* The _MEMBERS - HOMEPAGE_ snippet is a snippet that always displays on the homepage of your organization for all users.

You can either choose an existing snippet or create a new one.

To create a new onboarding snippet:

<Steps>
1. Go to Settings > Organization > Snippets to access the Snippets feature.

2. Click 'Create Snippet' and craft your custom message. Rich media content such as videos and images can be included.

3. Once you're done with your snippet, head over to Settings > Organization > Personalization, and then select the snippet you created in the **MEMBERS - JUST JOINED** option - which sets the _one-time_ snippet when members first join, for example:

4. When new members accept their invite and enter their account for the first time, the snippet will be displayed to them.
</Steps>

You can repeat the process if you like for the **MEMBERS - HOMEPAGE** snippet.

Remember, you can only choose one snippet to display in each scenario.
