## Tutorial: Creating welcome descriptions for new members

You can use Tallyfy's [descriptions](/products/pro/documenting/templates/descriptions/) feature to display custom welcome messages or instructions to new team members.

These special descriptions can be set in **Settings > Organization > Personalization** under two options:

*   **MEMBERS - JUST JOINED**: This description appears **only the first time** a new [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) logs in after accepting their invite. It's ideal for a one-time welcome message, links to training videos, or key onboarding documents.
*   **MEMBERS - HOMEPAGE**: This description **always shows** on the Tallyfy homepage for *all* members in your organization. Use this for ongoing important announcements, links to company resources, or support information.

### How to set up a welcome description

<Steps>
1.  **First, create the content as a description**: Navigate to **Settings > Organization > descriptions**. Click **Create description**. Enter a title (e.g., "New Hire Welcome Message") and add your desired text, images, or videos. Click **Save**.

2.  **Then, assign the description**: Go to **Settings > Organization > Personalization**.
3.  Locate the setting for either **MEMBERS - JUST JOINED** (for the one-time message) or **MEMBERS - HOMEPAGE** (for the permanent message).
4.  From the dropdown menu, select the description you created in Step 1.
