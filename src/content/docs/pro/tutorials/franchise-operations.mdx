## Using Tallyfy for franchise business models

Tallyfy turns scattered franchise SOPs - PDFs, spreadsheets, paper binders - into living workflows that franchisees actually run, not just read.

Here's the critical difference: franchisees don't just view procedures. They launch them as active [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) with real [task assignments](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), automated reminders, and completion tracking. A swim school with 200 locations can make sure every franchise follows the same pool cleaning protocol - and track that it actually happened.

## Two deployment models

### Model 1: distributed purchasing (recommended)

Each franchisee buys their own Tallyfy account. This gives them:
- Full control over templates and customization
- Independent billing and user management
- Ability to edit HQ-provided templates for local needs
- Private workspace (not visible to other franchisees)

**Why this matters**: Templates in free accounts become public - visible to anyone on the internet. Your proprietary franchise processes need paid accounts for security[^1].

### Model 2: centralized purchasing

HQ purchases and manages all franchisee accounts as one large organization. This provides:
- Single billing relationship
- Centralized user management
- Direct template distribution
- Unified reporting across all locations

Most franchises choose distributed purchasing because franchisees want autonomy over their operations and billing.

## Setting up your franchise system

### For franchise headquarters

<Steps>
1. Create your master Tallyfy organization account
2. Build standard operating [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) for all core processes
3. Test and refine templates with pilot franchisees
4. Export templates via [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) for distribution
5. Provide onboarding materials for franchisees
</Steps>

### For franchisees

<Steps>
1. Sign up for your own Tallyfy account (paid subscription required for privacy)
2. Import templates provided by HQ
3. Customize templates for local market needs
4. Assign team members and launch processes
5. Track performance and report outcomes
</Steps>

## Template sharing between organizations

Direct template copying between Tallyfy organizations currently requires an API-based approach:

1. HQ exports templates using the [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/)
2. HQ shares template data with franchisees (JSON format)
3. Franchisees import or recreate templates in their accounts
4. Each franchisee customizes for their specific needs

**Coming soon**: Direct template sharing between organizations is on the product roadmap.

Create a shared document library with step-by-step template documentation that franchisees can use with Tallyfy's [import feature](/products/pro/documenting/templates/import-feature/) to quickly rebuild templates.

## Why franchisees need paid accounts

Free Tallyfy accounts make all templates publicly searchable - anyone could find and view your proprietary franchise processes. Paid accounts give you:

- **Privacy**: Your competitive advantage stays confidential
- **Security**: Only authorized users access your workflows
- **Customization**: Full editing capabilities for local adaptation
- **Support**: Direct access to Tallyfy's support team
- **Capacity**: No limits on active processes or team members

Would you want competitors seeing exactly how you onboard customers or train staff? That's why each franchisee needs their own paid workspace.

## Beyond documentation - running live processes

Traditional franchise manuals sit on shelves. Tallyfy templates become active workflows:

- **Tasks auto-assign** to the right person based on [job titles](/products/pro/documenting/templates/edit-templates/understanding-assignment-types/)
- **AI automation** handles routine steps without human intervention
- **Deadlines track** automatically with escalation for overdue items
- **Forms collect** data consistently across all locations
- **Reports show** exactly which locations complete which processes

A restaurant franchise can confirm every location completed their daily opening checklist. A fitness franchise knows which clubs did equipment maintenance on schedule. The gap between reading an SOP and running it in Tallyfy directly impacts your margins.

## Free SSO for all franchise accounts

[Single Sign-On (SSO)](/products/pro/integrations/authentication/) comes free with every Tallyfy account - regardless of which deployment model you pick:

- HQ can use corporate identity providers (Azure AD, Okta, etc.)
- Each franchisee can set up their own SSO independently
- No additional SSO charges regardless of organization size

## Measuring franchise performance

Tallyfy gives franchise operations visibility into:
- Which locations consistently follow procedures
- Process completion times across different franchises
- Common bottlenecks or failure points
- Compliance rates for critical workflows
- Training effectiveness for new franchisees

The optional [Tallyfy Analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/) add-on provides custom dashboards comparing performance across your entire franchise network.

## Margin improvement through automation

Franchisees typically see margin improvements through:

1. **Reduced training time**: New employees follow guided workflows instead of shadowing for weeks
2. **Fewer errors**: Checklists and validations prevent costly mistakes
3. **Automated coordination**: Tasks flow between team members without manual handoffs
4. **Consistent quality**: Every customer gets the same experience
5. **Time savings**: Manual processes complete faster with automation

Consider a home services franchise: instead of calling to schedule follow-ups, [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) trigger based on job completion. Service techs focus on service, not admin.

## Getting started

### Quick pilot program

Start with 3-5 franchisees to:
1. Validate your template design
2. Gather feedback on customization needs
3. Measure actual time and cost savings
4. Build success stories for system-wide rollout

### Support resources

- **For HQ**: Work with Tallyfy's team to design your template distribution strategy
- **For franchisees**: Each account includes onboarding support and training resources
- **Ongoing help**: Contact the [support team](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/) for technical questions

### Investment and pricing

View current pricing at https://tallyfy.com/pricing/. Consider:
- Full Members (template creators) vs Light Members (task executors)
- Annual subscriptions save approximately 16%
- Volume discussions available for 50+ franchise locations
- Each franchisee's investment typically pays back within 60-90 days through efficiency gains

[^1]: Paid accounts ensure all templates and processes remain private to your organization only
