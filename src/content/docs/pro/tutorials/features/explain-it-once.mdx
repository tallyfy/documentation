## Explain It Once: The Power of Templates

The core idea behind Tallyfy [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) is "Explain it Once". You define your standard process one time in a template, and then everyone follows that same standard process every time it needs to be done. This ensures consistency and saves time.

Tallyfy offers several ways to create these templates and features to support them:

*   **AI-Assisted Creation**: Get help building templates using Tallyfy AI, especially if you don't have existing documentation.
*   **Document Conversion**: Upload existing Word docs, PDFs, or flowcharts, and Tallyfy AI will try to convert them into digital templates.
*   **Multilingual Support**: Translate template content automatically for global teams using the [Azure AI integration](/products/pro/integrations/azure-translation/).
*   **Works on Any Device**: Templates and processes automatically adjust to work well on desktops, tablets, and phones.
*   **Compliance Support**: Track who did what and when with audit trails, and control permissions to meet rules.
*   **Continuous Improvement**: Use the built-in comment features to gather feedback and easily update templates over time.
*   **Template Maintenance**: Set reminders or tasks to review and update templates regularly.
*   **Analytics Integration**: Connect to tools like Google [Analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/) to see how often templates are used.
*   **Conditional Logic**: Build smart templates with "if-then" rules ([Automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/)) that adapt to different situations.
