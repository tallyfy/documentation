## How does "Explain it Once" work with Tallyfy templates?

![Explain it once visualized as a single person speaking into a megaphone on the left with their message transforming into multiple identical template copies flowing to different team members on the right - representing standardized processes explained once and executed consistently](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/illustrations/explain-it-once.jpeg)

Tallyfy templates embody the powerful "Explain it Once" philosophy. This lets organizations define standard processes once and execute them consistently across all teams.

This Tallyfy approach makes sure your organization stays consistent while getting rid of repetitive process explanations. Teams follow identical standardized processes every time they're needed. This cuts down on training time and prevents workflow variations that can hurt quality and efficiency.
