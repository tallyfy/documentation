## How does "Explain it Once" work with Tallyfy templates?

Tallyfy [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) embody the powerful "Explain it Once" philosophy. This enables organizations to define standard processes once and execute them consistently across all teams.

This approach ensures organizational consistency while eliminating repetitive process explanations. Teams follow identical standardized processes every time they're needed. This reduces training time and prevents workflow variations that can compromise quality and efficiency.
