## Explain it once: The power of templates

The idea behind Tallyfy [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) is simple: "Explain it Once". You define your standard process just one time in a template. Then, everyone follows that same standard process every time it's needed. This ensures consistency and saves time explaining things repeatedly.

Tallyfy offers several ways to create templates and features to support them:

*   **AI-assisted creation**: Get help building templates using Tallyfy AI, especially if starting from scratch.
*   **Document conversion**: Upload existing Word docs, PDFs, or flowcharts, and Tallyfy AI will attempt to convert them into digital templates.
*   **Multilingual support**: Translate template content automatically for global teams using the [Azure AI integration](/products/pro/integrations/azure-translation/).
*   **Works on any device**: Templates and processes automatically adjust to look good and work well on desktops, tablets, and phones.
*   **Compliance support**: Track who did what and when with audit trails, and control permissions to meet regulations.
*   **Continuous improvement**: Use built-in comments to collect feedback and easily update templates.
*   **Template maintenance**: Set reminders or tasks for regularly reviewing and updating templates.
*   **Analytics integration**: Connect to tools like Google [Analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/) to track template usage.
*   **Conditional logic**: Build smart templates using "if-this-then-that" rules ([Automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/)) that adapt to different situations.
