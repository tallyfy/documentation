## How does "Explain it Once" work with Tallyfy templates?

![Explain it once visualized as a single person speaking into a megaphone on the left with their message transforming into multiple identical template copies flowing to different team members on the right - representing standardized processes explained once and executed consistently](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/illustrations/explain-it-once.jpeg)

Tallyfy templates embody the powerful "Explain it Once" philosophy. This lets organizations define standard processes once and execute them consistently across all teams.

This Tallyfy approach makes sure your organization stays consistent while getting rid of repetitive process explanations. Teams follow identical standardized processes every time they're needed. This cuts down on training time and prevents workflow variations that can hurt quality and efficiency.

*   **AI-assisted creation**: Get help building templates using Tallyfy AI, especially when you're starting from scratch.
*   **Document conversion**: Upload existing Word docs, PDFs, or flowcharts, and Tallyfy AI will try to convert them into digital templates.
*   **Multilingual support**: Translate template content automatically for global teams using the [Azure AI integration](/products/pro/integrations/azure-translation/). Organizations operating internationally should review [global workplace language requirements](/products/pro/integrations/azure-translation/global-workplace-language-requirements/) to ensure compliance with local regulations.
*   **Works on any device**: Templates and processes automatically adjust to look good and work well on desktops, tablets, and phones.

*   **Continuous improvement**: Use built-in comments to collect feedback and easily update templates.
*   **Template maintenance**: Set reminders or tasks for regularly reviewing and updating templates.
*   **Analytics integration**: Connect to tools like Google [Analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/) to track template usage.
*   **Conditional logic**: Build smart templates using "if-this-then-that" rules ([Automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/)) that adapt to different situations.
