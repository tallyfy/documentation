## How does "Explain it once" work with Tallyfy templates?

![Explain it once visualized as a single person speaking into a megaphone on the left with their message transforming into multiple identical template copies flowing to different team members on the right - representing standardized processes explained once and executed consistently](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/illustrations/explain-it-once.jpeg)

Tallyfy templates are built around the "Explain it Once" idea - you define a process once, then every team runs it the same way. There's no need to repeat yourself. Teams follow identical steps every time, which cuts training time and prevents the quality problems that come from everyone doing things differently.

### What template creation methods and features does Tallyfy offer?

Tallyfy provides several ways to create and manage templates:

<lite-vimeo videoid="903080351"></lite-vimeo>

*   **AI-assisted creation** - Build templates using Tallyfy AI, especially when you're starting from scratch.
*   **Document conversion** - Upload existing Word docs, PDFs, or flowcharts, and Tallyfy AI will try to convert them into digital templates.
*   **Multilingual support** - Translate template content automatically for global teams using the [Azure AI integration](/products/pro/integrations/azure-translation/). If you operate internationally, review [global workplace language requirements](/products/pro/integrations/azure-translation/global-workplace-language-requirements/) for compliance with local regulations.
*   **Works on any device** - Templates and processes automatically adjust to work well on desktops, tablets, and phones.
*   **Compliance support** - Track who did what and when with audit trails, and control permissions to meet regulations.
*   **Continuous improvement** - Use built-in comments to collect feedback and update templates over time.
*   **Template maintenance** - Set reminders for regularly reviewing and updating templates.
*   **Analytics integration** - Connect to tools like Google [Analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/) to track template usage.
*   **Conditional logic** - Build smart templates using "if-this-then-that" rules ([Automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/)) that adapt to different situations.
