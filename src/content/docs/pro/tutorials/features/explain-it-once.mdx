## How does "Explain it Once" work with Tallyfy templates?

Tallyfy templates embody the powerful "Explain it Once" philosophy. This lets organizations define standard processes once and execute them consistently across all teams.

This approach makes sure your organization stays consistent while getting rid of repetitive process explanations. Teams follow identical standardized processes every time they're needed. This cuts down on training time and prevents workflow variations that can hurt quality and efficiency.
