## Process Template Creation

Tallyfy provides multiple methods for creating standardized process [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). Users can either develop templates from scratch using AI assistance or convert existing documentation into digital process templates.

### AI-Assisted Template Creation

The platform includes AI capabilities that generate process templates based on user inputs. This feature assists users who need to develop new [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) without existing documentation.

### Document Digitization

Existing process documentation can be converted into executable digital templates. This functionality supports the migration from static documents to interactive workflows.

### Multilingual Support

The system offers real-time translation capabilities through Azure AI integration, supporting over 90 languages for global process standardization.

### Responsive Design

All templates automatically adapt to different screen sizes and devices, ensuring consistent usability across desktop and mobile interfaces.

### Compliance Features

The platform maintains audit trails and provides granular permission controls to support governance and [compliance](/products/pro/compliance/) requirements.

### Continuous Improvement Framework

A structured comment system allows process participants to suggest improvements, creating a feedback loop for ongoing process optimization.

### Template Maintenance

Scheduled review [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) can be configured to ensure templates remain current, with reminders for periodic updates.

### Analytics Integration

Usage metrics can be tracked through Google [Analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/) integration to measure template adoption and effectiveness.

### Conditional Logic

[Templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) can include if-then logic to create dynamic processes that adapt to different scenarios and requirements.
