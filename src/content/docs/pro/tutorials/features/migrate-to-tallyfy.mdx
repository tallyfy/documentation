## How do I migrate data from other platforms to Tallyfy?

You can move from many popular workflow and form tools into Tallyfy using our open-source migrator scripts. Start with a dry run, review the report, then run the full migration when you're ready. The code lives here: [Tallyfy Migrator on GitHub](https://github.com/tallyfy/migrator)<a href="https://github.com/tallyfy/migrator" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.

:::note[Important]
We provide these scripts as-is under the MIT license. Test with `--dry-run`, understand the caveats per vendor, and validate results before production use.

### What does the migrator do?

The migrator runs a five-phase flow that matches how data moves from a source vendor into Tallyfy:

- **Discovery**: Connects to the source, catalogs available data, and gathers counts.
- **Mapping**: Translates vendor concepts to Tallyfy concepts (for example, project → template, task → step/task, custom field → form field).
- **Transformation**: Converts structures to Tallyfy format and prepares users, fields, and metadata.
- **Migration**: Creates data in Tallyfy. Supports dry-run and checkpoint resume.
- **Validation**: Verifies integrity and outputs a report you can keep.

## How to run a migration (recommended path)

<Steps>
1. **Clone and install.**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tallyfy/migrator.git
   cd migrator
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables.**

   ```bash
   cp .env.template .env
   # Edit .env with: TALLYFY_API_KEY, TALLYFY_ORGANIZATION, and the source vendor's API keys
   ```

3. **Run a dry run first.**

   ```bash
   # Example: Asana
   cd asana/src
   python main.py --dry-run --verbose
   ```

4. **Review the report.** Confirm mappings, spot errors, and check rate-limiting notes. Adjust batch sizes or delays if needed.

5. **Run the actual migration.**

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

6. **Validate and spot-check.** Use the generated report and sample records in Tallyfy. If anything fails mid-way, use `--resume`.

7. *(Optional)* **Enable AI-assisted mapping.** Add `AI_ENABLED=true` and an AI API key in `.env` to improve field and structure mapping for complex vendors.

## Vendor-by-vendor notes and caveats

Each folder below links directly to the open-source code for that vendor, with a quick summary of scope and common considerations.

- **Asana**: [Folder](https://github.com/tallyfy/migrator/tree/main/asana)<a href="https://github.com/tallyfy/migrator/tree/main/asana" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
  - **Scope**: Projects, tasks/subtasks, sections, custom fields → map to Tallyfy templates, steps, and form fields.
  - **Caveats**: Dependencies and sections may flatten or translate into conditional steps. Tags often become metadata. Respect API rate limits.

- **Basecamp**: [Folder](https://github.com/tallyfy/migrator/tree/main/basecamp)<a href="https://github.com/tallyfy/migrator/tree/main/basecamp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
  - **Scope**: To-dos and lists → procedure templates and steps; message docs are typically referenced via links.
  - **Caveats**: Threads/comments are not 1:1 with Tallyfy task comments; attachments may be copied by URL.

- **ClickUp**: [Folder](https://github.com/tallyfy/migrator/tree/main/clickup)<a href="https://github.com/tallyfy/migrator/tree/main/clickup" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
  - **Scope**: Lists/folders/spaces, tasks, custom fields.

  - **Caveats**: Field validation and conditional logic translate to Tallyfy where possible; verify complex branching.

- **Google Forms**: [Folder](https://github.com/tallyfy/migrator/tree/main/google-forms)<a href="https://github.com/tallyfy/migrator/tree/main/google-forms" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
  - **Scope**: Questions and responses.
  - **Caveats**: Simple structure migrates well; logic jumps may require manual checks. Low complexity.

- **Jotform**: [Folder](https://github.com/tallyfy/migrator/tree/main/jotform)<a href="https://github.com/tallyfy/migrator/tree/main/jotform" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>[7]</sup></a>
  - **Scope**: Forms, fields, and submissions.
  - **Caveats**: Rich widgets may need custom mapping. Watch for attachment handling and rate limits.

- **Kissflow**: [Folder](https://github.com/tallyfy/migrator/tree/main/kissflow)<a href="https://github.com/tallyfy/migrator/tree/main/kissflow" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>[8]</sup></a>
  - **Scope**: Workflows and forms.
  - **Caveats**: Some constructs (like advanced states) may map to conditional steps or automations; review validation results carefully.

- **Monday.com**: [Folder](https://github.com/tallyfy/migrator/tree/main/monday)<a href="https://github.com/tallyfy/migrator/tree/main/monday" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>[9]</sup></a>
  - **Scope**: Boards, groups, items, column types.
  - **Caveats**: 30+ field types via GraphQL. Use AI for field mapping where possible. High complexity; test thoroughly.

- **Next Matter**: [Folder](https://github.com/tallyfy/migrator/tree/main/nextmatter)<a href="https://github.com/tallyfy/migrator/tree/main/nextmatter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>[10]</sup></a>
  - **Scope**: Processes and tasks.
  - **Caveats**: Step logic and automations may need manual review. Confirm user-role mapping.

- **Pipefy**: [Folder](https://github.com/tallyfy/migrator/tree/main/pipefy)<a href="https://github.com/tallyfy/migrator/tree/main/pipefy" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>[11]</sup></a>
  - **Scope**: Pipes, phases, fields.
  - **Caveats**: Paradigm shift from card/connection model to templates/steps. Use AI for workflow conversion. High complexity.

  - **Scope**: Boards, lists, cards → templates and steps.
  - **Caveats**: Checklists and labels map to steps/metadata. Butler automations require manual recreation.

- **Typeform**: [Folder](https://github.com/tallyfy/migrator/tree/main/typeform)<a href="https://github.com/tallyfy/migrator/tree/main/typeform" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>[15]</sup></a>
  - **Scope**: Forms and responses.
  - **Caveats**: Logic jumps translate where feasible. Low complexity overall.

- **Wrike**: [Folder](https://github.com/tallyfy/migrator/tree/main/wrike)<a href="https://github.com/tallyfy/migrator/tree/main/wrike" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>[16]</sup></a>
  - **Scope**: Projects/folders, tasks, custom fields.
  - **Caveats**: Folder/project distinctions flatten into template/process structure. Validate dependencies and custom field mappings.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+ and `pip` installed
- Tallyfy credentials: `TALLYFY_API_KEY` and `TALLYFY_ORGANIZATION`
- Source vendor API credentials
- Sufficient disk space for logs and reports

## Tips, validation, and troubleshooting

- **Always dry-run first.** Review the migration report. Fix obvious mapping gaps before moving on.
- **Mind rate limits.** Tune `MIGRATION_RATE_LIMIT_DELAY` and batch sizes for large datasets.
- **Use checkpoints.** For long runs, `--resume` saves time after transient failures.
- **AI assistance helps.** For complex vendors (Monday.com, Pipefy), enable AI mapping to improve field translations.
- **Verify outcomes.** Spot-check templates, steps, users, and sample processes in Tallyfy after migration.

## Where this lands in Tallyfy

Migrated structures typically become Tallyfy [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), then you [launch processes](/products/pro/launching/) you can track as live [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) with individual [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/). Use [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) to recreate conditional behavior from the source system.
