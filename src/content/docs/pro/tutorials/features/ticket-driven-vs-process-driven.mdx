title: Ticket-driven vs. process-driven workflows
---

## Ticket-driven workflow model

Ticket-driven workflows often work like separate conversations started in different ways:

* Email to a specific address
* A new social media conversation
* A phone call
* A chat message on a website or app

The typical ticket workflow looks like this:

1. **Managing the queue**: An incoming request waits to be processed.
2. **Initial check**: An agent decides if they can handle it or if it needs a specialist team.
3. **Gathering information**: Collecting more details if the initial info isn't enough.
4. **Solving the issue**: Responding and providing a solution to close the ticket.
5. **Optional check for root cause**: Looking into underlying problems that might need fixing in the product.
6. **Optional feature consideration**: Deciding if the issue suggests possible product improvements.
7. **Optional help docs update**: Checking if documentation needs updating based on the question.

This model often has several downsides:

* Steps 5-7 are often skipped.
* Customers can't easily see the ticket status or progress.
* Manual follow-up is needed if responses are slow.
* Service quality depends a lot on the individual agent handling the ticket.

## Process-driven workflow model

Process-driven workflows turn ticket handling into structured [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) with clear steps and accountability. Key features include:

* **Structured intake**: Using standard forms for initial request details and categorization.
* **Routing before review**: Automatically sending requests to the right teams based on type.
* **Using help docs automatically**: Applying knowledge base info systematically.
* **Involving other teams**: Clearly defining when other departments get involved.
* **Linking to improvement processes**: Connecting issues systematically to product improvement workflows.

## Advantages of process-driven workflows

* **Consistent steps**: Standard handling for all interactions.
* **Ensuring follow-up**: Automated reminders prevent missed steps.
* **Processes that can grow**: Clear ownership and next steps for easy scaling.
* **Clear progress tracking**: Visual status updates for everyone involved.
* **Customer visibility options**: Optionally showing process status to external people.
* **Regular improvement cycles**: Structured review of recurring issues for product improvement.
* **Improving help docs**: Systematically reviewing if help documentation is adequate.
