title: Ticket-driven vs. Process-driven workflows
---

## Ticket-Driven Workflow Model

Ticket-driven workflows function as independent communication threads initiated through various channels:

* Email to a designated address
* New conversation on a social platform
* Phone call
* Website or application chat message

The typical ticket-driven workflow follows this pattern:

1. **Queue management**: The incoming request enters an unread queue for processing
2. **Triage assessment**: An agent evaluates whether the request can be handled directly or requires specialized team involvement
3. **Information gathering**: Additional context collection if initial information is insufficient
4. **Issue resolution**: Providing response and solution to close the ticket
5. **Optional root cause analysis**: Investigating underlying issues that may require product improvements
6. **Optional feature consideration**: Evaluating if the issue indicates potential product enhancement needs
7. **Optional knowledge base update**: Reviewing whether documentation requires updates based on the query

This model often presents several limitations:

* Steps 5-7 frequently remain unaddressed
* Customers lack visibility into ticket status and progress
* Manual follow-up is required when responses are delayed
* Service quality depends heavily on individual agent decisions

## Process-Driven Workflow Model

Process-driven workflows transform ticket handling into structured processes with defined paths and accountability mechanisms. Key characteristics include:

* **Structured intake**: Using standardized forms for initial categorization
* **Pre-triage routing**: Direct routing to appropriate teams based on issue type
* **Automated knowledge integration**: Systematic application of knowledge base resources
* **Cross-functional engagement**: Defined involvement from relevant departments beyond support
* **Continuous improvement integration**: Systematic connection to product enhancement processes

## Comparative Advantages of Process-Driven Workflows

* **Procedural consistency**: Standard handling across all customer interactions
* **Follow-up assurance**: Automated reminders prevent overlooked steps
* **Scalable processes**: Clear ownership and next actions at each stage
* **Transparent progress tracking**: Visual status indicators for all stakeholders
* **Customer visibility options**: Selective process visibility for external participants
* **Systematic improvement cycles**: Structured evaluation of recurring issues for product enhancement
* **Documentation enhancement**: Systematic review of knowledge base adequacy
