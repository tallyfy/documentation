## How do ticket-driven workflows operate?

![Comparison of ticket-driven chaos versus process-driven clarity - left side shows tangled wires and scattered papers representing ad-hoc tickets, right side shows organized flowing pathways representing structured processes](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/illustrations/ticket-driven-vs-process-driven.jpeg)

Ticket-driven workflows work like separate conversations started through different channels:

* Email to a specific address for formal requests
* Social media for public inquiries
* Phone calls for urgent matters
* Chat messages on a website or app for quick help

:::warning[The shared inbox problem]
Shared inboxes have the same flaws as ticket systems - they're unstructured chaos pretending to be organization. Teams dump emails into a shared inbox hoping someone handles them, but you get:
- **No structured data**: Walls of text with information buried in email threads
- **No accountability**: "Someone" will handle it (but who? when?)
- **No visibility**: Is this being worked on? Who knows?
- **No consistency**: Each person handles requests their own way
- **No improvement**: Same problems repeat because there's no process to improve

Both tickets and shared inboxes are about opening and closing something with minimal structure. They're Band-Aids on broken processes.
:::

The typical ticket workflow follows this sequence:

1. **Managing the queue**: An incoming request waits to be processed in order.
2. **Initial check**: An agent decides if they can handle it or if it needs a specialist.
3. **Gathering information**: Collecting more details if the initial info isn't enough.
4. **Solving the issue**: Responding with a solution and closing the ticket.
5. **Optional root cause check**: Looking into underlying problems that might need fixing.
6. **Optional feature consideration**: Deciding if the issue suggests product improvements.
7. **Optional help docs update**: Checking if documentation needs updating.

This model has real downsides:

* Steps 5-7 are often skipped due to time constraints or lack of enforcement.
* Customers can't see ticket status or progress, creating uncertainty.
* Manual follow-up is needed if responses are slow.
* Service quality depends on whichever agent handles the ticket - creating inconsistency.

## How do process-driven workflows improve operations?

Tallyfy turns ticket handling into structured processes with clear steps and accountability. Here's what that looks like:

* **Structured intake**: Standard forms collect request details and categorization up front.
* **Routing before review**: Requests go to the right teams automatically based on type.
* **Using help docs automatically**: Knowledge base info gets applied consistently to responses.
* **Involving other teams**: Clear rules define when other departments get involved.
* **Linking to improvement processes**: Issues connect directly to product improvement workflows.

## What advantages do process-driven workflows have over tickets?

* **Consistent steps**: Every interaction gets the same standard handling.
* **Automatic follow-up**: Automated reminders prevent missed steps.
* **Processes that scale**: Clear ownership and next steps make it easy to grow.
* **Clear progress tracking**: Visual status updates keep everyone informed.
* **Customer visibility options**: You can optionally show process status to external people.
* **Regular improvement cycles**: Structured review of recurring issues drives product improvement.
* **Better help docs**: Systematic reviews catch gaps in self-service documentation.

:::tip[The power of structured funnels: before, during, and after]
Replacing tickets with structured processes builds a complete funnel that captures value at every stage:

**BEFORE (Structured intake)**:
- **Kick-off forms** collect exactly the data you need - no more, no less
- Required fields ensure critical information isn't missing
- Dropdown menus, date pickers, and validation prevent garbage data
- Conditional logic shows/hides fields based on previous answers
- File upload fields capture supporting documents upfront

**DURING (Structured execution)**:
- Every step has clear ownership and deadlines
- Automated routing based on form data (no manual triage)
- Parallel processing when multiple teams need to work simultaneously
- Form fields at each step capture structured progress data
- Comments stay attached to specific steps, not lost in email threads
- Real-time visibility shows exactly where things stand

**AFTER (Structured outcomes)**:
- Completion data feeds directly into analytics
- Structured output enables automatic downstream actions
- Performance metrics are captured automatically
- Process improvements are data-driven, not guesswork
- Knowledge base updates happen systematically
- Customer feedback links to specific process steps

**The bottom line**: Tickets and shared inboxes give you a mess of unstructured text. Tallyfy processes give you clean, structured data flowing through a predictable funnel. Which would you rather scale?

The result? More reliable, scalable, and customer-friendly support operations.
