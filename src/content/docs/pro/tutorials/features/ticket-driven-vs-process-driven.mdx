## How do ticket-driven workflow models operate?

Ticket-driven workflows often work like separate conversations started in different ways:

* Email to a specific address for formal requests
* A new social media conversation for public inquiries
* A phone call for urgent matters
* A chat message on a website or app for immediate assistance

:::warning[The shared inbox problem]
Shared inboxes suffer from the same fundamental flaws as ticket systems - they're unstructured chaos masquerading as organization. Teams dump emails into a shared inbox hoping someone will handle them, but what you get is:
- **No structured data**: Just walls of text with information buried in email threads
- **No accountability**: "Someone" will handle it (but who? when?)
- **No visibility**: Is this being worked on? Who knows?
- **No consistency**: Each person handles requests their own way
- **No improvement**: Same problems repeat because there's no process to optimize

Both tickets and shared inboxes are fundamentally about opening and closing something with minimal structure - they're Band-Aids on broken processes.
:::

The typical ticket workflow follows this sequence:

1. **Managing the queue**: An incoming request waits to be processed in order.
2. **Initial check**: An agent decides if they can handle it or if it needs a specialist team.
3. **Gathering information**: Collecting more details if the initial info isn't enough for resolution.
4. **Solving the issue**: Responding and providing a solution to close the ticket.
5. **Optional check for root cause**: Looking into underlying problems that might need fixing in the product.
6. **Optional feature consideration**: Deciding if the issue suggests possible product improvements.
7. **Optional help docs update**: Checking if documentation needs updating based on the question.

This model often has several operational downsides:

* Steps 5-7 are often skipped due to time constraints or lack of process enforcement.
* Customers can't easily see the ticket status or progress, creating uncertainty.
* Manual follow-up is needed if responses are slow, increasing administrative overhead.
* Service quality depends heavily on the individual agent handling the ticket, creating inconsistency.

## How do process-driven workflow models enhance operations?

Tallyfy process-driven workflows turn ticket handling into structured processes with clear steps and accountability. Key features include:

* **Structured intake**: Using standard forms for initial request details and categorization for consistency.
* **Routing before review**: Automatically sending requests to the right teams based on type for efficiency.
* **Using help docs automatically**: Applying knowledge base info systematically for consistent responses.
* **Involving other teams**: Clearly defining when other departments get involved for seamless collaboration.
* **Linking to improvement processes**: Connecting issues systematically to product improvement workflows for continuous enhancement.

This approach transforms reactive ticket handling into proactive workflow management.

## What advantages do process-driven workflows provide over ticket systems?

* **Consistent steps**: Standard handling for all interactions ensures uniform quality.
* **Ensuring follow-up**: Automated reminders prevent missed steps and maintain accountability.
* **Processes that can grow**: Clear ownership and next steps enable easy scaling as volume increases.
* **Clear progress tracking**: Visual status updates keep everyone involved informed of current state.
* **Customer visibility options**: Optionally showing process status to external people for transparency.
* **Regular improvement cycles**: Structured review of recurring issues drives systematic product improvement.
* **Improving help docs**: Systematically reviewing if help documentation is adequate for self-service.

:::tip[The power of structured funnels: Before, During, and After]
Replacing tickets with structured processes creates immense advantages by building a complete funnel that captures value at every stage:

**BEFORE (Structured Intake)**:
- **Kick-off forms** collect exactly the data you need - no more, no less
- Required fields ensure critical information isn't missing
- Dropdown menus, date pickers, and validation prevent garbage data
- Conditional logic shows/hides fields based on previous answers
- File upload fields capture supporting documents upfront

**DURING (Structured Execution)**:
- Every step has clear ownership and deadlines
- Automated routing based on form data (no manual triage)
- Parallel processing when multiple teams need to work simultaneously
- Form fields at each step capture structured progress data
- Comments stay attached to specific steps, not lost in email threads
- Real-time visibility shows exactly where things stand

**AFTER (Structured Outcomes)**:
- Completion data feeds directly into analytics
- Structured output enables automatic downstream actions
- Performance metrics are automatically captured
- Process improvements are data-driven, not guesswork
- Knowledge base updates happen systematically
- Customer feedback links to specific process steps

**The Bottom Line**: Tickets and shared inboxes give you a mess of unstructured text. Processes give you clean, structured data flowing through a predictable funnel. Which would you rather scale?

These advantages create more reliable, scalable, and customer-friendly support operations compared to traditional ticket-driven approaches.
