## How do if-this-then-that rules work in Tallyfy?

Tallyfy uses intuitive "If-this-then-that" rules, also known as Automations or conditional logic, to automate intelligent decisions and actions within your processes.

These Tallyfy automation rules enable dynamic workflow behavior that responds intelligently to changing conditions, user inputs, and process states. This gets rid of the need for manual intervention or complex programming knowledge.

### Why does Tallyfy use simple rules instead of flowcharts?

Complex flowcharts often confuse business users and process managers and are hard to maintain.

Tallyfy's clear if-this-then-that statements give you better usability and management capabilities. These stay accessible to all team members, even when handling sophisticated workflow scenarios that need multiple conditional branches.

### How accessible are Tallyfy's automation rules?

Tallyfy's automation interface doesn't need any programming expertise. This lets business users create sophisticated conditional logic through intuitive configuration options.

Users can easily set up complex business rules such as "IF the amount exceeds $500, THEN display the manager approval step" without technical knowledge or coding requirements.

### How can business teams manage their own rules?

Teams can often adjust their own workflow logic without needing IT help every time they need a change.

### How does Tallyfy connect to other tools?

While the rules are simple to create, they can trigger actions in other systems using Tallyfy's integration options like the API, Middleware, or Webhooks.

### What actions can if-this-then-that rules trigger?

These if-this-then-that rules can trigger various actions:

*   Change task assignments.
*   Adjust task deadlines.
*   Show or hide steps.
*   Re-open completed tasks.

### How can I convert existing flowcharts?

When you have existing flowcharts, Tallyfy offers tools (like AI import) to help turn them into runnable Tallyfy templates.
