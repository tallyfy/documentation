## "If This, Then That" Rules (Conditional Logic)

Tallyfy uses simple "If This, Then That" rules (also called [Automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) or conditional logic) to automate decisions and actions within your [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).

### Why Simple Rules Instead of Flowcharts?

Drawing complex flowcharts can be confusing and hard to update. Tallyfy's approach uses clear IF/THEN statements that are easier for everyone to understand and manage, while still handling complex situations.

### Easy for Anyone to Use

You don't need to be a programmer or process expert to create these rules. The Tallyfy interface makes it straightforward for business users to set up logic like "IF the amount is over $500, THEN show the manager approval step."

### Business Teams Can Manage Their Own Rules

This means teams can often adjust their own workflow logic without needing help from IT every time something needs to change.

### Connects to Other Tools

While the rules are simple to create, they can connect to other systems using Tallyfy's [integration](/products/pro/integrations/) options like the [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/), [Middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/), or [Webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/).

### More Than Just Showing/Hiding Steps

These IF/THEN rules can trigger different types of actions:

*   Change who a task is assigned to.
*   Adjust task deadlines.
*   Show or hide steps.
*   Re-open a completed task.

### Convert Existing Flowcharts

If you already have flowcharts, Tallyfy offers tools (like AI import) to help convert them into Tallyfy [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), turning your diagrams into runnable processes.
