## "If-this-then-that" rules (conditional logic)

Tallyfy uses simple "If-this-then-that" rules, also called [Automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) or conditional logic, to automate decisions and actions within your [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).

### Why simple rules instead of flowcharts?

Complex flowcharts can be confusing and hard to update. Tallyfy uses clear if-this-then-that statements that are easier for everyone to understand and manage, even for complex situations.

### Easy for anyone to use

You don't need to be a programmer to create these rules. Tallyfy's interface lets business users easily set up logic like "IF the amount is over $500, THEN show the manager approval step."

### Business teams can manage their own rules

Teams can often adjust their own workflow logic without needing IT help every time a change is needed.

### Connects to other tools

While the rules are simple to create, they can trigger actions in other systems using Tallyfy's [integration](/products/pro/integrations/) options like the [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/), [Middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/), or [Webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/).

### More than just showing/hiding steps

These if-this-then-that rules can trigger various actions:

*   Change task assignments.
*   Adjust task deadlines.
*   Show or hide steps.
*   Re-open completed tasks.

### Convert existing flowcharts

If you have existing flowcharts, Tallyfy offers tools (like AI import) to help turn them into runnable Tallyfy [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).
