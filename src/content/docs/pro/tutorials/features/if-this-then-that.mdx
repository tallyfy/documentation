## How do if-this-then-that rules work in Tallyfy?

Tallyfy employs intuitive "If-this-then-that" rules, also known as [Automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) or conditional logic, to automate intelligent decisions and actions within your [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).

These automation rules enable dynamic workflow behavior that responds intelligently to changing conditions, user inputs, and process states. This eliminates the need for manual intervention or complex programming knowledge.

### Why does Tallyfy use simple rules instead of flowcharts?

Complex flowcharts often create confusion and maintenance difficulties for business users and process managers.

Tallyfy's clear if-this-then-that statements provide superior usability and management capabilities. These remain accessible to all team members, even when handling sophisticated workflow scenarios requiring multiple conditional branches.

### How accessible are Tallyfy's automation rules?

Tallyfy's automation interface requires no programming expertise. This enables business users to create sophisticated conditional logic through intuitive configuration options.

Users can easily establish complex business rules such as "IF the amount exceeds $500, THEN display the manager approval step" without technical knowledge or coding requirements.

### How can business teams manage their own rules?

Teams can often adjust their own workflow logic without needing IT help every time a change is needed.

### How does Tallyfy connect to other tools?

While the rules are simple to create, they can trigger actions in other systems using Tallyfy's [integration](/products/pro/integrations/) options like the [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/), [Middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/), or [Webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/).

### What actions can if-this-then-that rules trigger?

These if-this-then-that rules can trigger various actions:

*   Change task assignments.
*   Adjust task deadlines.
*   Show or hide steps.
*   Re-open completed tasks.

### How can I convert existing flowcharts?

When you have existing flowcharts, Tallyfy offers tools (like AI import) to help turn them into runnable Tallyfy [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).
