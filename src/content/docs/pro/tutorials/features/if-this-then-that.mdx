## How do if-this-then-that rules work in Tallyfy?

Tallyfy uses "if-this-then-that" rules (also called automations) to make decisions and trigger actions in your processes automatically. Your workflows respond to changing conditions, user inputs, and process states - without manual intervention or coding.

### Why simple rules instead of flowcharts?

Complex flowcharts confuse business users and are hard to maintain. Tallyfy's clear if-this-then-that statements are easier to read, manage, and stay accessible to all team members - even for sophisticated scenarios with multiple conditional branches.

### Do I need programming skills?

No. You don't need any programming expertise. You can set up rules like "IF the amount exceeds $500, THEN show the manager approval step" through a simple configuration screen.

### Can teams manage their own rules?

Yes - teams can adjust their own workflow logic without needing IT help every time something changes.

### How does this connect to other tools?

While rules are simple to create, they can trigger actions in other systems using Tallyfy's API, Middleware, or Webhooks.

### What actions can rules trigger?

- Change task assignments
- Adjust task deadlines
- Show or hide steps
- Re-open completed tasks

### How can I convert existing flowcharts?

If you have existing flowcharts, Tallyfy's AI import tool can help turn them into runnable templates.
