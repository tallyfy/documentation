## Conditional Logic for Process Automation

Tallyfy implements conditional logic for [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) automation without using traditional flowcharts. This approach enables practical workflow [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) with precise control over [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) routing, assignments, deadlines, and visibility.

:::warning[Limitations of Traditional Flowcharts]
Traditional flowcharts can become difficult to manage in complex business scenarios. They often present challenges in direct execution and become unwieldy as decision paths increase. Tallyfy's conditional logic approach provides the same decision-making capabilities with improved usability.

### Accessible Automation Design

The platform is designed for users without technical backgrounds. The interface allows business teams to create and modify automations without requiring programming or process modeling expertise.

### Business-Managed Workflows

Department managers and business users can implement and modify conditional rules directly, reducing dependence on IT or consulting resources for workflow adjustments.

### Integration Capabilities

The system offers [integration](/products/pro/integrations/) options through:
- [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) access
- [Middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) connectors 
- Business intelligence data feeds
- [Webhook](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) functionality

### No-Code Implementation

The system does not require knowledge of Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) or other technical modeling languages, making it more accessible to general business users.

### Advanced Action Types

The conditional system extends beyond standard flow control to include multiple action types:

* Conditional reassignment of [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/)
* Dynamic deadline adjustments
* Visibility controls based on conditions
* Status changes triggered by [form](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) values

### Flowchart Conversion

Existing flowchart diagrams can be converted to Tallyfy [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) through specialized conversion tools. This enables migration from static diagrams to executable processes without manual recreation.
