## Stop cloning docs: Use fill-in-the-blanks templates

Instead of copying old documents (like contracts) and manually changing details, Tallyfy lets you create smart **[Document Templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/)**.

### Set what people can change

With a document template, you define the standard text that *shouldn't* change. Then, add specific editable [fields (blanks)](/products/pro/documenting/documents/how-can-i-add-editable-fields-to-my-tallyfy-documents/) where users enter custom information (like a client name or date).

When someone uses the document template, they just fill in the defined blanks. The rest stays consistent.

### Reuse standard text blocks (snippets)

If you have standard paragraphs (like legal text or company info) used in many documents, create a **[Snippet](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/)** with that text.

You can insert that snippet into multiple document templates. If the standard text changes, edit the snippet *once*, and the update automatically appears everywhere it's used.

### Pull in data automatically (variables)

If you collected information earlier in a process (like a customer name), use **[_Variables_](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/)** to insert that data automatically into your document template.

This means data is entered only once but can appear in multiple places, reducing errors and saving time (great for contracts).
