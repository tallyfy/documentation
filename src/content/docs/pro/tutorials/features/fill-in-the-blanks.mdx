## How can I stop cloning docs and use fill-in-the-blanks templates?

Instead of copying old documents (like contracts) and manually changing details, Tallyfy lets you create smart **[Document Templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/)**.

### How can I set what people can change?

With a document template, you define the standard text that *shouldn't* change. Then, add specific editable [fields (blanks)](/products/pro/documenting/documents/how-can-i-add-editable-fields-to-my-tallyfy-documents/) where users enter custom information (like a client name or date).

When someone uses the document template, they fill in the defined blanks. The rest stays consistent across all documents.

### How can I reuse standard text blocks with snippets?

When you have standard paragraphs (like legal text or company info) used in many documents, create a [**Snippet**](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/) with that text.

You can insert that snippet into multiple document templates. When the standard text changes, edit the snippet *once*, and the update automatically appears everywhere it's used.

### How can I pull in data automatically using variables?

When you collected information earlier in a process (like a customer name), use [**_Variables_**](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/) to insert that data automatically into your document template.

This means data is entered only once but can appear in multiple places. This reduces errors and saves time (especially great for contracts).
