## Stop cloning documents to make your own version

Digitize any contract, document, letter or playbook into a fill-in-the-blanks template.

### Set what's editable and what's read-only

Tallyfy's [document templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) let you set read-only content (by default) on a template and fields (either new ones or re-used ones) within the template as well. To use a template, just launch it - fill in the blanks and that's your version.

### Re-use snippets of content

Do you have a block of content that's used again and again, across all your documents? Make a snippet of it once, and then just "include" it by reference into your document template.

Every time you edit the master [snippet](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/) - it goes live _everywhere_ it's referenced. This enables consistent updates across all templates containing the snippet.

### Use existing fields

Have you already collected data from a field (like say - "First Name") within this template? Then use [_variables_](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/) to drop in the value of existing fields throughout your template.

This means you only enter data once, and it can be displayed multiple times throughout the template. This is useful for documents like legal contracts.
