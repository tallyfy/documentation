## Stop Cloning Docs: Use Fill-in-the-Blanks Templates

Instead of copying and pasting old documents (like contracts or letters) and manually changing specific details each time, Tallyfy lets you create smart **[Document Templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/)**.

### Set What People Can Change

With a document template, you define the standard text that *shouldn't* change (read-only). Then, you add specific editable [fields (blanks)](/products/pro/documenting/documents/how-can-i-add-editable-fields-to-my-tallyfy-documents/) where users need to enter custom information (like a client name or date).

When someone launches the document template, they just fill in the defined blanks. The rest of the document stays consistent and correct.

### Reuse Standard Text Blocks (Snippets)

Do you have paragraphs (like legal disclaimers or company info) that appear in many different documents? Create a **[Snippet](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/)** containing that text.

You can then insert that snippet into multiple document templates. If the standard text ever needs updating, you just edit the snippet *once*, and the change automatically appears in all the templates using it.

### Pull in Data Automatically (Variables)

If you've already collected information earlier in a process (like a customer's name in a kick-off form), you can use **[_Variables_](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/)** to automatically insert that information into your document template.

This means data only needs to be entered once, and it can appear in multiple places within the document, reducing errors and saving time (especially useful for things like contracts).
