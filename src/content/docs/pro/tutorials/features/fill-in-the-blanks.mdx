## How can I stop cloning docs and use fill-in-the-blanks templates?

Instead of copying old documents (like contracts) and manually changing details, Tallyfy lets you create smart **[Document Templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/)**.

### How can I set what people can change?

You define the standard text that *shouldn't* change, then add specific editable [fields (blanks)](/products/pro/documenting/documents/how-can-i-add-editable-fields-to-my-tallyfy-documents/) where users enter custom information (like a client name or date). When someone uses the template, they fill in those blanks - everything else stays consistent.

### How can I reuse standard text blocks with snippets?

If you have standard paragraphs (like legal text or company info) used across many documents, create a [**Snippet**](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/) with that text. Insert it into multiple document templates - and when the text changes, edit the snippet *once*. The update appears everywhere it's used.

### How can I pull in data automatically using variables?

When you've collected information earlier in a process (like a customer name), use [**_Variables_**](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/) to insert that data automatically into your document template. Data gets entered once but can appear in multiple places - reducing errors and saving time, especially for contracts.
