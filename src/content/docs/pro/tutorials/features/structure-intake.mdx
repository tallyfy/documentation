## Integrated form and process management

Tallyfy connects [forms](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) with the later workflow [steps](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), creating visibility and accountability through the whole sequence from submission to completion. This turns separate form submissions into the first step of a structured, trackable process.

### Form-to-process integration

The platform connects intake forms directly to later steps by:
- Placing kick-off forms at the start of process [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).
- Automatically starting defined workflows when a form is submitted.
- Tracking progress through all following steps.
- Making the entire process visible to relevant people.
- Including external participants using [guest access](/products/pro/documenting/guests/).

As a complete [work intake software](https://tallyfy.com/solutions/work-intake-software/), Tallyfy ensures all incoming requests are captured, routed, and tracked properly from start to finish.

### Visibility throughout the process lifecycle

Unlike separate forms where visibility stops after submission, Tallyfy provides ongoing status tracking for everyone involved (internal and external). This eliminates the need for manual follow-ups about submission status.

### Data continuity

Information collected in kick-off forms is available throughout the process:
- [Form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) data flows automatically to later steps.
- [Variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/) can pull form field values into later steps.
- [Webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) can send form data to other systems.
- All submitted info remains accessible to authorized people.

### Submission verification

The system has validation features that help ensure real submissions:
- Email verification for external guests.
- Secure access control through verified email links.
- Options for public access forms when needed.

### Form migration options

You can migrate existing forms (web forms, Word/Excel/PDF docs, paper forms) into Tallyfy, using available conversion tools to help with the migration.
