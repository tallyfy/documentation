## Integrated Form and Process Management

Tallyfy integrates forms with subsequent workflow processes, creating visibility and accountability throughout the entire sequence from initial submission to completion. This approach transforms standalone form submissions into the first step of a structured, trackable process.

### Form-to-Process Integration

The platform connects intake forms directly to downstream processes by:
- Placing kick-off forms at the beginning of process templates
- Automatically initiating defined workflows upon form submission
- Tracking progress through all subsequent steps
- Making the entire process visible to relevant stakeholders
- Including external participants through guest access capabilities

### Visibility Throughout the Process Lifecycle

Unlike standalone forms where visibility ends after submission, the integrated approach provides continuous status tracking for both internal and external participants. This eliminates the need for manual follow-up inquiries about submission status.

### Data Continuity

Information collected through kick-off forms remains accessible throughout the process:
- Form field data flows automatically to subsequent steps
- Variables can reference form field values in later stages
- Webhook functionality can transmit form data to external systems
- All submitted information remains accessible to authorized participants

### Submission Verification

The system includes validation capabilities that help ensure authentic submissions:
- Email verification for external participants
- Access control through verified email links
- Options for public access forms when appropriate

### Form Migration Options

Existing forms from various formats can be migrated to the integrated system:
- Web forms
- Document-based forms (Word, Excel, PDF)
- Paper forms
- Conversion tools to facilitate migration
