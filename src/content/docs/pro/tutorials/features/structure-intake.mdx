## How does integrated form and process management work?

Tallyfy connects [forms](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) directly to later workflow [steps](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), turning separate form submissions into the first step of a structured, trackable process. You'll get full visibility and accountability from submission to completion.

### How does form-to-process integration work?

Tallyfy connects intake forms directly to later steps by:
- Placing kick-off forms at the start of process [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).
- Automatically starting defined workflows when a form is submitted.
- Tracking progress through all following steps.
- Making the entire process visible to relevant people.
- Including external participants using [guest access](/products/pro/documenting/guests/).

As [work intake software](https://tallyfy.com/solutions/work-intake-software/), Tallyfy ensures all incoming requests are captured, routed, and tracked from start to finish.

### How does Tallyfy provide visibility throughout the process lifecycle?

With standalone forms, visibility stops after submission. Tallyfy provides ongoing status tracking for everyone involved - both internal and external - so there's no need for manual follow-ups about submission status.

### How does data continuity work throughout processes?

Information collected in kick-off forms stays available throughout the process:
- [Form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) data flows automatically to later steps.
- [Variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/) can pull form field values into later steps.
- [Webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) can send form data to other systems.
- All submitted info remains accessible to authorized people.

### How does submission verification work?

Tallyfy includes validation features to help ensure real submissions:
- Email verification for external guests.
- Secure access control through verified email links.
- Options for public access forms when needed.

### What form migration options are available?

You can migrate existing forms - whether they're web forms, Word/Excel/PDF docs, or paper forms - into Tallyfy. Conversion tools are available to help with the migration.
