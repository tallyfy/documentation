## Seeing process status in real time

Tallyfy automatically shows the live status of your running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). This means less time asking people for updates or attending status meetings.

### Automatic progress tracking

When people complete [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), Tallyfy instantly updates the process status. You can easily see what's done, what's in progress, and what's next â€“ without needing manual updates via email or chat.

### Automatic notifications

When a task is ready for someone, Tallyfy automatically notifies them (by email or in-app) that it's their turn. This keeps work moving without manual follow-ups.

### Easier analysis and improvement

Because Tallyfy uses standard [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), tracking how long processes and steps take is much more consistent than using emails or spreadsheets. This consistency helps you:

*   Compare different runs of the same process.
*   Spot bottlenecks or steps causing delays.
*   Measure if changes actually improve the process.
*   Make better decisions using real data.

### More predictable results

Using documented, trackable processes in Tallyfy leads to more consistent outcomes compared to managing work through scattered emails or simple to-do lists.
