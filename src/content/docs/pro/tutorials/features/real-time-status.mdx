### The future is predictable operations

Projects are never predictable. Processes give you predictable outcomes.

### Purpose built

The features you need to document and run processes are unique. Process thinking is amazing. Tallyfy takes proven methods and packages them in any easy wrapper that anyone can use.

### Analyzable and comparable

Compare and analyze hundreds of processes like-for-like.

You can never do that with hundreds of ad-hoc projects - because projects are not comparable apples-to-apples.

### Proven via solid research for decades
