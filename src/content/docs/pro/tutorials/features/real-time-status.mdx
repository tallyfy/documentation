## Seeing Process Status in Real Time

Tallyfy automatically shows you the real-time status of your running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). This means less time spent asking for updates or sitting in status meetings.

### Automatic Progress Tracking

As people complete [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), Tallyfy instantly updates the process status. You can easily see what's finished, what's currently being worked on, and what's coming up next â€“ no need for manual email updates.

### Automatic Notifications

When a task becomes ready for someone, Tallyfy automatically notifies them (via email or in-app notification) that it's their turn. This keeps the process moving without manual follow-ups.

### Easier Analysis and Improvement

Because Tallyfy uses standard [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), you can track how long processes and steps take much more consistently than with emails or spreadsheets. This helps you:

*   Compare how different runs of the same process perform.
*   Spot bottlenecks or steps that consistently cause delays.
*   Measure if changes you make actually improve the process.
*   Make better decisions based on real data.

### More Predictable Results

Using documented, trackable processes in Tallyfy leads to more consistent and predictable results compared to managing work through scattered emails or basic to-do lists.
