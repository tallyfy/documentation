## How can I work with external guests in Tallyfy?

Tallyfy's **Guest** feature lets external people - customers, clients, vendors, partners - participate in your workflows without creating an account or managing passwords.

### What features does Tallyfy provide for guest collaboration?

*   **No login needed** - Guests access their assigned [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) through a unique, secure link sent via email. No account or password required.
*   **One link per person** - Each guest email (e.g. jane.doe@gmail.com) maps to one specific link that never changes. They can access all tasks assigned to their email via this single link (after verifying their email the first time).
*   **Your branding** - Guests see your company logo and colors for a professional look.
*   **Guests can reassign** - A guest can pass their task to someone else on their team by adding the new person's email.
*   **Unlimited and free** - Invite as many guests as you need at no extra cost.
*   **Automatic reminders** - Guests get email reminders for upcoming or overdue tasks, and they can adjust the reminder frequency.
