### No signup and no login

Our studies and peer studies show that the biggest obstacle to getting a busy person to provide you information or complete a task is ridiculously simple - it's asking them to sign up and remember "yet another password". Tallyfy eliminates this requirement.

### One link forever

No matter how many tasks you assign to the same guest email address - the link stays the same. No more forgetting, questions or admin hurdles.

### Your brand

Guests see your branding and your logo, on emails too.

### Self-driven delegation

Your customer sometimes needs to assign tasks to other people within _their_ team. They can do that without any admin, via self-driven delegation of tasks to any other email address.

### Unlimited, free guests

Guests are people (email addresses) outside your company. With Tallyfy, you get unlimited free guests.

### Automated, controllable reminders

Guests receive email reminders about their tasks automatically, just like regular members. Important points about the reminder system:

- All guests automatically receive email reminders for incomplete or upcoming tasks
- Guests can select which specific days of the week they want to receive their task digest
- While frequency can be customized, reminders cannot be turned off completely - the minimum setting is one day per week
- You can also manually send ad-hoc reminders to guests at any time if urgent attention is needed on a task

This automated reminder system ensures tasks don't fall through the cracks, while still giving guests control over when they receive communications.

## Testimonial

Sol8 is a fast-growing agency. They're an official Google Partner. This is a quote from their story:

> Our clients and team sail through the Tallyfy process – there is no need for clients to log in, there is one link for everything they need to do, everything saves in real-time – it all works incredibly well! I simply can't imagine scaling our Google Ads agency without Tallyfy.
