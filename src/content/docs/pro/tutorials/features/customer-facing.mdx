## Working with External Guests (Customers, Partners, etc.)

Tallyfy makes it easy to involve people outside your company (like customers, clients, vendors, or partners) in your workflows using the **Guest** feature. Guests don't need a Tallyfy account or password.

### Key Features for Guests

*   **No Login Needed**: Guests access their specific assigned [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) through a unique, secure link sent to their email. They don't need to create an account or remember a password.
*   **One Link Per Person**: Each guest gets one main link (`go.tallyfy.com`). If they are assigned multiple tasks over time, they can access all their tasks via this single link (after verifying their email).
*   **Your Branding**: Guests see your company's logo and colors when they view tasks, providing a professional experience.
*   **Guests Can Reassign**: If needed, a guest can pass their assigned task to someone else on their team (by adding the new person's email as an assignee).
*   **Unlimited & Free**: You can invite as many guests as you need at no extra cost.
*   **Automatic Reminders**: Guests receive automatic email reminders for tasks that are due soon or overdue, helping keep things on track. They can adjust the frequency of these reminders.

Using the guest system allows smooth collaboration with external parties on specific tasks without giving them full access to your Tallyfy account.
