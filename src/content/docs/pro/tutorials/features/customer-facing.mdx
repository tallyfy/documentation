## Working with external guests (customers, partners, etc.)

Tallyfy lets you easily involve people outside your company (like customers, clients, vendors, or partners) in your workflows using the **Guest** feature. Guests don't need a Tallyfy account or password to participate.

### Key features for guests

*   **No login needed**: Guests access their assigned [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) through a unique, secure link sent via email. No account creation or password required.
*   **One link per person**: Each guest gets one primary link (`go.tallyfy.com`). They can access all tasks assigned to their email address via this single link (after verifying their email the first time).
*   **Your branding**: Guests see your company logo and colors for a professional look.
*   **Guests can reassign**: If needed, a guest can pass their task to someone else on their team by adding the new person's email.
*   **Unlimited & Free**: Invite as many guests as needed at no extra cost.
*   **Automatic reminders**: Guests get automatic email reminders for upcoming or overdue tasks. They can adjust the reminder frequency.

Using guests allows smooth collaboration with external people on specific tasks without granting them full access to your Tallyfy organization.
