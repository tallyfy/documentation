## How can I work with external guests in Tallyfy?

Tallyfy's **Guest** feature enables seamless external stakeholder participation in workflows without requiring account creation or password management.

This capability allows easy involvement of customers, clients, vendors, partners, and other external collaborators in your Tallyfy business processes. The system maintains security while simplifying access for non-internal users.

### What key features does Tallyfy provide for guest collaboration?

*   **No login needed**: Guests access their assigned [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) through a unique, secure link sent via email. No account creation or password required.
*   **One link per person**: Each guest email (e.g. jane.doe@gmail.com) maps to one specific link that never changes. They can access all tasks assigned to their email address via this single link (after verifying their email the first time).
*   **Your branding**: Guests see your company logo and colors for a professional look.
*   **Guests can reassign**: When needed, a guest can pass their task to someone else on their team by adding the new person's email.
*   **Unlimited & Free**: Invite as many guests as needed at no extra cost.
*   **Automatic reminders**: Guests receive automatic email reminders for upcoming or overdue tasks. They can adjust the reminder frequency.

Using guests allows smooth collaboration with external people on specific tasks without granting them full access to your Tallyfy organization.
