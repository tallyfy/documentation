### No Account Registration Required

External users can access their assigned tasks without creating accounts or remembering passwords, reducing barriers to participation in workflows.

### Persistent Link System

All tasks assigned to the same guest email address share a single persistent link, eliminating the need to manage multiple access credentials.

### Branding Consistency

Guests see your organization's branding and logo throughout their experience, including in system-generated emails.

### Task Delegation

External users can reassign tasks to other members of their team without requiring administrator intervention.

### Unlimited Guest Access

The platform allows unlimited external guest users at no additional cost.

### Reminder System

The reminder system for external users includes:

- Automatic email notifications for incomplete or upcoming tasks
- Customizable weekly reminder schedule based on user preferences
- Minimum frequency of one reminder per week
- Manual reminder capabilities for urgent tasks

This system helps maintain workflow momentum while allowing guests to control their notification frequency.
