## Using Tallyfy for knowledge management

Not every procedure needs tracking. Knowledge-only mode lets you publish procedures as reference materials that teams can access without launching formal processes - like entering a sales order or handling customer calls.

### When to use knowledge-only mode

Some processes need tracking (client onboarding, compliance audits). Others just need to be accessible and current.

**Good fit for knowledge-only mode:**
- Sales order entry steps
- Do's and don'ts for customer calls
- Equipment operating instructions
- Software how-to guides
- Company policies and guidelines
- Emergency response procedures
- Quick reference checklists

### Publishing procedures as knowledge

<Steps>
1. **Create your procedure template** - Document the process like any other template
2. **Mark as "Reference Only"** - Add a tag or folder designation for knowledge articles
3. **Set permissions** - Allow view access without launch permissions
4. **Publish internally** - Team members can search and view without starting processes
</Steps>

Your team searches for "sales order entry" and immediately finds the latest procedure. No hunting through outdated wikis or shared drives.

### Permissions for knowledge sharing

**View-only access** - Grant [Light members](/products/pro/documenting/members/light-members/) permission to view templates without launching them. Great for contractors or new hires who need reference materials but shouldn't start processes.

**Department-specific knowledge** - Use [folders](/products/pro/documenting/templates/organize-templates-into-folders/) to organize procedures by department. Sales sees sales procedures. Operations sees operations procedures.

**Guest access for partners** - Share specific procedures with [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) - like suppliers who need to understand your receiving process. They see only what you share.

### Improving knowledge through comments

Every procedure template includes a comment section. When someone spots an outdated step or has a better method, they comment directly on the template. Process owners get notified right away.

Example: A warehouse worker notices the receiving procedure references an old dock door number. They comment: "Step 3 should reference Dock 4, not Dock 2." The template owner updates it immediately. Everyone sees the correct information from that point on.

### Search capabilities

Tallyfy's [universal search](/products/pro/miscellaneous/how-to-use-tallyfys-universal-search-function/) finds the right procedure in seconds. Type any keyword and it searches across:

- Template titles and descriptions
- Individual steps within templates
- [Snippets](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/) (reusable content blocks)
- Comments and notes
- Form field names

Search "refund" and you'll find every procedure mentioning refunds - whether it's in the title, buried in step 7, or mentioned in a comment.

### Change management and watching

Tallyfy's watching feature lets you monitor specific templates for changes.

**Watch frequencies:**
- **Instant** - Critical procedures where any change matters right away
- **Daily digest** - Batch updates for standard procedures
- **Weekly summary** - Low-priority reference materials

**What triggers notifications:**
- Template content changes
- New comments or improvement suggestions
- Permission modifications
- Automation rule updates

### Embedding templates within templates

You can embed one template inside another to eliminate repetition.

**Example**: You have a "Pre-call checklist" template - verify customer account, review history, prepare notes. This checklist applies to multiple processes. Instead of copying these steps into every sales-related template, embed the checklist. Create your "Sales call" template and embed "Pre-call checklist" at the beginning. Do the same for "Support call."

When you update the pre-call checklist, every template using it updates automatically. One source of truth.

**Common embedded templates:**
- Safety checks (embedded in all equipment procedures)
- Data security protocols (embedded in IT processes)
- Customer verification (embedded in service procedures)
- Quality standards (embedded in production templates)

### Snippets for consistent content

[Snippets](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/) keep language consistent across all procedures. Create a snippet for your standard confidentiality notice, insert it into 50 templates, and when the legal language changes - update the snippet once and all 50 templates reflect it.

**Useful snippets to create:**
- Legal disclaimers and compliance statements
- Safety warnings and precautions
- Contact information blocks
- Standard operating conditions
- Common troubleshooting steps

Everyone uses approved language. Marketing won't accidentally use old taglines. Legal won't find outdated disclaimers.

### AI and MCP integration

Connect Tallyfy's knowledge base to any AI platform through the [MCP server](/products/pro/integrations/mcp-server/). An employee asks ChatGPT: "How do I process a return?" The AI searches Tallyfy via MCP, finds your return procedure, and provides step-by-step guidance - always pulling from current procedures.

**Setup steps:**
1. Enable MCP server in Tallyfy settings
2. Configure your AI platform to connect
3. Set appropriate access permissions
4. Test with common queries

### Practical examples

**Entering a sales order** - Your sales team pulls up the procedure during customer calls, follows along, but doesn't need task tracking. Speed matters more than documentation.

**Conference room setup** - Facilities posts the setup checklist as knowledge. Teams reference it when preparing rooms. It's guidance, not governance.

**Password reset procedures** - IT publishes step-by-step instructions. Employees follow them independently without creating tickets for simple resets.

**Expense report guidelines** - Finance maintains current policies and examples. Employees reference them while completing reports in your expense system.

### Setting up knowledge-only workflows

<Steps>
1. **Audit existing documentation** - Identify procedures that need accessibility, not tracking
2. **Create template library** - Build templates for your most-referenced procedures
3. **Organize with folders and tags** - Use labels like "Reference Only" or "How-To Guides"
4. **Set watching preferences** - Configure notification frequencies based on criticality
5. **Train on search** - Show teams how to find information quickly
6. **Encourage commenting** - Build a culture where improvement suggestions are welcomed
7. **Review quarterly** - Check view counts and comments to identify outdated content
</Steps>

Start with your top 10 most-requested procedures and turn them into searchable templates.

### Measuring effectiveness

**Usage metrics to monitor:**
- Template view counts (high views = valuable content)
- Search queries (reveals what people need)
- Comment frequency (shows engagement)
- Update frequency (indicates living documentation)

**Success indicators:**
- Fewer "how do I...?" emails and messages
- New hires becoming productive faster
- Reduced errors from following outdated procedures
- Positive feedback about finding information easily

### Advanced patterns

**Versioned procedures** - Keep previous versions accessible but clearly marked. Sometimes you need to know what the procedure was last quarter for audit purposes.

**Conditional display** - Use [automation rules](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) to show different snippets based on user properties. Show region-specific regulations only to relevant teams.

**Analytics integration** - Export view and search data to your [BI platform](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/) to understand which procedures drive value and which need retirement.

**Collaborative building** - Use comments and [variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/) to crowdsource improvements. Teams contribute examples that make procedures clearer.

### Best practices

**Keep it current** - Set quarterly reviews for critical procedures. Outdated knowledge is worse than no knowledge.

**Write for scanning** - Use clear headings, bullet points, and bold key actions. People skim procedures while working.

**Include examples** - Abstract instructions confuse. Concrete examples clarify.

**Link related content** - Connect procedures that work together. If "Process Order" mentions "Handle Returns," link them.

**Verify accuracy** - Have subject matter experts review procedures before publishing.

**Retire outdated content** - Archive obsolete procedures clearly. Don't let old versions create confusion.
