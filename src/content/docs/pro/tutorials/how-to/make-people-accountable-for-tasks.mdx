## Task accountability in Tallyfy

![Accountability visualized as tasks being passed like hot potatoes on the left transforming to clear ownership with a person confidently holding a task on the right](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/illustrations/accountability.jpeg)

Tallyfy provides features to make accountability clear and lasting.

### Transparent workflows

Making task status visible increases accountability:

- **Public task status**: Tallyfy's dashboard shows who is responsible for active tasks and their current status.
- **Progress tracking**: Visuals highlight where processes are stuck and who is responsible.
- **Timeline views**: History shows when tasks were assigned, started, and completed.
- **Activity tracking**: The system automatically logs actions taken on tasks.

Transparency encourages timely completion without direct intervention.


### Automatic reminders

Automated reminders ensure consistent follow-up:

- **Daily digest emails**: The system sends personalized notifications about pending tasks.
- **Customizable frequency**: Users can set their preferred [reminder schedule](/products/pro/settings/personal-settings/how-can-i-manage-email-notifications-in-tallyfy/).
- **Set-and-forget**: Once set up, reminders work automatically for all tasks.
- **Prioritization**: Reminders highlight overdue tasks and upcoming deadlines.

Automation eliminates manual follow-up and builds accountability into daily work.

### Manual reminders for urgent tasks

For time-sensitive tasks, you can give extra nudges:

- **Instant email reminders**: [Send immediate notifications](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-can-i-send-email-reminders-in-tallyfy/) to all assignees with one click.
- **Custom reminder messages**: Add personal notes to stress urgency or add context.
- **Scheduled follow-ups**: Set calendar reminders to check task progress.
- **Sequential escalation**: Follow a consistent pattern (e.g., reminder -> direct message -> manager involvement).

Reserve manual nudges for urgent situations.

### Single-person ownership with "Take Over"

The Take Over feature clarifies responsibility when multiple people are assigned:

- **Take Over feature**: Tallyfy lets a team member take full ownership of a task.
- **Clear assignment**: When someone takes over, others are removed, making responsibility clear.
- **Voluntary commitment**: Choosing to take over encourages personal ownership.
- **Documented handoffs**: The system logs who took responsibility and when.

This converts group tasks into individual responsibility.

:::note[When to use the 'Take Over' feature]
The Take Over feature is helpful for tasks that:
1. Need one person to make a decision, not group input.
2. Are stuck because ownership is unclear.
3. Need a single point of contact.
4. Benefit from one person being clearly responsible.

### Comments for accountability

Use comments for accountability discussions:

- **Contextual questions**: Ask about task status directly in the task's comments.
- **@mentions**: Tag specific people to ensure they see your comment.
- **Default comments**: Use standard comment templates for consistent check-ins.
- **Comment history**: Keep a documented record of accountability talks.
- **Email notifications**: Comments automatically trigger email alerts.

Comments stay focused on specific tasks rather than general performance.

### Documenting blockers

When tasks are blocked:

- **Blocking comments**: Team members can mark comments as blockers, showing what's stopping progress.
- **Visibility of blockers**: These comments are clearly displayed, showing why a task is delayed.
- **Shared problem-solving**: Transparency helps teams solve problems together.
- **Accountability transfer**: Responsibility can shift to fixing the blocker when needed.

This distinguishes between avoidance and genuine blockers.

### Clear task instructions

Clear instructions improve task completion:

- **Specific instructions**: Include step-by-step guidance.
- **Defined success criteria**: Explain what 'done' looks like.
- **Resource links**: Provide links to needed info, tools, or templates.
- **Supporting documentation**: Attach examples or training materials.



### Task expiration policies

Configure tasks to auto-complete after deadlines to prevent [task debt](/products/pro/tutorials/how-to/how-to-avoid-task-debt/):

- **Expiring task types**: Set up certain tasks to auto-complete after their deadline, perfect for FYI and informational items.
- **Time-based auto-completion**: Create rules for tasks to close automatically after a set time.
- **Clear expectations**: Tell your team about these policies so they know the consequences of inaction.
- **Task prioritization**: Helps separate critical tasks from nice-to-haves.
- **Information sharing without debt**: Use [expiring tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-types-of-tasks-can-i-create-with-tallyfy/) to share updates, resources, or optional content without creating permanent backlog.

This prevents task buildup and creates urgency for truly important items while allowing information sharing without accumulating debt.

### Escalation paths

Structure escalation for accountability issues:

- **Sequential escalation**: Follow a consistent pattern (e.g., reminder -> comment -> manager added).
- **Manager involvement**: Add supervisors as assignees if first steps aren't enough.
- **Pattern recognition**: Track recurring issues to find and fix root causes.
- **Performance connections**: Connect consistent task completion (or lack thereof) to performance reviews.


### Balanced accountability culture

Balance accountability with support:

- **Recognition systems**: Acknowledge people who consistently complete tasks.
- **Constructive approach**: Focus conversations on solving problems, not blaming.
- **Skill development**: Offer training for those struggling with tasks.
- **Reciprocal accountability**: Make managers responsible for providing support and removing obstacles.


### Additional strategies

- **Start with why**: Explain the task's purpose and impact.
- **Manage workloads**: Ensure task loads are reasonable.
- **Time blocking**: Encourage scheduling specific time for tasks.
- **Peer accountability partnerships**: Set up ways for teammates to check in.
- **Breaking down tasks**: Divide big responsibilities into smaller tasks.
- **Success celebration**: Recognize consistent completion to encourage the behavior.
