## How to build an operations manual

An operations manual is key for standardizing Tallyfy procedures, keeping company knowledge, and maintaining consistent quality. Traditional paper manuals can quickly become outdated and, worse still, even when people read them they [forget 90% within a week](/products/pro/tutorials/why-documentation-training-fails-forgetting-curve/). Tallyfy helps turn static documents into dynamic, usable processes using its [operations manual software](https://tallyfy.com/solutions/operations-manual-software/).

### Use digital, device-friendly documentation

Paper binders and static PDFs aren't ideal for today's digital work environments:

- **Automatic conversion**: Upload existing Word docs, PDFs, etc., to Tallyfy. It automatically converts them into web formats accessible on any device.
- **Rich media support**: Add images, videos, and interactive elements to instructions, going beyond just text.
- **Universal accessibility**: Ensure your team can access procedures anytime, anywhere, on any device.

When importing existing documents, start with your core procedures. Tallyfy's conversion features can help turn old documents into interactive processes.

### Replace flowcharts with actionable automations

Flowcharts can sometimes be complex and hard to follow:

- **Flowchart conversion**: Upload existing flowcharts to Tallyfy for automatic conversion.
- **Simple automation rules**: Replace decision points (diamonds) with simple "if-this-then-that" rules using [Tallyfy Automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/).
- **Dynamic process flows**: Create processes that adapt based on inputs, decisions, or changing situations.

This changes diagrams into processes that guide users step-by-step while following business rules.

### Establish ownership and responsibility

Operations manuals need clear owners for both the overall system and individual procedures:

- **System owner**: Appoint one person to oversee all operations documentation.
- **Template owners**: Assign specific process owners using [Tallyfy's folder organization](/products/pro/documenting/templates/how-to-manage-templates-and-processes-with-tags/) in the **Templates** section.
- **Accountability tracking**: Keep a record of who created and last updated each process template.

Documenting ownership helps avoid situations where knowledge is only in someone's head.

### Organize with a logical hierarchy

A clear structure makes finding procedures easier:

- **Folder hierarchies**: Use Tallyfy's folders to group related templates logically.
- **Tagging system**: Use [template tags](/products/pro/documenting/templates/how-to-manage-templates-and-processes-with-tags/) for filtering and organizing across different categories.
- **Naming conventions**: Create consistent naming patterns that clearly identify each template's purpose.

This structure helps team members find the procedures they need quickly.

### Document task information

For each procedure, include key details:

- **Task definition**: Clearly state the task and its purpose.
- **Step-by-step instructions**: Detail how to perform each part of the task.
- **Role assignments**: Assign responsibility for each step.
- **Timing guidance**: Indicate when tasks should be done and expected durations.
- **Required resources**: List necessary systems, tools, or materials.

Using Tallyfy's [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) and task types helps capture this information in a structured way.

### Transform documentation into active execution

An operations manual is most useful when people follow the procedures:

- **Launch processes**: Turn static documents into active work by launching processes from Tallyfy templates.
- **Real-time tracking**: Monitor who has completed which steps using Tallyfy's dashboard.
- **Automated progression**: Automatically move work forward as steps are completed.

Tallyfy makes procedures actionable with built-in tracking.

### Add clarity with rich media

Visuals help people understand and remember procedures better:

- **Incorporate screenshots**: Show users exactly what they should see.
- **Embed videos**: Demonstrate how to perform tasks.
- **Link to resources**: Connect to related materials or examples.

Using rich media can reduce misunderstandings and training time.

### Implement access controls

Not everyone needs permission to edit operations documents:

- **Role-based permissions**: Set up [permissions in Tallyfy](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-do-i-manage-member-permissions-in-tallyfy/) to control who can view, use, or edit templates.
- **Centralized administration**: Keep overall control while giving appropriate access.
- **Version control**: Protect approved procedures while allowing controlled updates.

Access controls stop unwanted changes while ensuring people have the information they need.

### Measure engagement

Analytics show how your operations manual is being used:

- **Google Analytics integration**: Track reading statistics and engagement.
- **Usage patterns**: See which procedures are used or run most often.
- **Completion rates**: Monitor how often processes are completed successfully.

These numbers help identify valuable procedures and areas for improvement.

### Support multilingual operations

For teams working in different languages:

- **Create master templates**: Develop procedures in your organization's primary language.
- **Enable automatic translation**: Use Tallyfy's content translation feature to create versions in other languages.
- **Maintain consistency**: Updates to the master template can automatically apply to translated versions.

This ensures consistent procedures globally and reduces manual translation work.

### Establish continuous improvement mechanisms

An operations manual should change as your organization changes:

- **Encourage improvement comments**: Use Tallyfy's [commenting system](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-report-and-resolve-issues-in-tallyfy/) for feedback.
- **Regular review cycles**: Schedule periodic reviews of procedures with their owners.
- **Track change history**: Keep records of updates and why they were made.

A culture of continuous improvement keeps your operations manual up-to-date and effective.

### Additional practices

- **Onboarding integration**: Link the manual to your employee onboarding.
- **Regulatory compliance**: Tag procedures related to compliance for easy auditing.
- **Searchable content**: Ensure the manual is easily searchable.
- **Mobile compatibility**: Test procedures on mobile devices.
- **Feedback loops**: Provide ways for users to suggest improvements.

By following these guidelines and using Tallyfy, you can build an operations manual that actively supports how your business runs.
