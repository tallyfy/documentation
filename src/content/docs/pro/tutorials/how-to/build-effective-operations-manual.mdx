## How to build an operations manual

![Operations manual transformation visualized as dusty binders and paper documents on the left flowing into a modern digital interface with live workflows on the right - representing the shift from static documentation to dynamic executable processes](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/illustrations/operations-manual.jpeg)

An operations manual standardizes procedures, preserves company knowledge, and keeps quality consistent. But traditional paper manuals go stale fast - and even when people read them, they [forget 90% within a week](/products/pro/tutorials/why-documentation-training-fails-forgetting-curve/). Tallyfy turns static documents into dynamic, trackable processes using its [operations manual software](https://tallyfy.com/solutions/operations-manual-software/).

### Use digital, device-friendly documentation

Paper binders and static PDFs don't work well for modern teams:

- **Automatic conversion** - Upload Word docs, PDFs, or other files to Tallyfy. They're converted into web formats accessible on any device.
- **Rich media** - Add images, videos, and interactive elements to instructions instead of plain text.
- **Access anywhere** - Your team can pull up procedures on any device, anytime.

:::tip[Simplifying migration]
Start with your core procedures when importing existing documents. Tallyfy's conversion features turn old docs into interactive processes.

### Replace flowcharts with actionable automations

Flowcharts are often complex and hard to follow. Here's a better approach:

- **Flowchart conversion** - Upload existing flowcharts to Tallyfy for automatic conversion.
- **Simple automation rules** - Replace decision diamonds with "if-this-then-that" rules using [Tallyfy Automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/).
- **Dynamic process flows** - Create processes that adapt based on inputs, decisions, or changing conditions.

### Establish ownership and responsibility

Every operations manual needs clear owners - both for the overall system and individual procedures:

- **System owner** - Appoint one person to oversee all operations documentation.
- **Template owners** - Assign process owners using [Tallyfy's folder organization](/products/pro/documenting/templates/how-to-manage-templates-and-processes-with-tags/) in the **Templates** section.
- **Accountability tracking** - Record who created and last updated each process template.

This prevents knowledge from living only in someone's head.

### Organize with a logical hierarchy

A clear structure makes procedures easier to find:

- **Folder hierarchies** - Group related templates logically using Tallyfy's folders.
- **Tagging system** - Use [template tags](/products/pro/documenting/templates/how-to-manage-templates-and-processes-with-tags/) for filtering across categories.
- **Naming conventions** - Create consistent naming patterns that identify each template's purpose at a glance.

### Document task information

For each procedure, include these details:

- **Task definition** - State the task and its purpose clearly.
- **Step-by-step instructions** - Detail how to perform each part.
- **Role assignments** - Assign responsibility for each step.
- **Timing guidance** - Specify when tasks should be done and expected durations.
- **Required resources** - List necessary systems, tools, or materials.

Tallyfy's [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) and task types capture this information in a structured way.

### Transform documentation into active execution

An operations manual only works if people actually follow it. Tallyfy makes that happen:

- **Launch processes** - Turn static documents into active work by launching processes from templates.
- **Real-time tracking** - See who's completed which steps on Tallyfy's dashboard.
- **Automated progression** - Work moves forward automatically as steps get completed.

:::note[Tracking execution metrics]
Use Tallyfy's tracking to measure how often procedures are followed. This data helps identify processes that need updates or more training.
:::

### Add clarity with rich media

Visuals help people understand and remember procedures better:

- **Screenshots** - Show users exactly what they should see at each step.
- **Embedded videos** - Demonstrate how to perform tasks.
- **Resource links** - Connect to related materials or examples.

### Set up access controls

Not everyone should be able to edit operations documents:

- **Role-based permissions** - Set up [permissions in Tallyfy](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-do-i-manage-member-permissions-in-tallyfy/) to control who can view, use, or edit templates.
- **Centralized administration** - Keep overall control while giving appropriate access.
- **Version control** - Protect approved procedures while allowing controlled updates.

### Measure engagement

Analytics show how your operations manual is actually being used:

- **Google Analytics integration** - Track reading statistics and engagement.
- **Usage patterns** - See which procedures are used or run most often.
- **Completion rates** - Monitor how often processes finish successfully.

### Support multilingual operations

For teams working across languages:

- **Create master templates** - Write procedures in your organization's primary language.
- **Enable automatic translation** - Use Tallyfy's content translation feature to create versions in other languages.
- **Maintain consistency** - Updates to the master template automatically apply to translated versions.

### Build in continuous improvement

Your operations manual should evolve as your organization does:

- **Improvement comments** - Use Tallyfy's [commenting system](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-report-and-resolve-issues-in-tallyfy/) to collect feedback directly on procedures.
- **Regular review cycles** - Schedule periodic reviews with procedure owners.
- **Change history** - Keep records of what changed and why.

### Additional practices

- **Onboarding integration** - Link the manual to your employee onboarding process.
- **Regulatory compliance** - Tag compliance-related procedures for easy auditing.
- **Searchable content** - Make sure the manual is easy to search.
- **Mobile compatibility** - Test procedures on mobile devices.
- **Feedback loops** - Give users a way to suggest improvements.
