## Building forms in Tallyfy

Tallyfy integrates forms directly with the workflow steps that follow. Unlike standalone form tools, Tallyfy connects data collection to the actual work - forms trigger trackable processes automatically.

### Form submission triggers processes

With standalone form tools, users wonder what happens after they click submit. Tallyfy connects submission directly to a trackable workflow:

- **Submit and track**: Form submission starts the first step of a visible, trackable workflow.
- **Process context built in**: Forms start processes that already have defined action steps.
- **Full visibility**: Submitters can see status updates, approvals, and downstream task progress after submission.

Tallyfy calls these "kick-off forms" because they start processes, not just collect data.

### Email verification for public forms

Public forms can cause problems when submitters use fake or wrong email addresses:

- **Email verification**: Tallyfy's public kick-off forms verify email addresses to confirm submitters are genuine.
- **Secure access links**: Submitters get unique links via email to access and finish forms.
- **Ongoing tracking**: Verified submitters can track their submission status later.
- **Reduced spam**: Verification cuts down on fake entries.


:::tip[Accessing public forms]
To allow public access to your kick-off forms, go to the template editor, find the **Triggers** section, and switch **Public Sharing** to **ON**. You can then copy and share the public link provided.

### Selecting field types

- **Short text**: For names, references, or short answers (max 200 characters).
- **Long text**: For detailed descriptions or notes (max 6,000 characters).
- **Dropdown**: For selecting one option from a predefined list.
- **Radio buttons**: For choosing one option when only a few choices are available.
- **Checklist**: For selecting multiple items or verifying steps.
- **Date**: For capturing specific dates (e.g., deadlines, start dates).
- **File upload**: For collecting documents or images.
- **Table**: For structured data that repeats (like line items).
- **Assignee picker**: For letting the submitter choose who should do a later task.

Each field type supports [validation options](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to make sure data is complete and correctly formatted.

### Breaking forms into steps

Instead of one long form, Tallyfy lets you spread fields across multiple steps:

- **Progressive collection**: Gather information step by step.
- **Real-time saving**: Entries save as they're typed, reducing lost work.
- **Automated reminders**: Tallyfy sends reminders for incomplete steps.
- **Better completion rates**: Shorter forms at each stage mean more finished submissions.


:::note[Keep kick-off forms short]
Make your initial kick-off form brief, asking only for essential information to start the process. You can gather more details in later steps. This lowers the barrier for starting and ensures necessary info is collected when needed.
:::

### Conditional branching

Not all questions apply to everyone. Tallyfy's "if-this-then-that" [automation rules](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) let forms adapt:

- **Conditional visibility**: Show or hide steps based on previous answers.
- **Targeted questions**: Only ask what's relevant to each situation.
- **Less abandonment**: Focused forms lead to higher completion rates.

Learn more about [conditional branching](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/logic-explained/).

### Field validation

- **Input validation**: Check formats for emails, numbers, dates, and more.
- **Required fields**: Make sure critical information isn't skipped.
- **Character limits**: Set minimum and maximum lengths for text fields.
- **Error messages**: Guide users to fix mistakes before submitting.

See [validation options per field type](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/#short-text-field) for details.

### Adding help text

Tallyfy lets you add guidance text to any form field:

- **Field guidance**: Add explanatory text below a field label.
- **Examples and tips**: Show formatting hints or sample answers.
- **Clear labeling**: Use descriptive labels so users know what's expected.
- **Consistent style**: Keep help text formatting the same across your forms.

### Built-in communication

Unlike many form tools, Tallyfy has communication built-in:

- **Contextual comments**: Users can ask questions directly on the form or task.
- **\@mentions**: Tag specific team members to get their attention.
- **Comment history**: Keep a record of discussions for future reference.
- **Notification system**: Alert people when comments need attention.


### Data distribution and integration

- **[Webhooks](/products/pro/documenting/documents/how-to-generate-documents-from-form-fields/)**: Send form data automatically to other systems.
- **API connections**: Connect Tallyfy to other business software.
- **Document generation**: Auto-fill document templates with form data.
- **[Data exports](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/how-can-i-export-form-fields-from-tallyfy-to-spreadsheet/)**: Get form data into spreadsheets or other formats.

### Collaborative form completion

- **Assignee management**: Form starters can assign steps to the right team members.
- **Guest access**: Include external people securely.
- **Task reassignment**: Reassign tasks when someone isn't available.
- **Group assignments**: Assign steps to entire teams.
- **Parallel completion**: Different parts of a process can be done at the same time.


### Document generation from forms

Tallyfy can create documents automatically from form submissions. For example, a form collects client details, project scope, and pricing - then automatically generates a contract PDF.

- **Template-based documents**: Fill contracts, letters, or proposals with form data.
- **Dynamic content**: Documents change based on form answers.
- **Formatted output**: Generate branded PDFs or other formats.
- **Approval steps**: Include review and sign-off in the document workflow.

:::tip[Document generation setup]
To set up document generation:
1. Use the [document generation integration](/products/pro/documenting/documents/how-to-generate-documents-from-form-fields/) to link form fields to document templates.
2. Map form fields to placeholders in your document templates.
3. Configure middleware platforms (like Zapier, Make, n8n) to handle document creation.
4. Set up delivery steps (e.g., email, storage) as later tasks.
:::

:::note[Integration alternatives]
Zapier works for simple connections, but **n8n**, **Make**, or **Microsoft Power Automate** are often more powerful and cost-effective for complex integrations.

For full control, consider Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) to build custom integrations - you can even use AI to help write serverless function code.

### Additional form features

- **Mobile-friendly**: Forms work on phones and tablets.
- **Progress indicators**: Show progress in multi-step forms.
- **Default values**: Pre-fill fields with common answers. See [setting default content for form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-set-default-content-for-form-fields/).
- **Clear next steps**: Tell users what happens after submission.
- **Testing**: Always test forms with real users before a wide release.
