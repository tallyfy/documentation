## How to build forms

Forms are vital for gathering information and starting processes. However, many organizations use forms that aren't connected to the work that follows. Tallyfy integrates forms directly with the steps that come after, linking data collection to action.

### Think beyond form submission to process execution

With standalone form tools, users often wonder what happens after they click submit. Tallyfy connects submission directly to a trackable workflow:

- **From "submit" to "submit and track"**: Tallyfy links form submission to the first step of a visible, trackable workflow.
- **Integrated process context**: Forms start processes that already have context and defined action steps.
- **End-to-end visibility**: Submitters can see what happens to their request after submission.
- **Continuous visibility**: Access status updates, approvals, and downstream task progress.

Tallyfy calls these initial forms "kick-off forms" because they kick off, or start, processes, not just collect data. This ensures the work following submission is managed effectively.

### Verify external submissions with email verification

Public forms can cause problems if submitters use fake or wrong email addresses:

- **Email verification**: Tallyfy's public kick-off forms include email verification to confirm submitters are genuine.
- **Secure access links**: Submitters get unique links via email to access and finish forms.
- **Permanent tracking**: This verification also lets submitters track the status of their submission later.
- **Reduced spam**: Verification helps cut down on form spam and fake entries.

This system balances easy access with security, ensuring submissions are real while giving submitters tracking ability.

:::tip[Accessing public forms]
To allow public access to your kick-off forms, go to the template editor, find the **Triggers** section, and switch **Public Sharing** to **ON**. You can then copy and share the public link provided.

### Select appropriate field types for specific questions

Choosing the right form field type improves the quality of the information you collect:

- **Short text**: For names, references, or short answers (max 200 characters).
- **Long text**: For detailed descriptions or notes (max 6,000 characters).
- **Dropdown**: For selecting one option from a predefined list.
- **Radio buttons**: For choosing one option when only a few choices are available.
- **Checklist**: For selecting multiple items or verifying steps.
- **Date**: For capturing specific dates (e.g., deadlines, start dates).
- **File upload**: For collecting documents or images.
- **Table**: For structured data that repeats (like line items).
- **Assignee picker**: For letting the submitter choose who should do a later task.

Tallyfy's [form builder software](https://tallyfy.com/solutions/form-builder-software/) offers [validation options](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) for each field type, helping ensure data is complete and correctly formatted.

### Break up long forms into manageable steps

Instead of showing one very long form, Tallyfy lets you spread form fields across multiple steps:

- **Progressive data collection**: Gather information step by step.
- **Real-time saving**: Entries are saved as they are typed, reducing lost work.
- **Automated reminders**: Tallyfy can send reminders for incomplete steps.
- **Improved completion rates**: Shorter forms at each stage can lead to more completed submissions.
- **Focused attention**: Users concentrate on smaller sets of questions at a time.

This step-by-step approach helps avoid problems users face with long forms where work might be lost if not saved.

:::note[Keep kick-off forms short]
Make your initial kick-off form brief, asking only for essential information to start the process. You can gather more details in later steps. This lowers the barrier for starting and ensures necessary info is collected when needed.
:::

### Implement conditional branching for dynamic forms

Not all questions apply to everyone. Tallyfy's "if-this-then-that" [automation rules](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) allow forms to adapt:

- **Conditional visibility**: Show or hide steps based on answers to previous questions.
- **Targeted information**: Ask only relevant questions for specific situations.
- **Relevant user experience**: Users don't see fields that don't apply to them.
- **Reduced abandonment**: Keeping forms focused helps increase completion rates.

Using [conditional branching](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/logic-explained/) means users only see and fill out fields relevant to their specific situation.

### Implement field validation for data quality

Fixing data entry problems early is better than cleaning up messy data later:

- **Input validation**: Ensure formats for emails, numbers, dates, etc., are correct.
- **Required fields**: Make sure critical information isn't missed.
- **Character limits**: Set minimum/maximum lengths for text fields.
- **Custom validation**: Apply specific rules if needed.
- **Error messages**: Guide users to fix mistakes.

Tallyfy's [validation options](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/#short-text-field) for each field type help ensure data meets your requirements.

### Provide guidance for form completion

Users might need help understanding what information to provide:

- **Field guidance**: Add explanatory text below a field label.
- **Contextual help**: Give examples or formatting tips.
- **Tooltips and hints**: Offer extra info without cluttering the form.
- **Precise labeling**: Use clear, descriptive labels for fields.
- **Consistent formatting**: Use the same style for help text across forms.

Tallyfy lets you add guidance text to any form field, reducing confusion and improving data quality.

### Enable communication during form completion

Unlike many form tools, Tallyfy has communication built-in:

- **Contextual comments**: Users can ask questions directly on the form or task.
- **\@mentions**: Tag specific team members to get their attention.
- **Comment history**: Keep a record of discussions for future reference.
- **Notification system**: Alert people when comments need attention.

This built-in communication helps teams work together to gather information accurately.

### Plan for data distribution and integration

Think about where form data should go after it's collected:

- **Webhook integration**: Send form data automatically to other systems.
- **API connections**: Connect Tallyfy to other business software for data sharing.
- **Document generation**: Use form data to automatically fill out document templates.
- **Reporting**: Analyze form responses.
- **Data exports**: Get form data into spreadsheets or other formats.

Tallyfy's [webhooks](/products/pro/documenting/documents/how-to-generate-documents-from-form-fields/) and [integration options](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/how-can-i-export-form-fields-from-tallyfy-to-spreadsheet/) ensure collected data can be used effectively elsewhere.

### Enable task delegation for collaborative form completion

Often, forms need information from several people:

- **Assignee management**: Allow form starters to assign steps to the right team members.
- **Guest access**: Include external people in the process securely.
- **Task reassignment**: Reassign tasks if the original person isn't available.
- **Group assignments**: Assign steps to teams.
- **Parallel completion**: Allow different parts of a form or process to be done simultaneously.

This helps manage the challenge of collecting information from multiple sources.

### Generate documents from form data

Tallyfy lets you create documents automatically from form submissions:

- **Template-based documents**: Fill documents like contracts or letters with form data.
- **Dynamic content**: Create documents that change based on form answers.
- **Formatted output**: Generate branded PDFs or other formats.
- **Multi-stage approval**: Include review steps in the document workflow.
- **Revision tracking**: Keep a history of document versions.

For example, a form can collect client details, project scope, and pricing, then automatically generate a contract PDF. This saves time compared to manually copying data.

:::tip[Document generation setup]
To set up document generation:
1. Use the [document generation integration](/products/pro/documenting/documents/how-to-generate-documents-from-form-fields/) to link form fields to document templates.
2. Map form fields to placeholders in your document templates.
3. Configure middleware platforms (like Zapier, Make, n8n) to handle document creation.
4. Set up delivery steps (e.g., email, storage) as later tasks.
:::

:::note[Considering integration alternatives]
While Zapier works for simple connections, we often recommend more powerful and cost-effective middleware like **n8n**, **Make**, or **Microsoft Power Automate** for robust integrations.

For maximum control, especially with development resources, consider Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) to build custom integrations, perhaps using AI to help write code for serverless functions.

This feature connects information collection directly to outputs like documents.

### Additional practices for forms

- **Mobile optimization**: Ensure forms work well on phones and tablets.
- **Consistent branding**: Match your organization's look and feel.
- **Progress indicators**: Show progress in multi-step forms or processes.
- **Default values**: Pre-fill fields with common answers where appropriate.
- **Clear next steps**: Tell users what happens after submission.
- **Accessibility**: Design for users with disabilities.
- **Testing**: Test forms with users before wide release.
- **Analytics integration**: Track completion rates and drop-off points.
- **Continuous improvement**: Update forms based on feedback.

By following these tips and using Tallyfy's integrated forms, you can build forms that effectively gather information and drive action.
