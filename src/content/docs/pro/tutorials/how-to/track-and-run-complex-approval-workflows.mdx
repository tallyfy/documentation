## How to automatically track and run complex approval workflows

Complex approval workflows can sometimes become organizational bottlenecks, with stakeholders unclear on status, requirements, and next steps. Tallyfy can transform these processes into trackable workflows with visibility and accountability at every stage.

### Design kick-off forms for initial information gathering

The foundation of an approval workflow is collecting the right information up front:

- **Identify critical initial data** - Determine what information is necessary before the approval process can begin
- **Create a concise kick-off form** - Design a [form with only essential fields](/products/pro/tutorials/how-to/build-effective-forms/) to lower the barrier to submission
- **Use appropriate field types** - Select the [appropriate form field types](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) for each piece of information (dropdown lists for preset options, file uploads for supporting documents, etc.)
- **Include field guidance** - Add helpful instructions to each field explaining what information is needed and why
- **Consider validation rules** - Apply [field validation](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/#short-text-field) to ensure data quality and completeness

### Break down the approval process into distinct steps

Complex approvals become more manageable when divided into distinct steps:

- **Map the full process** - Identify every step required from submission to final approval
- **Define the approval sequence** - Establish the order in which approvals must occur
- **Identify stakeholders** - Determine who needs to provide input or approval at each stage
- **Document policy requirements** - Incorporate organizational policies into step descriptions and requirements
- **Consider parallel and sequential approvals** - Determine which approvals can happen simultaneously and which must follow a sequence

Each step in Tallyfy can be configured as a standard task or as an [approve/reject task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-types-of-tasks-can-i-create-with-tallyfy/#approvereject) with specific action buttons that clarify the expected action.

### Implement visibility automation for conditional pathways

Not all steps apply to every approval scenario. Use conditional rules to show only relevant tasks:

- **Identify decision points** - Determine where the process may branch based on specific conditions
- **Create "if this, then that" rules** - Use [Tallyfy's automation system](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) to define conditional logic
- **Set visibility conditions** - Configure [visibility actions](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/actions/visibility-actions/) to show or hide steps based on specific conditions
- **Create dynamic approval paths** - Ensure only relevant approvers see tasks based on submission criteria

For example, you might create rules like:
```
IF (Purchase Amount) is greater than $10,000
THEN SHOW "CFO Approval"
```

This approach ensures stakeholders only see tasks relevant to the specific scenario.

### Configure dynamic assignment rules

Ensure tasks are automatically routed to the right approvers with assignment automation:

- **Identify role-based assignments** - Determine which roles should handle each approval step
- **Create variable assignments** - Use [assignment actions](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/actions/asignment-actions/) to dynamically assign tasks based on form inputs
- **Implement conditional routing** - Route approvals to different people based on departments, amounts, or other factors
- **Set up backup assignments** - Ensure coverage for absences by assigning to groups or multiple individuals

For example, you might create assignment rules like:
```
IF (Purchase Category) is "Software"
THEN assign "Vendor Privacy Review" to "Jane Doe"
```

Dynamic assignment ensures the right experts review each request without requiring manual routing decisions.

### Leverage real-time tracking for approval status visibility

A key aspect of complex approval workflows is maintaining visibility into status and progress:

- **Central tracking dashboard** - Monitor all approval processes in the [Tracker view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/how-can-i-manage-and-track-my-processes-on-tallyfy/)
- **Real-time status updates** - See which approval step is active and who's responsible
- **Deadline monitoring** - Track approaching and overdue approvals with color-coded indicators
- **Progress visualization** - View completion percentages and remaining steps at a glance
- **Detailed activity logs** - Access [activity history](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/how-can-i-track-process-activities-on-tallyfy/) showing every action taken

This eliminates many "where is this?" and "what's the status?" questions, giving everyone visibility into where things stand.

### Implement automated reminders for timely completion

Keep approvals moving forward with automated follow-up:

- **Scheduled email digests** - Configure [automatic reminders](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-can-i-send-email-reminders-in-tallyfy/) to notify approvers of pending tasks
- **Escalation pathways** - Set up [automation rules](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/actions/status-actions/) to notify managers if approvals are delayed
- **Custom notification schedules** - Allow users to customize their [reminder frequency](/products/pro/settings/personal-settings/how-can-i-manage-email-notifications-in-tallyfy/) while ensuring minimum coverage
- **Manual reminder options** - Enable process owners to send [immediate reminders](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-can-i-send-email-reminders-in-tallyfy/#sending-manual-ad-hoc-reminders) for urgent approvals

This reminder system ensures approvals don't stall due to missed notifications or competing priorities.

### Enable contextual communication within the workflow

Approval decisions often require clarification or additional information. Tallyfy's commenting system keeps this communication in context:

- **Step-specific comments** - Provide feedback or ask questions directly within specific approval steps
- **\@mentions** - Tag relevant stakeholders in comments to ensure they're notified
- **Embedded context** - Reduce the need to re-explain the entire approval context with each question
- **Conditional approvals** - Facilitate more nuanced responses like "I will approve this if you can provide X"
- **Comment history** - Maintain a record of all discussions for future reference

This approach transforms approvals from simple yes/no decisions into collaborative problem-solving that addresses concerns while keeping the process moving forward.

### Organize and archive completed approvals

Maintain order and facilitate reference to past approvals:

- **Tagging system** - Require initial submitters to [tag or categorize](/products/pro/documenting/templates/how-to-manage-templates-and-processes-with-tags/) the approval request
- **Folder organization** - Automatically file completed approvals in appropriate [organizational folders](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/organize-processes/)
- **Searchable archives** - Locate past approvals using search and filtering
- **Data extraction** - [Export approval data](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/how-can-i-export-tallyfy-processes-to-csv/) for analysis and reporting
- **Retention policies** - Implement systematic archiving based on organizational requirements

This organizational approach ensures completed approvals remain accessible for reference, audits, or pattern analysis while keeping active process views organized.

### Go beyond traditional flowchart thinking

Complex approval workflows can challenge traditional flowchart models, which may struggle to represent human judgment, exceptions, and communication:

- **Human-centered design** - Build workflows that accommodate decision complexity
- **Flexible pathways** - Allow for deviations and exceptions
- **Continuous improvement** - Learn from each approval cycle to refine the process
- **Contextual collaboration** - Facilitate discussion and negotiation needed for approval decisions
- **Adaptable framework** - Create approval processes that evolve with your organization

Tallyfy's approach supports complex approvals as collaborative human processes, not just mechanical routing of requests.

### Best practices for approval workflow implementation

- **Start simple** - Begin with core steps and add complexity gradually as the process matures
- **Involve stakeholders** - Get input from approvers when designing the workflow
- **Test** - Run pilot approval workflows before full deployment
- **Document guidelines** - Create criteria for approval decisions
- **Review regularly** - Analyze completed approvals to identify bottlenecks or improvement opportunities
- **Train participants** - Ensure all stakeholders understand how to use the system
- **Measure performance** - Track key metrics like approval cycle time, bottlenecks, and completion rates

By following these principles and using Tallyfy's workflow management capabilities, you can transform approval processes into more efficient and transparent operations.
