## Track and run complex approval workflows

Complex approval workflows can cause slowdowns, with people unsure about status, requirements, or next steps. Tallyfy helps turn these into trackable workflows with clear visibility and accountability.

### Design kick-off forms

Start approval workflows with the right information:

- **Identify critical initial data**: Figure out what information is needed before approval can start.
- **Create a concise kick-off form**: Design a [form with only essential fields](/products/pro/tutorials/how-to/build-effective-forms/) to make it easier to submit.
- **Use appropriate field types**: Choose the right [form field types](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) (e.g., dropdowns, file uploads).
- **Include field guidance**: Add instructions explaining what info is needed.
- **Consider validation rules**: Use [field validation](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/#short-text-field) to ensure data quality.

### Break down approval steps

Divide complex approvals into separate steps:

- **Map the full process**: Identify every required step from start to finish.
- **Define the approval sequence**: Set the order for approvals.
- **Identify stakeholders**: Determine who needs to approve or give input at each stage.
- **Document policy requirements**: Include company policies in step instructions.
- **Consider parallel and sequential approvals**: Decide which steps can happen at the same time and which must follow an order.

Each step in Tallyfy can be a standard task or an [approve/reject task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-types-of-tasks-can-i-create-with-tallyfy/#approvereject) with clear action buttons.

### Approval workflow visualization

This diagram shows how a typical purchase approval process flows through various decision points and assignments.

# Approval Workflow Visualization

# Initial Request
initial_request: "Initial Request" {
  Start: "Submit Request" {
    shape: circle
    style.fill: "#90ee90"
  }
  Form: "Kick-off Form" {
    shape: rectangle
    style.fill: "#e6f3ff"
  }
  Start -> Form
}

initial_request.Form -> Validate

Validate: "Validate Request" {
  shape: diamond
  style.fill: "#fffacd"
}

Return: "Return for Correction"

Validate -> Return: "No"
Return -> initial_request.Form

Validate -> Amount: "Yes"

Amount: "Check Amount" {
  shape: diamond
  style.fill: "#fffacd"
}

CFO: "CFO Approval" {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#ffcccc"
}

Category: "Check Category" {
  shape: diamond
  style.fill: "#fffacd"
}

Amount -> Category: "< $10,000"
Amount -> CFO: "≥ $10,000"

Privacy: "Privacy Review\n(Jane Doe)" {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#cce5ff"
}
IT: "IT Review" {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#cce5ff"
}
Procurement: "Procurement Review" {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#cce5ff"
}

Category -> Privacy: "Software"
Category -> IT: "Hardware"
Category -> Procurement: "Services"

Manager: "Manager Approval" {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#ffcc99"
}

Privacy -> Manager
IT -> Manager
Procurement -> Manager
CFO -> Manager

Decision: "Final Decision" {
  shape: diamond
  style.fill: "#fffacd"
}

Manager -> Decision

Archive: "Archive Process" {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#d4edda"
}

Notify: "Notify Rejection" {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#f8d7da"
}

End: "End" {
  shape: circle
  style.fill: "#808080"
}

Decision -> Archive: "Yes"
Decision -> Notify: "No"

Archive -> End
Notify -> End

# Reminder automation (dotted lines)
Reminder: "Send Reminder" {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#fff3cd"
}

Manager -> Reminder: "Overdue" {
  style.stroke-dash: 5
  style.stroke: "#ff9800"
}
Reminder -> Manager {

# Archive link: /products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/organize-processes/index/ "Organize completed processes"
```

**What to notice:**
- High-value purchases (≥$10,000) automatically trigger additional CFO approval, ensuring financial oversight
- The system routes reviews to specialists based on purchase category - software goes to Jane Doe for privacy review
- Overdue tasks trigger automated reminders (shown with dotted lines) without manual intervention

### Implement conditional visibility

Not all steps apply in every situation. Use rules to show only relevant tasks:

- **Identify decision points**: Find where the process might split based on conditions.
- **Create "if-this-then-that" rules**: Use [Tallyfy's automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) to set up logic.
- **Set visibility conditions**: Use [visibility actions](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/actions/visibility-actions/) to show/hide steps based on conditions.
- **Create dynamic approval paths**: Ensure approvers only see relevant tasks.

For example:
```
IF (Purchase Amount) is greater than $10,000
THEN SHOW "CFO Approval"
```
This ensures people only see tasks relevant to the specific approval situation.

### Configure dynamic assignments

Automatically send tasks to the right approvers:

- **Identify role-based assignments**: Decide which roles handle each step.
- **Create variable assignments**: Use [assignment actions](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/actions/asignment-actions/) to assign tasks based on form answers.
- **Implement conditional routing**: Send approvals to different people based on department, amount, etc.
- **Set up backup assignments**: Assign to groups or multiple people to cover absences.

For example:
```
IF (Purchase Category) is "Software"
THEN assign "Vendor Privacy Review" to "Jane Doe"
```
Dynamic assignment sends requests to the right experts without needing someone to route manually.

### Track approval status in real-time

- **Central tracking dashboard**: Monitor all approvals in the [Tracker view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/how-can-i-manage-and-track-my-processes-on-tallyfy/).
- **Real-time status updates**: See which step is active and who is responsible.
- **Deadline monitoring**: Track upcoming and overdue approvals (color-coded).
- **Progress visualization**: View completion percentage and remaining steps.
- **Detailed activity logs**: Access [history](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/how-can-i-track-process-activities-on-tallyfy/) showing every action.

This avoids many status questions and gives everyone visibility.

### Set up automated reminders

Keep approvals moving with automatic follow-up:

- **Scheduled email digests**: Set up [automatic reminders](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-can-i-send-email-reminders-in-tallyfy/) for pending tasks.
- **Escalation pathways**: Create [automation rules](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/actions/status-actions/) to notify managers about delays.
- **Custom notification schedules**: Let users adjust [reminder frequency](/products/pro/settings/personal-settings/how-can-i-manage-email-notifications-in-tallyfy/) (within limits).
- **Manual reminder options**: Allow process owners to send [immediate reminders](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-can-i-send-email-reminders-in-tallyfy/#sending-manual-ad-hoc-reminders) for urgent items.

This system ensures approvals don't get stuck because of missed emails or busy schedules.

### Enable workflow communication

Approvals often need more info or discussion. Tallyfy's comments keep this communication organized:

- **Step-specific comments**: Ask questions or give feedback directly on approval steps.
- **\@mentions**: Tag people in comments to get their attention.
- **Embedded context**: Reduces the need to re-explain the situation with every question.
- **Conditional approvals**: Allows for more detailed responses like "Approved if you provide X".
- **Comment history**: Keeps a record of discussions.

This turns simple yes/no decisions into collaborative problem-solving, keeping things moving.

### Organize and archive approvals

Keep records organized and easy to find:

- **Tagging system**: Have submitters [tag or categorize](/products/pro/documenting/templates/how-to-manage-templates-and-processes-with-tags/) requests.
- **Folder organization**: Automatically file completed approvals into the right [folders](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/organize-processes/).
- **Searchable archives**: Find past approvals easily using search and filters.
- **Data extraction**: [Export approval data](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/how-can-i-export-tallyfy-processes-to-csv/) for reporting.
- **Retention policies**: Set up organized archiving based on company rules.

This keeps completed approvals accessible for audits or analysis while keeping active views clean.

### Beyond flowcharts

Traditional flowcharts don't handle human judgment, exceptions, or communication well:

- **Human-centered design**: Build workflows that handle complex decisions.
- **Flexible pathways**: Allow for differences and exceptions.
- **Continuous improvement**: Learn from each approval to improve the process.
- **Contextual collaboration**: Support the discussion needed for approvals.
- **Adaptable framework**: Create processes that can change with the organization.

Tallyfy treats complex approvals as collaborative human processes, not just requests being sent around.

### Best practices

- **Start simple**: Begin with core steps and add complexity slowly as needed.
- **Involve stakeholders**: Get input from approvers when designing.
- **Test**: Run pilot approvals small-scale first.
- **Document guidelines**: Create clear criteria for approval decisions.
- **Review regularly**: Analyze completed approvals to find improvements.
- **Train participants**: Make sure everyone understands the system.
- **Measure performance**: Track metrics like approval time and bottlenecks.
