## Turn multi-level approvals into trackable processes

Complex approvals slow things down when people can't see the status, requirements, or next steps. Tallyfy turns these into trackable workflows with clear visibility and accountability.

### Design kick-off forms

Start with the right information upfront:

- **Identify required data** - determine what's needed before approval can begin.
- **Build a concise kick-off form** - include only [essential fields](/products/pro/tutorials/how-to/build-effective-forms/) so it's easy to submit.
- **Pick the right field types** - use appropriate [form field types](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) (dropdowns, file uploads, etc.).
- **Add field guidance** - explain what info is needed and why.
- **Set validation rules** - use [field validation](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/#short-text-field) to catch bad data early.

:::tip[Auto-creating from existing documents]
If your approval workflow already exists in a document, Tallyfy can convert it into a template automatically. Upload the document and it'll try to extract steps.
:::

### Break down approval steps

Divide approvals into distinct steps:

- **Map the full process** - list every step from start to finish.
- **Define the sequence** - set which approvals come first.
- **Identify stakeholders** - decide who approves or gives input at each stage.
- **Include policy requirements** - add company policies to step instructions.
- **Plan parallel vs. sequential** - decide which steps can run at the same time and which must follow an order.

Each step in Tallyfy can be a standard task or an [approve/reject task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-types-of-tasks-can-i-create-with-tallyfy/#approvereject) with clear action buttons.

### Approval workflow visualization

Here's how a typical purchase approval flows through decision points and assignments.

# Purchase Approval Workflow

direction: down

# Start and End
Start: Submit Request {
  shape: circle
  style.fill: "#f2faf4"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

End: Complete {
  shape: circle
  style.fill: "#e1f7e6"

}

# Decision Points

}

Category: Check Type {

  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

Decision: Approved? {
  shape: diamond
  style.fill: "#f2faf4"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

# Reviewers
Privacy: Privacy Review {
  style.fill: "#e1f7e6"

IT: IT Review {

  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

Procure: Procurement {
  style.fill: "#e1f7e6"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

CFO: CFO Approval {
  style.fill: "#e1f7e6"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

Manager: Manager Review {
  style.fill: "#e1f7e6"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

# Main flow
Start -> Validate

Validate -> Start: Fix Data {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.stroke-dash: 3
}
Validate -> Amount: OK {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

Amount -> Category: Under 10K {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}
Amount -> CFO: Over 10K {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

Category -> Privacy: Software {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}
Category -> IT: Hardware {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}
Category -> Procure: Services {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

Privacy -> Manager {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}
IT -> Manager {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}
Procure -> Manager {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}
CFO -> Manager {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

Manager -> Decision {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

Decision -> End: Yes {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}
Decision -> End: No {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.stroke-dash: 3
}
```

**What to notice:**
- High-value purchases (over $10,000) automatically route to CFO approval for financial oversight
- Reviews go to specialists based on purchase category - software triggers a privacy review, hardware goes to IT, services go to procurement
- Invalid data loops back to the submitter for correction (shown with dashed lines)

### Set up conditional visibility

Not every step applies in every situation. Use rules to show only what's relevant:

- **Identify decision points** - find where the process splits based on conditions.
- **Create if-this-then-that rules** - use [Tallyfy's automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) to set up logic.
- **Set visibility conditions** - use [visibility actions](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/actions/visibility-actions/) to show or hide steps.
- **Build dynamic approval paths** - approvers only see tasks that apply to them.

For example:
```
IF (Purchase Amount) is greater than $10,000
THEN SHOW "CFO Approval"
```
This way, people only see tasks relevant to their specific approval.

### Configure dynamic assignments

Automatically route tasks to the right approvers:

- **Define role-based assignments** - decide which roles handle each step.
- **Use variable assignments** - use [assignment actions](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/actions/asignment-actions/) to assign tasks based on form answers.
- **Add conditional routing** - send approvals to different people based on department, amount, or category.
- **Set up backups** - assign to groups or multiple people to cover absences.

For example:
```
IF (Purchase Category) is "Software"
THEN assign "Vendor Privacy Review" to "Jane Doe"
```
This sends requests to the right experts without manual routing.

### Track approval status in real time

- **Central dashboard** - monitor all approvals in the [Tracker view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/how-can-i-manage-and-track-my-processes-on-tallyfy/).
- **Live status updates** - see which step is active and who's responsible.
- **Deadline monitoring** - track upcoming and overdue approvals with color coding.
- **Progress visualization** - view completion percentage and remaining steps.
- **Activity logs** - access [history](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/how-can-i-track-process-activities-on-tallyfy/) showing every action taken.

No more "where is my approval?" questions.

### Set up automated reminders

Keep approvals moving with automatic follow-up:

- **Scheduled email digests** - set up [automatic reminders](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-can-i-send-email-reminders-in-tallyfy/) for pending tasks.
- **Escalation paths** - create [automation rules](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/actions/status-actions/) to notify managers about delays.
- **Custom notification schedules** - let users adjust [reminder frequency](/products/pro/settings/personal-settings/how-can-i-manage-email-notifications-in-tallyfy/).
- **Manual reminders** - process owners can send [immediate reminders](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-can-i-send-email-reminders-in-tallyfy/#sending-manual-ad-hoc-reminders) for urgent items.

Approvals won't get stuck because of missed emails or busy schedules.

### Enable workflow communication

Approvals often need extra info or discussion. Tallyfy's comments keep this organized:

- **Step-specific comments** - ask questions or give feedback directly on approval steps.
- **@mentions** - tag people in comments to get their attention.
- **Embedded context** - no need to re-explain the situation with every question.
- **Conditional approvals** - respond with "Approved if you provide X" instead of just yes/no.
- **Comment history** - keeps a full record of discussions for audit purposes.

### Organize and archive approvals

Keep records organized and easy to find:

- **Tagging** - have submitters [tag or categorize](/products/pro/documenting/templates/how-to-manage-templates-and-processes-with-tags/) requests.
- **Folder organization** - file completed approvals into the right [folders](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/organize-processes/).
- **Searchable archives** - find past approvals using search and filters.
- **Data export** - [export approval data](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/how-can-i-export-tallyfy-processes-to-csv/) for reporting.
- **Retention policies** - set up archiving based on company rules.

Completed approvals stay accessible for audits while keeping active views clean.

### Best practices

- **Start simple** - begin with core steps and add complexity only as needed.
- **Involve approvers early** - get their input when designing the workflow.
- **Test small** - run pilot approvals before rolling out broadly.
- **Document criteria** - create clear guidelines for approval decisions.
- **Review regularly** - analyze completed approvals to find bottlenecks and improvements.
- **Track metrics** - measure approval time, rejection rates, and delays.

Tallyfy treats approvals as collaborative human processes, not just requests being routed around.
