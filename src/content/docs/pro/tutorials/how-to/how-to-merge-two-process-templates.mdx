import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Tallyfy doesn't offer a direct feature to merge two existing [procedure templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) into a single one. However, you can achieve a similar result by using external AI tools and Tallyfy's document import capabilities. This guide outlines a manual workaround.

## Prerequisites

-   You have two existing [procedure templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in Tallyfy that you want to merge.
-   Access to an AI content generation tool (e.g., ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Claude).
-   Ability to convert text or markdown from the AI tool into a Microsoft Word (`.docx`) or PDF (`.pdf`) file.

## Steps to merge two templates

<Steps>
	1. **Export your existing templates**
</Steps>

	First, you need to get the content of both [procedure templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) out of Tallyfy. You can do this by exporting them as PDF documents, or by printing them which can often be saved as a Word document.

	Refer to the guide on how to [Print, download, and export Tallyfy templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/print-download-export-templates/) for detailed instructions on getting your templates into a document format. You will need one document for each template.
<Steps>
	2. **Use an AI tool to merge the documents**
</Steps>

	Once you have both templates as separate documents (e.g., two PDF or Word files), you can use your preferred AI tool to combine them.

	Upload both documents to the AI tool and provide a prompt similar to this:

	```text
	I use Tallyfy - which helps me create and run process templates. I have two process templates which I need you to combine into a single one. Both of the process templates are attached as documents. Make sure you keep all details within both without losing any details. You should start by identifying the commonalities first and then adding the differences between the first and second into the single output or result. The end result should be a set of process steps which combines both of these without losing the detail present within each one, including descriptions of how to do steps. I intend to import this final result into Tallyfy to create my template there.
	```

	Review the output from the AI tool carefully to ensure it has accurately merged the steps and details from both original templates.
<Steps>
	3. **Convert AI output to Word or PDF**
</Steps>
	The AI tool will likely provide the merged process in a text or markdown format. Before you can import this into Tallyfy, you\'ll need to convert this output into a Microsoft Word (`.docx`) or PDF (`.pdf`) file. You can use various online converters or word processing software for this conversion.
<Steps>
	4. **Create a new template in Tallyfy by uploading the merged document**
</Steps>
	With your merged process now in a Word or PDF file, you can create a new [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in Tallyfy by uploading this file.


	Follow the instructions in the "Create a template by uploading an existing document" section of the [Create a template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/create-template/) article. Tallyfy's AI will analyze your uploaded document and attempt to convert it into a new Tallyfy template.


:::note[Review and refine]
After importing, carefully review the newly created template in Tallyfy. You may need to adjust steps, formatting, assignments, or add [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) as Tallyfy's AI interpretation of the uploaded document might not be perfect.

This workaround provides a way to combine the content of two templates, although it requires manual steps and careful review.
