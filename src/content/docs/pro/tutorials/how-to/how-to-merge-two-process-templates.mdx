Tallyfy doesn't have a built-in feature to merge two [procedure templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) into one. But you can work around this by exporting both templates as documents, using an AI tool to combine them, and importing the result back into Tallyfy.

## Prerequisites

- Two existing [procedure templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in Tallyfy that you want to merge.
- Access to an AI tool (e.g., ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Claude).
- A way to convert the AI tool's output into a Word (`.docx`) or PDF (`.pdf`) file.

## Steps to merge two templates

<Steps>

1. **Export your existing templates**

   Get the content of both templates out of Tallyfy by exporting them as PDFs, or by printing them to a Word document. See [Print, download, and export Tallyfy templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/print-download-export-templates/) for details. You'll need one document for each template.

2. **Use an AI tool to merge the documents**

   Upload both documents to your AI tool and provide a prompt like this:

   ```text
   I use Tallyfy - which helps me create and run process templates. I have two process templates which I need you to combine into a single one. Both of the process templates are attached as documents. Make sure you keep all details within both without losing any details. You should start by identifying the commonalities first and then adding the differences between the first and second into the single output or result. The end result should be a set of process steps which combines both of these without losing the detail present within each one, including descriptions of how to do steps. I intend to import this final result into Tallyfy to create my template there.
   ```

   Review the AI's output carefully to make sure it accurately merged the steps and details from both templates.

3. **Convert AI output to Word or PDF**

   The AI tool will likely return the merged process as text or markdown. You'll need to convert this into a Word (`.docx`) or PDF (`.pdf`) file before importing. Use any online converter or word processor.

4. **Upload the merged document as a new Tallyfy template**

   Follow the "Create a template by uploading an existing document" instructions in [Create a template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/create-template/). Tallyfy's AI will analyze the uploaded document and convert it into a new template.

</Steps>

:::note[Review and refine]
After importing, review the new template carefully. You may need to adjust steps, formatting, assignments, or add [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) - Tallyfy's AI interpretation of the uploaded document might not be perfect.
