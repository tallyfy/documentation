## How to track time in Tallyfy

You can track time by adding number fields to tasks with validation rules. This captures hours and minutes spent on each task - useful for cost analysis and workflow measurement.

### Prerequisites

- Administrator or Standard user role
- Access to edit [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)
- Familiarity with [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/)

### When to use time tracking

Time tracking works best for:
- Billable client work requiring accurate hour logs
- Process improvement measuring task efficiency
- Compliance requirements mandating time documentation
- Resource planning based on actual task duration

## Steps to set up time tracking

<Steps>
1. **Open your template for editing**
   Go to the **Templates** tab and open the template where you want time tracking. Click **Edit Template**.

2. **Select the task**
   Click on the specific task (step) where team members should log their time.

3. **Add the hours field**
   - Click **Add Form Field** in the task editor
   - Select **Short Text** field type
   - Configure:
     - **Field Name**: "Hours spent on this task"
     - **Validation**: Select "Number"
     - **Minimum Value**: 0
     - **Maximum Value**: 999 (adjust as needed)
     - **Suffix**: "hrs"
     - **Required**: Check if time tracking is mandatory
     - **Guidance Text**: "Enter whole hours only (0-999)"

4. **Add the minutes field**
   - Click **Add Form Field** again
   - Select **Short Text** field type
   - Configure:
     - **Field Name**: "Minutes spent on this task"
     - **Validation**: Select "Number"
     - **Minimum Value**: 0
     - **Maximum Value**: 59
     - **Suffix**: "min"
     - **Required**: Check if needed
     - **Guidance Text**: "Enter minutes (0-59)"

5. **Optional: Add a notes field**
   Add a **Long Text** field:
   - **Field Name**: "Time tracking notes"
   - **Guidance Text**: "Optional: Add notes about time spent or delays"
   - **Required**: Leave unchecked

6. **Save and test**
   Click **Save Template** and launch a test process to verify the fields work correctly.
</Steps>

## Advanced configurations

### Using variables to display time

Tallyfy doesn't auto-calculate totals, but you can use [variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/) to show entered time in later tasks:

1. In a later task's description, insert: `{{Hours spent on this task}} hours and {{Minutes spent on this task}} minutes were logged`
2. This gives approvers or reviewers visibility into time spent

### Time-based automations

Use [automation rules](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) to trigger actions based on time entries:

- If hours spent > 8, assign a task to a manager for review
- If total time exceeds budget, send a notification email

### Project-wide time tracking

To track time across an entire process:

1. Add time fields to every task that needs measurement
2. Create a summary task at the end titled "Time Tracking Summary"
3. List all time variables from previous tasks in the description
4. Export data via [CSV](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/how-can-i-export-tallyfy-processes-to-csv/) for analysis

## Why accurate time tracking is hard

### Multi-tasking makes tracking difficult

People rarely work on one task at a time. Someone might spend 30 minutes on a task, get pulled into a meeting, answer emails, then finish an hour later. Did that take 30 minutes or 90? Both answers have merit.

### Holidays and absences skew averages

A task assigned on December 23rd might sit untouched until January 2nd. That's not a 10-day task - it's a 2-hour task with an 8-day holiday in the middle.

### External delays aren't the assignee's fault

Waiting for client feedback, dependencies on delayed tasks, or system outages all add time that has nothing to do with actual work effort.

### The fix: Ask for time input directly

Add a form field asking assignees to record their actual working time. It's one more field to fill out - but it gives you clean data about real effort.

Why this works:
- People know how much time they actually spent (not elapsed time)
- External delays don't contaminate your data
- You can still track elapsed time through Tallyfy's built-in timestamps

### Analytics timestamps have the same challenges

Timestamps in Tallyfy Analytics and CSV exports measure elapsed time between task assignment and completion. They're subject to all the issues above. That "3-day average" might represent 30 minutes of work spread across a long weekend. Use effort tracking fields for cleaner metrics.

## Best practices

### Field naming conventions
Use consistent naming for easier reporting:
- "Task Name - Hours"
- "Task Name - Minutes"

### Setting realistic limits
- Set maximum hours based on typical task duration
- Use validation to prevent data entry errors
- Consider dropdown lists for standard time increments

### Training your team
- Add guidance text explaining time tracking expectations
- Specify whether to track active work time or total elapsed time
- Explain the difference between effort time and elapsed time

### Regular analysis
- Export process data monthly to spot time trends
- Identify tasks consistently taking longer than expected
- Consider both effort metrics and elapsed time when analyzing bottlenecks

## Common scenarios

### Billable hours tracking
For client billing, consider adding:
- A "Billable?" radio button field (Yes/No)
- A "Billing Code" dropdown field
- Separate fields for billable vs non-billable time

### Compliance time logs
For regulatory requirements:
- Make all time fields required
- Include fields for start time, end time, break duration, and delay reasons

### Performance metrics
To measure efficiency:
- Track both estimated and actual time
- Add "Estimated Hours" and "Estimated Minutes" fields
- Compare estimates to actuals in your analysis

## Extracting time tracking data

### Manual CSV export
1. Open any running process with time tracking
2. Click **Settings** > **Export CSV**
3. Open in Excel or Google Sheets
4. Sum time columns for total duration

### Automated reporting via API
Use the [Tallyfy API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) to:
- Pull time data into business intelligence tools
- Create automated time reports
- Integrate with billing systems

### Real-time notifications
Configure [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) to:
- Alert when time exceeds thresholds
- Send daily time summaries
- Trigger billing system updates

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Users entering time in wrong format
**Solution**: Use dropdown fields with preset time options instead of text entry

**Problem**: Forgetting to track time
**Solution**: Make time fields required and add reminder text

**Problem**: Time entries seem inaccurate
**Solution**: Add a "Time Entry Method" field with options like "Timer", "Estimate", "Calculated"
