## Implementing time tracking in Tallyfy workflows

You can track time in Tallyfy by adding number fields to tasks with validation rules. This creates a simple time tracking system that captures hours and minutes spent on each task, enabling accurate workflow measurement and cost analysis.

Time tracking helps measure task duration, calculate project costs, identify process bottlenecks, and improve resource allocation. Here's how to implement it effectively.

### Prerequisites

- Administrator or Standard user role  
- Access to edit [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)
- Basic understanding of [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/)

### When to use time tracking

Time tracking works best for:
- Billable client work requiring accurate hour logs
- Process improvement initiatives measuring task efficiency  
- Compliance requirements mandating time documentation
- Resource planning based on actual task duration
- Cost analysis for specific workflow steps

## Steps to implement time tracking

<Steps>
1. **Open your template for editing**
   Navigate to the **Templates** tab and open the template where you want to add time tracking. Click **Edit Template** to enter edit mode.

2. **Select the task requiring time tracking**
   Click on the specific task (step) where team members should log their time. This opens the task editor panel.

3. **Add the hours field**
   - Click **Add Form Field** in the task editor
   - Select **Short Text** field type
   - Configure these settings:
     - **Field Name**: "Hours spent on this task"
     - **Validation**: Select "Number" from the dropdown
     - **Minimum Value**: 0
     - **Maximum Value**: 999 (adjust based on your needs)
     - **Suffix**: "hrs" (appears after the input)
     - **Required**: Check if time tracking is mandatory
     - **Guidance Text**: "Enter whole hours only (0-999)"

4. **Add the minutes field**  
   - Click **Add Form Field** again
   - Select **Short Text** field type
   - Configure these settings:
     - **Field Name**: "Minutes spent on this task"
     - **Validation**: Select "Number" from the dropdown
     - **Minimum Value**: 0
     - **Maximum Value**: 59
     - **Suffix**: "min" (appears after the input)
     - **Required**: Check if needed
     - **Guidance Text**: "Enter minutes (0-59)"

5. **Optional: Add a total time calculation field**
   For reference, add a **Long Text** field with instructions:
   - **Field Name**: "Time tracking notes"
   - **Guidance Text**: "Optional: Add any notes about time spent or delays encountered"
   - **Required**: Leave unchecked

6. **Save and test your template**
   Click **Save Template** and launch a test process to verify the time tracking fields work correctly.
</Steps>

## Advanced time tracking configurations

### Using variables to calculate total time

While Tallyfy doesn't automatically calculate totals, you can use [variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/) to display entered time in subsequent tasks:

1. In a later task description, insert variables: `{{Hours spent on this task}} hours and {{Minutes spent on this task}} minutes were logged`
2. This creates visibility of time spent for approvers or reviewers

### Setting up time-based automations

Use [automation rules](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) to trigger actions based on time entries:

- **Example**: If hours spent > 8, assign task to manager for review
- **Example**: If total time exceeds budget, send notification email

### Implementing project-wide time tracking

For comprehensive time tracking across an entire process:

1. Add time fields to every task requiring measurement
2. Create a summary task at the end titled "Time Tracking Summary"  
3. Use the task description to list all time variables from previous tasks
4. Export data via [CSV](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/how-can-i-export-tallyfy-processes-to-csv/) for analysis

## Important considerations for accurate time tracking

### The reality of workplace time tracking

Getting accurate time data is harder than it seems. Here's why - and what you can do about it:

**Multi-tasking makes tracking difficult**  
People rarely work on one task at a time. Your team member might spend 30 minutes on a task, get pulled into a meeting, answer three urgent emails, then return to finish the task an hour later. Did that task take 30 minutes or 90 minutes? Both answers have merit.

**Holidays and absences skew averages**  
When calculating how long tasks typically take, holidays and vacation days throw off your numbers. A task assigned on December 23rd might sit untouched until January 2nd. That's not a 10-day task - it's a 2-hour task with an 8-day holiday in the middle.

**External delays aren't the assignee's fault**  
Sometimes tasks stall for reasons beyond anyone's control. Waiting for client feedback, dependencies on other delayed tasks, or system outages all add time that has nothing to do with how long the actual work takes.

### The clean solution: Ask for time input

The most reliable approach? Add a form field asking assignees to record their actual working time. Yes, it's one more field to fill out - but it gives you honest, clean data about how long tasks really take.

Here's why this works:
- People know exactly how much time they spent on the task (not the elapsed time)
- You capture actual effort, not calendar time
- External delays don't contaminate your data
- You can still track elapsed time separately through Tallyfy's built-in timestamps

### Analytics timestamps inherit these challenges

**Important**: The timestamps in Tallyfy Analytics and CSV exports measure elapsed time between task assignment and completion. They're subject to all the issues above - multi-tasking, holidays, external delays. That "3-day average" might actually represent 30 minutes of work spread across a long weekend. Always interpret timestamp data with this context in mind, or better yet, implement effort tracking fields for cleaner metrics.

## Best practices for time tracking

### Field naming conventions
Use consistent naming for easy reporting:
- "Task Name - Hours"
- "Task Name - Minutes"
- This makes CSV exports more readable

### Setting realistic limits
- Set maximum hours based on typical task duration
- Use validation to prevent data entry errors
- Consider using dropdown lists for standard time increments

### Training your team
- Add guidance text explaining time tracking expectations
- Specify whether to track active work time only or total elapsed time
- Clarify if breaks should be included or excluded
- Explain the difference between effort time and elapsed time

### Regular time analysis
- Export process data monthly to analyze time trends
- Identify tasks consistently taking longer than expected
- Use insights to optimize workflow design
- Consider both effort metrics and elapsed time when analyzing bottlenecks

## Common time tracking scenarios

### Billable hours tracking
For client billing, consider:
- Adding a "Billable?" radio button field (Yes/No)
- Including a "Billing Code" dropdown field
- Creating separate fields for billable vs non-billable time

### Compliance time logs
For regulatory requirements:
- Make all time fields required
- Add timestamp validation to ensure accuracy
- Include additional fields for:
  - Start time
  - End time  
  - Break duration
  - Reason for delays

### Performance metrics
To measure efficiency:
- Track both estimated and actual time
- Add fields for "Estimated Hours" and "Estimated Minutes"
- Compare estimates to actuals in your analysis

## Extracting time tracking data

### Manual CSV export
1. Open any running process with time tracking
2. Click **Settings** > **Export CSV**
3. Open in Excel/Google Sheets
4. Sum time columns for total duration

### Automated reporting via API
Use the [Tallyfy API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) to:
- Pull time data into business intelligence tools
- Create automated time reports
- Integrate with billing systems

### Real-time notifications
Configure [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) to:
- Alert when time exceeds thresholds
- Send daily time summaries
- Trigger billing system updates

## Troubleshooting time tracking

### Common issues and solutions

**Problem**: Users entering time in wrong format
**Solution**: Use dropdown fields with preset time options instead of text entry

**Problem**: Forgetting to track time
**Solution**: Make time fields required and add reminder text

**Problem**: Time entries seem inaccurate  
**Solution**: Add "Time Entry Method" field with options like "Timer", "Estimate", "Calculated"

**Problem**: Different time zones causing confusion
**Solution**: Add timezone field or standardize on UTC
