title: Ensure everyone in your team completes an approval or task

## How can I ensure everyone completes approvals or tasks?

Getting team members to finish tasks and approvals on time keeps work flowing smoothly. Tallyfy provides several features and suggests practices to encourage task completion.

### How can I use automated reminders?

Tallyfy's built-in reminders mean less manual follow-up on incomplete tasks:

- **Automated email digests**: Tallyfy automatically sends scheduled reminders based on each user's settings.
- **Customizable frequency**: Users can adjust reminder frequency in their [notification settings](/products/pro/settings/personal-settings/how-can-i-manage-email-notifications-in-tallyfy/).
- **Manual reminders**: For urgent items, you can [send immediate email reminders](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-can-i-send-email-reminders-in-tallyfy/) to assignees.

The automated nature of Tallyfy's reminders ensures regular notifications without constant manual effort.

### How can I design defined and purposeful tasks?

Clear and meaningful tasks are more likely to be completed:

- **Defined purpose**: Every task needs a clear goal and reason.
- **Appropriate scope**: Tasks should be significant but not overwhelming.
- **Defined requirements**: Explain what "done" looks like for the task.
- **Reasonable deadlines**: Set achievable deadlines allowing for quality work.

:::tip[Avoiding task fatigue]
Avoid creating too many small, minor tasks. This can lead to "approval fatigue" where people ignore notifications. Keep tasks meaningful to maintain their importance.

### How can I consolidate related approvals and tasks?

Make things easier for team members by grouping related items:

- **Bundle related approvals**: Combine multiple related approvals into one step if possible.
- **Use form fields**: Use a single form with multiple fields instead of many separate tasks for collecting information.
- **Create logical sequences**: Organize tasks to flow smoothly without repeating work.
- **Consider workload balance**: Be mindful of how many tasks you assign to individuals.

This respects colleagues' time while ensuring necessary work gets done.

### How can I follow up via comments within Tallyfy?

Tallyfy's built-in comments let you ask about task status directly:

1. Open the relevant task.
2. Add a comment in the comments section.
3. Use \@mentions (e.g., `@username`) to notify specific people.
4. Keep comments focused on the task.

Using comments creates a record of follow-up and can prompt action without needing separate emails or messages.

### How can I supplement with direct personal communication?

For critical tasks or ongoing delays, add personal communication to digital reminders:

- Schedule brief check-in calls to discuss obstacles.
- Mention task status in regular team meetings.
- Use chat/instant messaging for quick reminders.
- Meet in person (if possible) for high-priority items.

Personal connections often encourage completion, especially for important tasks.

### How can I communicate the "why" behind tasks?

People are more likely to complete tasks when they understand their importance:

- **Explain the purpose**: Clearly state why the task matters in its description.
- **Connect to larger goals**: Show how the task helps meet team or company goals.
- **Highlight impact**: Explain who benefits from the task getting done.
- **Provide context**: Include background information if it helps understanding.

When people see why their work matters, they are more motivated to do it.

### How can I implement an escalation path for persistent issues?

When tasks remain incomplete despite reminders, set up an escalation process:

- **Reassign to managers**: Use Tallyfy's edit feature to [add the team member's manager](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/edit-task/how-can-i-assign-members-to-tasks-in-tallyfy/) as an assignee.
- **Use \@mentions in comments**: Tag managers or senior members in comments to highlight the delay.
- **Implement status actions**: Use [automation rules](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/actions/status-actions/) to trigger actions (like notifications) if tasks pass deadlines.
- **Document patterns**: Track recurring issues to identify and fix underlying problems.

A documented escalation path ensures bottlenecks get attention while keeping people accountable.

### What additional strategies improve task completion?

- **Recognition and appreciation**: Thank team members who consistently complete tasks on time.
- **Performance tracking**: Use Tallyfy reports to identify patterns and address issues early.
- **Simplified interface**: Help team members focus by creating custom views of their priority tasks.
- **Training and support**: Ensure everyone knows how to use Tallyfy effectively.
- **Process optimization**: Regularly review processes to remove unnecessary tasks.

Combining Tallyfy's features with these communication and management practices can improve task completion rates significantly.
