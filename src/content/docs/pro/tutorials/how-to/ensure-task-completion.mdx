## How to ensure everyone in your team completes an approval or task

Getting team members to complete tasks and approvals on time is crucial for maintaining efficient workflows. Tallyfy offers several features and best practices to help ensure high task completion rates across your team.

### Leverage automated reminders

Tallyfy's built-in reminder system takes the burden off you for following up on incomplete tasks:

- **Automated email digests** - Tallyfy automatically sends scheduled reminders based on each user's notification preferences
- **Customizable frequency** - Team members can adjust how often they receive reminders through their [notification settings](/products/pro/settings/personal-settings/how-can-i-manage-email-notifications-in-tallyfy/)
- **Manual reminders** - For urgent tasks, you can [send immediate email reminders](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-can-i-send-email-reminders-in-tallyfy/) to all assignees

The "set and forget" nature of Tallyfy's automated reminders ensures that team members receive regular notifications about their pending tasks without requiring continuous manual follow-up.

### Design meaningful and purposeful tasks

Ensure high task completion rates by creating tasks that are substantial and valuable:

- **Clear purpose** - Every task should have a clear objective and rationale
- **Appropriate scope** - Tasks should be meaningful enough to warrant attention but not overwhelming
- **Well-defined requirements** - Clearly articulate what constitutes successful completion
- **Reasonable deadlines** - Set realistic timeframes that allow for quality work

:::tip[Avoid task fatigue]
Avoid creating excessive trivial tasks that could lead to "approval fatigue" or desensitization to task notifications. This preserves the perceived importance of tasks in your Tallyfy workflows.

### Consolidate related approvals and tasks

Reduce the burden on team members by thoughtfully grouping related items:

- **Bundle related approvals** - Combine multiple related approval points into a single step when possible
- **Use form fields** - Instead of creating separate tasks for collecting different pieces of information, use a single form with multiple fields
- **Create logical sequences** - Organize tasks so they flow naturally from one to the next without redundancy
- **Consider workload balance** - Be mindful of how many tasks are assigned to each team member

This approach respects your colleagues' time while still ensuring all necessary work is completed.

### Follow up via comments within Tallyfy

Tallyfy's native commenting system provides a convenient way to inquire about task status:

1. Open the task in question
2. Add a comment in the comments section
3. Use @mentions to notify specific team members (e.g., `@username`)
4. Keep comments constructive and supportive

Comments create a documented follow-up trail and can often prompt action without appearing as heavy-handed as direct personal outreach.

### Supplement with direct personal communication

For critical tasks or persistent delays, supplement digital reminders with personal outreach:

- Schedule brief check-in calls to discuss blockers
- Address task completion in regular team meetings
- Use instant messaging for quick reminders
- Meet in person when appropriate to emphasize importance

Personal connections often motivate completion more effectively than automated reminders alone, especially for high-priority items.

### Clearly communicate the "why" behind tasks

Team members are more likely to complete tasks when they understand their significance:

- **Explain the purpose** - Clearly articulate why the task matters in the task description
- **Connect to larger goals** - Show how the task contributes to broader team or organizational objectives
- **Highlight impact** - Explain who benefits from task completion and how
- **Provide context** - Include background information that helps assignees understand the full picture

When people understand why their contribution matters, they're more motivated to prioritize and complete the task.

### Implement an escalation path for persistent issues

When tasks remain incomplete despite reminders and follow-ups, have a clear escalation process:

- **Reassign to managers** - Use Tallyfy's editing feature to [assign the task to the team member's manager](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/edit-task/how-can-i-assign-members-to-tasks-in-tallyfy/) as an additional assignee
- **Use @mentions in comments** - Tag senior team members or management in task comments to bring attention to the delay
- **Implement status actions** - Use [automation rules](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/actions/status-actions/) to trigger notifications or processes when tasks remain incomplete after a certain period
- **Document patterns** - Track recurring completion issues to address systemic problems

Having a documented escalation path ensures that critical bottlenecks receive appropriate attention while maintaining accountability.

### Additional strategies for improving task completion

- **Recognition and appreciation** - Acknowledge team members who consistently complete tasks on time
- **Performance tracking** - Use Tallyfy's reporting features to identify completion patterns and address issues proactively
- **Simplified interface** - Create custom views to help team members easily see their highest priority tasks
- **Training and support** - Ensure all users understand how to use Tallyfy effectively to complete their tasks
- **Process optimization** - Regularly review and refine processes to eliminate unnecessary tasks

By combining Tallyfy's technical features with these human-centered approaches, you can significantly improve task completion rates across your organization.
