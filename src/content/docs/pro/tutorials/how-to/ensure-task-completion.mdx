## Ensuring task and approval completion

Tallyfy provides automated reminders, clear task definitions, and escalation paths to ensure tasks and approvals get completed on time.

### Automated reminders

Tallyfy automatically sends task reminders:

- **Automated email digests**: Tallyfy automatically sends scheduled reminders based on each user's settings.
- **Customizable frequency**: Users can adjust reminder frequency in their [notification settings](/products/pro/settings/personal-settings/how-can-i-manage-email-notifications-in-tallyfy/).
- **Manual reminders**: For urgent items, you can [send immediate email reminders](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-can-i-send-email-reminders-in-tallyfy/) to assignees.


### Creating clear tasks

Tasks need:

- **Defined purpose**: Every task needs a clear goal and reason.
- **Appropriate scope**: Tasks should be significant but not overwhelming.
- **Defined requirements**: Explain what "done" looks like for the task.
- **Reasonable deadlines**: Set achievable deadlines allowing for quality work.

:::tip[Avoiding task fatigue]
Avoid creating too many small, minor tasks. This can lead to "approval fatigue" where people ignore notifications. Keep tasks meaningful to maintain their importance.
:::

### Consolidating related work

Group related items to reduce task overload:

- **Bundle related approvals**: Combine multiple related approvals into one step if possible.
- **Use form fields**: Use a single form with multiple fields instead of many separate tasks for collecting information.
- **Create logical sequences**: Organize tasks to flow smoothly without repeating work.
- **Consider workload balance**: Be mindful of how many tasks you assign to individuals.


### Using comments for follow-up

Tallyfy's built-in comments let you ask about task status directly:

1. Open the relevant task.
2. Add a comment in the comments section.
3. Use \@mentions (e.g., `@username`) to notify specific people.
4. Keep comments focused on the task.

Comments create an audit trail and notify assignees directly within the task.

### Adding personal communication

For critical tasks or ongoing delays, add personal communication to digital reminders:

- Schedule brief check-in calls to discuss obstacles.
- Mention task status in regular team meetings.
- Use chat/instant messaging for quick reminders.
- Meet in person (if possible) for high-priority items.


### Explaining task importance

Include context in task descriptions:

- **Explain the purpose**: Clearly state why the task matters in its description.
- **Connect to larger goals**: Show how the task helps meet team or company goals.
- **Highlight impact**: Explain who benefits from the task getting done.
- **Provide context**: Include background information if it helps understanding.


### Setting up escalation paths

When tasks remain incomplete despite reminders, set up an escalation process:

- **Reassign to managers**: Use Tallyfy's edit feature to [add the team member's manager](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/edit-task/how-can-i-assign-members-to-tasks-in-tallyfy/) as an assignee.
- **Use \@mentions in comments**: Tag managers or senior members in comments to highlight the delay.
- **Implement status actions**: Use [automation rules](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/actions/status-actions/) to trigger actions (like notifications) if tasks pass deadlines.
- **Document patterns**: Track recurring issues to identify and fix underlying problems.


### Additional strategies

- **Recognition and appreciation**: Thank team members who consistently complete tasks on time.
- **Performance tracking**: Use Tallyfy reports to identify patterns and address issues early.
- **Simplified interface**: Help team members focus by creating custom views of their priority tasks.
- **Training and support**: Ensure everyone knows how to use Tallyfy effectively.
- **Process optimization**: Regularly review processes to remove unnecessary tasks.
