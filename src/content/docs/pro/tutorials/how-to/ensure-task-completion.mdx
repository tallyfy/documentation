## Getting tasks and approvals done on time

Tallyfy gives you automated reminders, clear task definitions, and escalation paths so tasks and approvals actually get completed on time.

### Automated reminders

Tallyfy sends task reminders automatically:

- **Email digests**: Scheduled reminders go out based on each user's settings.
- **Customizable frequency**: Users can adjust how often they're reminded in their [notification settings](/products/pro/settings/personal-settings/how-can-i-manage-email-notifications-in-tallyfy/).
- **Manual reminders**: For urgent items, you can [send immediate email reminders](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-can-i-send-email-reminders-in-tallyfy/) to assignees.

### Creating clear tasks

Well-defined tasks are easier to complete. Each task needs:

- **Clear purpose**: A specific goal and reason for existing.
- **Right scope**: Significant enough to matter, but not overwhelming.
- **Definition of done**: Explain what completion actually looks like.
- **Reasonable deadlines**: Achievable timelines that allow for quality work.

:::tip[Avoiding task fatigue]
Don't create too many small, minor tasks. This leads to "approval fatigue" where people start ignoring notifications. Keep tasks meaningful.

### Consolidating related work

Group related items to reduce overload and prevent [task debt](/products/pro/tutorials/how-to/how-to-avoid-task-debt/):

- **Bundle approvals**: Combine related approvals into one step when possible.
- **Use form fields**: A single form with multiple fields beats many separate tasks for collecting information.
- **Create logical sequences**: Organize tasks so they flow without repeating work.
- **Watch workload balance**: Be mindful of how many tasks you assign to each person.
- **Use expiring tasks for FYI items**: Convert informational tasks to [expiring type](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-types-of-tasks-can-i-create-with-tallyfy/) so they auto-complete if not reviewed.

### Using comments for follow-up

Tallyfy's built-in comments let you check on task status directly:

1. Open the task.
2. Add a comment.
3. Use \@mentions (e.g., `@username`) to notify specific people.
4. Keep comments focused on the task at hand.

Every comment creates an audit trail and notifies assignees right within the task.

### Adding personal communication

For critical tasks or ongoing delays, pair digital reminders with personal outreach:

- Schedule brief check-in calls to discuss obstacles.
- Bring up task status in regular team meetings.
- Use chat or instant messaging for quick nudges.
- Meet in person (if possible) for high-priority items.

### Explaining why a task matters

Include context in task descriptions so people understand the "why":

- **State the purpose**: Say clearly why this task matters.
- **Connect to goals**: Show how it helps meet team or company objectives.
- **Highlight impact**: Explain who benefits when it's done.
- **Add background**: Include relevant context if it helps understanding.

### Setting up escalation paths

When tasks stay incomplete despite reminders, escalate:

- **Reassign to managers**: Use Tallyfy's edit feature to [add the assignee's manager](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/edit-task/how-can-i-assign-members-to-tasks-in-tallyfy/) as a co-assignee.
- **\@mention in comments**: Tag managers or senior members to flag the delay.
- **Set up status actions**: Use [automation rules](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/actions/status-actions/) to trigger notifications when tasks pass deadlines.
- **Track patterns**: Log recurring issues to find and fix underlying problems.

### Other helpful strategies

- **Recognize on-time completion**: Thank team members who consistently finish tasks on time.
- **Track performance**: Use Tallyfy reports to spot patterns and address issues early.
- **Simplify the view**: Help people focus by creating custom views of their priority tasks.
- **Train your team**: Make sure everyone knows how to use Tallyfy effectively.
- **Review processes regularly**: Remove unnecessary tasks that slow things down.
