## Process improvement in Tallyfy

Tallyfy provides tools for ongoing process improvement through team feedback, analytics, and instant template updates.

### Collect improvement ideas from teams

The people doing daily tasks are your best source of improvement ideas:

- **Improvement comments**: Use Tallyfy's [built-in comments](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-report-and-resolve-issues-in-tallyfy/) to capture ideas directly within specific process steps.
- **Structured feedback**: Add feedback steps at the end of [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) to collect suggestions regularly.
- **Anonymous submissions**: Allow anonymous feedback for more honest input.
- **Idea voting**: Let team members upvote the suggestions they find most useful.

:::tip[Using contextual feedback]
Tallyfy's comments let team members suggest improvements directly on specific tasks. This gives you context on exactly where and how a process can be improved - far better than generic feedback forms.
:::

### Use customer feedback for improvements

- **Customer satisfaction surveys**: Collect feedback at key points in the customer journey.
- **Service quality metrics**: Track numbers like Net Promoter Score (NPS) or Customer Effort Score (CES).
- **Support ticket analysis**: Look for patterns in customer issues that point to process problems.
- **Direct customer interviews**: Talk to key customers about their experiences.

Focus on root causes, not symptoms. Late deliveries, for example, might signal issues in scheduling or fulfillment processes - not just shipping.

### Find bottlenecks with analytics

- **Process duration analysis**: Use Tallyfy [Analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/) to spot which steps take longer than planned.
- **Bottleneck identification**: Find steps where work regularly gets stuck or delayed.
- **Completion rate tracking**: Monitor processes with low completion or high drop-off rates.
- **Assignment analysis**: Identify overloaded team members who might be causing delays.

### Communicate why you're changing things

- **State the problem**: Define the issue the process change is meant to fix.
- **Explain the impact**: Show how the current process affects customers, team members, or results.
- **Share the vision**: Describe what the improved process will look like.
- **Connect to values**: Link the change to company values or strategic goals.

:::note[Change management basics]
Consider frameworks like Kotter's 8-Step Model or ADKAR (Awareness, Desire, Knowledge, Ability, Reinforcement). Structured approaches like these increase your chances of successful adoption.

### Deploy changes instantly

Tallyfy's template system makes rolling out improvements simple:

- **Instant updates**: Changes to [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) apply immediately - no complex versioning needed.
- **Automatic rollout**: The next process launched automatically uses the newest template version.
- **No update windows**: Make small changes anytime without scheduling downtime.
- **No version sprawl**: You won't need to manage multiple versions of the same process.


### Make incremental improvements

- **Start small**: Focus on minor improvements instead of huge overhauls.
- **Compound benefits**: Small improvements build on each other, creating big results over time.
- **Reduce resistance**: Smaller changes usually face less pushback.
- **Learn continuously**: Treat each small change as a learning opportunity for future improvements.

### Process improvement vs automation

- **Process improvement**: Making human tasks better by removing wasted effort, clarifying steps, or simplifying.
- **Process automation**: Taking people out of the loop entirely using tools like [Robotic Process Automation (RPA)](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/how-does-tallyfy-combine-rpa-systems-and-human-operators/) or [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) integrations.
- **Hybrid approaches**: [Automating](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) routine parts while improving the steps still done by people.

For any process step, ask these three questions in order:
1. Can we eliminate this step entirely?
2. If not, can we automate it?
3. If people must do it, how do we make it faster and less error-prone?


:::tip[Identifying automation candidates]
Steps that are good candidates for full automation typically:
- Follow clear rules with specific criteria
- Happen frequently or in large volumes
- Are repetitive with little variation
- Don't require much judgment
- Use structured data with clear inputs and outputs
:::

### Measure customer impact

- **Customer journey mapping**: See how process changes affect the overall customer experience.
- **Outcome metrics**: Track customer-focused numbers like satisfaction, retention, or referrals.
- **Value stream analysis**: Check whether changes affect activities that create real customer value.
- **Customer feedback loops**: Ask customers directly about the impact of process changes.


### Structured improvement methods

- **Lean**: Remove wasted effort and maximize value delivery.
- **Six Sigma**: Reduce variation and errors using data analysis.
- **Kaizen**: Make small, ongoing improvements continuously.
- **PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act)**: Test changes in small batches before full rollout.

Most organizations mix elements from different methods - and that's fine.

### Document what you changed

- **Update Tallyfy templates**: Make sure templates reflect the improved processes.
- **Record lessons learned**: Write down what worked, what didn't, and why.
- **Share success stories**: Tell others in your company about improvements and their results.
- **Create reusable patterns**: Identify successful approaches that could work for other processes.


### Balance standardization with flexibility

- **Standardize the core**: Keep the main parts of a process standard for quality and compliance.
- **Allow contextual variation**: Give teams flexibility to adapt to unique situations.
- **Define decision boundaries**: Clarify where judgment is okay and where standards must be followed.
- **Review exceptions**: Monitor when standard processes get bypassed - that's often where improvement opportunities hide.


### Additional improvement strategies

- **Process mining**: Use tools to discover how processes actually run based on system data.
- **Cross-functional input**: Get perspectives from different roles when designing improvements.
- **Pilot testing**: Test big changes on a small scale before full rollout.
- **Regular review cycles**: Schedule process reviews instead of waiting for problems to surface.
- **Training**: Make sure teams understand and can perform improved processes.
- **Recognition**: Acknowledge team members who suggest good improvements.
