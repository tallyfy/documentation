## Tracking a sales pipeline with Tallyfy

You can use Tallyfy as a lightweight CRM to track leads through your sales pipeline - no separate CRM tool needed. Create a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) where each step represents a pipeline stage, capture contact data with [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/), and monitor everything through [tracker view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/).

This works well for small teams with fewer than 50 active deals and a straightforward sales process. If you need persistent contact records or revenue forecasting, pair Tallyfy with a dedicated CRM instead - see [integrate to your CRM or ERP](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/integrate-into-crm/).

## Setting up your sales pipeline template

<Steps>
1. **Create a procedure template**
   Go to **Templates** > **Create New**. Name it "Sales Pipeline - [Your Product]".

2. **Add pipeline stages as steps**
   Each step = one stage. A typical setup: New Lead → Qualification → Discovery Call → Proposal Sent → Negotiation → Won/Lost. Adjust to match your process.

3. **Build the kick-off form**
   Add [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to capture lead data when a deal enters: Contact name, Company, Email, Phone, Deal value (number field with "$" suffix), Lead source (dropdown), and Notes.

4. **Add stage-specific fields**
   On each step, add relevant fields. For example - Qualification: "Budget confirmed?" radio button. Proposal: "Proposal amount" number field. Won/Lost: "Outcome" radio and "Lost reason" dropdown.

5. **Set assignments and deadlines**
   Assign steps to the right people using [job titles](/products/pro/documenting/templates/edit-templates/understanding-assignment-types/) for automatic routing. Add deadline rules so deals don't stall - e.g. 2 days for Qualification, 5 days for Proposal.

6. **Add conditional automations**
   Use [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) to branch your workflow. For example: if deal value > $10,000, add a manager approval step. If outcome = Lost, skip remaining steps.
</Steps>

## Managing your pipeline

[Launch a process](/products/pro/launching/) for each new lead. Open [tracker view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/) to monitor your pipeline:

- **Board view** - Columns per stage, deals as cards. Works just like a CRM pipeline board.
- **Table view** - All deals in rows with form data as columns. Sort, filter, and export to CSV.

Tallyfy sends automatic deadline reminders so deals keep moving. Set up [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) to escalate overdue deals to a manager.

## Reporting on your pipeline

- **CSV export** - Export from tracker view into Excel or Google Sheets for pivot tables and win rate analysis.
- **Tallyfy Analytics** - [Analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/) copies data to Amazon Athena for BI tools (Tableau, Power BI, Looker). Build dashboards for stage duration, win/loss ratios, and rep performance.
- **Time tracking** - Add number fields for reps to log hours per deal. See [track time on tasks](/products/pro/tutorials/how-to/track-time-in-tasks/).

## Limitations vs. a dedicated CRM

Tallyfy is a workflow tool, not a full CRM. You won't get persistent contact records across deals, revenue forecasting, email open/click tracking, or advanced lead scoring.

When you outgrow the lightweight approach, connect Tallyfy to Salesforce, HubSpot, or similar through [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/). Tallyfy then handles the operational workflows between CRM stages.
