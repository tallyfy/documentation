## Tracking a sales pipeline with Tallyfy

Tallyfy can work as a lightweight CRM for small teams with simple sales processes. Create a procedure template where each step is a pipeline stage, capture lead data with kick-off form fields, and monitor deals through tracker view. Best for fewer than 50 active deals. For persistent contact records or revenue forecasting, pair Tallyfy with a dedicated CRM - /products/pro/integrations/middleware/integrate-into-crm/

<Steps>
1. **Create a template** with stages as steps - e.g. New Lead → Qualification → Proposal → Negotiation → Won/Lost.

2. **Add kick-off form fields** to capture lead data - contact name, company, email, phone, deal value (number field), lead source (dropdown). See /products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/

3. **Add stage-specific fields** on each step - e.g. "Budget confirmed?" radio on Qualification, "Proposal amount" number on Proposal, "Outcome" and "Lost reason" on Won/Lost.

4. **Set assignments and deadlines** using job titles for automatic routing, with deadline rules per stage. See /products/pro/documenting/templates/edit-templates/understanding-assignment-types/

5. **Add automations** to branch based on conditions - e.g. if deal value > $10,000 add manager approval, if Lost skip remaining steps. See /products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/
</Steps>

## Managing and reporting

Launch a process per new lead, then use tracker view ( /products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/ ) to monitor your pipeline - board view shows columns per stage, table view shows all deals with form data as sortable columns.

- **CSV export** from tracker view for Excel/Sheets analysis
- **Tallyfy Analytics** copies data to Amazon Athena for BI tools - /products/pro/integrations/analytics/
- **Time tracking** via number fields on tasks - /products/pro/tutorials/how-to/track-time-in-tasks/

Tallyfy isn't a full CRM - you won't get persistent contact records, revenue forecasting, or email tracking. When you outgrow this approach, connect to Salesforce or HubSpot via middleware - /products/pro/integrations/middleware/
