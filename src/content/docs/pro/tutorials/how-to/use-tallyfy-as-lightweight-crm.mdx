## Tracking a sales pipeline with Tallyfy

You can use Tallyfy as a lightweight CRM to track leads through your sales pipeline - without paying for a separate CRM tool. Create a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) where each step represents a pipeline stage, use [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to capture contact and deal data, and monitor everything through Tallyfy's [tracker view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/).

This approach works well for small teams, startups, and businesses with a straightforward sales process. You get deal tracking, task assignments, and a visual pipeline board - all inside a tool you're already using for workflows.

### When this makes sense

A Tallyfy-based pipeline fits if you:
- Have fewer than 50 active deals at any given time
- Follow a consistent sales process with clear stages
- Don't need revenue forecasting or contact history across multiple deals
- Want your sales workflow to include operational tasks (proposals, approvals, onboarding) in the same place

If you need persistent contact records, deal analytics, or multi-pipeline management, pair Tallyfy with a dedicated CRM instead - see [integrate to your CRM or ERP](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/integrate-into-crm/).

## Setting up your sales pipeline template

<Steps>
1. **Create a new procedure template**
   Go to the **Templates** tab and click **Create New**. Name it something like "Sales Pipeline - [Your Product/Service]". This template becomes the blueprint for every deal you track.

2. **Add your pipeline stages as steps**
   Each step in the template represents a stage in your sales process. A typical setup:
   - **Step 1: New lead** - Capture initial contact details
   - **Step 2: Qualification** - Research the lead and confirm fit
   - **Step 3: Discovery call** - Schedule and complete the first call
   - **Step 4: Proposal sent** - Prepare and deliver your proposal
   - **Step 5: Negotiation** - Handle objections, adjust terms
   - **Step 6: Won / Lost** - Close the deal or mark it lost

   Adjust these stages to match your actual process. Some teams need 4 steps, others need 8. Don't overcomplicate it.

3. **Build the kick-off form for lead data**
   Add [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to your kick-off form to capture lead information when a deal enters the pipeline:
   - **Contact name** (Short Text, required)
   - **Company** (Short Text, required)
   - **Email** (Short Text with email validation)
   - **Phone** (Short Text)
   - **Deal value** (Short Text with number validation, suffix: "$")
   - **Lead source** (Dropdown: Website, Referral, Cold Outreach, Event, Partner)
   - **Notes** (Long Text)

4. **Add task-specific form fields to each stage**
   On individual steps, add fields relevant to that stage. For example:
   - **Qualification step**: "Company size" dropdown, "Budget confirmed?" radio button, "Decision maker identified?" radio button
   - **Proposal step**: "Proposal amount" number field, "Proposal sent date" date field
   - **Won/Lost step**: "Outcome" radio button (Won/Lost), "Lost reason" dropdown (if applicable)

5. **Set up assignments**
   Assign each step to the right person. If you have a small sales team, assign individuals directly. For larger teams, use [job titles](/products/pro/documenting/templates/edit-templates/understanding-assignment-types/) so the right sales rep gets tasks automatically.

6. **Add deadline rules**
   Set reasonable deadlines for each stage. For example, "Qualification" might have a 2-day deadline, while "Proposal sent" gets 5 days. This prevents deals from stalling silently in your pipeline.

7. **Configure conditional automations**
   Use [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) to branch your workflow:
   - If "Deal value" > $10,000, add a manager approval step
   - If "Outcome" = Lost, skip remaining steps and assign a follow-up task
   - If "Lead source" = Partner, notify the partnerships team

8. **Save and test**
   Save the template, then launch a test process to walk through each stage. Verify all form fields work and automations trigger correctly.
</Steps>

## Managing your pipeline day-to-day

### Launching new deals

Every time a new lead comes in, [launch a process](/products/pro/launching/) from your sales pipeline template. Fill in the kick-off form with the lead's details and it enters your pipeline immediately.

For inbound leads, you can even set up a [kick-off form](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/) that launches the pipeline automatically when someone submits lead details.

### Monitoring with tracker view

Open the [tracker view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/) for your sales pipeline template. You get two powerful views:

- **Board view** - Each column represents a pipeline stage. Deals appear as cards you can scan at a glance. This is your visual pipeline, similar to what you'd see in a CRM.
- **Table view** - See all deals in rows with form field data as columns. Sort by deal value, filter by stage, or export to CSV for reporting.

Tracker view is where you'll spend most of your time. It gives you the bird's-eye perspective on where every deal stands.

### Keeping deals moving

Tallyfy automatically sends task notifications and deadline reminders to the assigned salesperson. If a deal stalls at a particular stage, the assignee gets nudged. You can also set up [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) to escalate overdue deals to a sales manager.

## Generating sales reports

### CSV export for quick analysis

From the tracker view, export your pipeline data to CSV. Open it in Excel or Google Sheets to create pivot tables, calculate win rates, or analyze deal velocity by stage.

### Tallyfy Analytics for deeper insights

[Tallyfy Analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/) copies your workflow data to Amazon Athena, where you can connect business intelligence tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Looker. With Analytics, you can build dashboards showing:
- Average time deals spend in each stage
- Win/loss ratios by lead source
- Pipeline value over time
- Sales rep performance comparisons

### Tracking time spent per deal

Want to know how much time your team spends on each deal? Add number fields to each stage for reps to log hours. See [track time on tasks](/products/pro/tutorials/how-to/track-time-in-tasks/) for the setup details.

## What Tallyfy won't replace

Be realistic about the limitations. Tallyfy is a workflow tool, not a dedicated CRM. Here's what you won't get:

- **Persistent contact records** - Each deal is a separate process. There's no unified contact profile tracking all interactions across deals.
- **Revenue forecasting** - No built-in weighted pipeline or revenue projection tools.
- **Email tracking** - Tallyfy doesn't monitor email opens, clicks, or thread history with contacts.
- **Multiple pipelines per contact** - You can't easily see all deals related to one company in a single view.
- **Advanced lead scoring** - No automated scoring based on engagement signals.

If you outgrow the lightweight approach, connect Tallyfy to a real CRM like Salesforce or HubSpot through [middleware integrations](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/). Your sales process templates in Tallyfy then handle the detailed operational workflows between CRM pipeline stages - the best of both worlds.

## Example: freelance consulting pipeline

Here's a concrete example for a freelancer or small consultancy:

**Template name**: "Client Acquisition Pipeline"

**Kick-off form fields**: Client name, Company, Email, Service needed (dropdown), Estimated budget (number), How they found us (dropdown)

**Steps**:
1. **Initial contact** (1-day deadline) - Review inquiry, research the company, prepare talking points
2. **Discovery meeting** (3-day deadline) - Schedule and run the call, document requirements in a Long Text field
3. **Scope and quote** (5-day deadline) - Build the proposal, add "Quoted amount" number field, attach proposal document
4. **Client review** (7-day deadline) - Follow up, address questions, negotiate terms
5. **Decision** - "Outcome" radio button (Won/Lost/Deferred), "Start date" if won, "Lost reason" dropdown if lost
6. **Onboarding kick-off** (conditional - only if Won) - Schedule onboarding, send welcome email, assign project team

This gives you a repeatable sales process with accountability, deadlines, and data capture - without paying for CRM software.
