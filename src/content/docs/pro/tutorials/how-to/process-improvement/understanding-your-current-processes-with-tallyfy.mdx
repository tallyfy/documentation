title: Understand your current processes with Tallyfy
---

## Documenting existing workflows is the starting point

Effective process improvement always begins with a clear understanding of your current state. After all, you can't effectively improve what you don't thoroughly understand. Many office workflows suffer from being undocumented, vaguely defined, or existing only as "tribal knowledge" passed down informally. This lack of clarity is a major barrier to improvement.

### Why document your processes?

Taking the time to make your processes explicit offers several key advantages:

-   **Clarity and Consistency**: Everyone knows the right way to do things, leading to more consistent outcomes.
-   **Effective Training**: Documented processes are invaluable for onboarding new team members quickly.
-   **Baseline for Improvement**: A clear "as-is" process provides the foundation upon which improvements can be measured and built.
-   **Identifying Inefficiencies**: Often, the very act of documenting a process reveals redundancies, bottlenecks, or unnecessary steps.

Traditionally, this involved creating detailed flowcharts or process maps. While these can be useful, they often become complex, quickly outdated, and are typically created by specialists, making them less accessible to the people actually doing the work.

### The Tallyfy advantage for understanding processes

Tallyfy offers a refreshingly modern and straightforward way to understand and document your processes:

-   **No complex flowcharts needed**: With Tallyfy, you don't need to be a flowchart expert. You define your process by simply listing the steps in order, assigning roles, adding rules, and embedding instructions. The Tallyfy template *becomes* your process map â€“ clear, actionable, and easy for anyone to understand.
-   **Living documentation**: Unlike static documents that gather dust, Tallyfy templates are dynamic. When you run a process from a template, you're executing the live, current version. This means your documentation is always up-to-date.
-   **AI-powered process capture**: Getting started is even easier with Tallyfy's AI capabilities. You can describe a process in plain language, or even upload existing documents (like old Word files or checklists), and Tallyfy's AI will help generate a first draft of your process template. This overcomes the "blank page" hurdle and gets your process into a structured format quickly.

:::tip[Visualize your workflow with "Process Stapling"]
Imagine an order or a request physically moving through your office. "Process Stapling" is a technique where you mentally (or even physically, with a printout) follow that item from start to finish, noting every person it touches and every action taken. As you do this, you can directly input these steps into a Tallyfy template, quickly capturing the real flow of work.

### Key information to capture in Tallyfy

As you document your existing processes in Tallyfy, think about the core components of any workflow. A simple framework like **SIPOC** (Suppliers, Inputs, Process, Outputs, Customers) can help, even without formal diagramming:

-   **Process Steps**: These are the individual tasks in your Tallyfy template.
-   **Inputs**: What information, documents, or resources are needed for each step? These can be captured in Tallyfy form fields or as attachments.
-   **Outputs**: What does each step produce? What is the final outcome of the process?
-   **Suppliers (of inputs)**: Who or what system provides the inputs for each step?
-   **Customers (of outputs)**: Who receives the output of each step, and who is the ultimate customer of the overall process?
-   **Roles and Responsibilities**: Tallyfy's assignee feature makes it clear who is responsible for each step.

By structuring your template in Tallyfy, you inherently define who does what, when, and with what information. This clarity itself is a form of process understanding.

### Gaining initial insights

Once your process is documented in a Tallyfy template, even before launching it, you and your team can often spot initial pain points or areas needing clarification. Reviewing the steps, assignees, and embedded instructions can spark immediate discussions.

:::note[Use comments for early feedback]
As you're documenting an existing process into a Tallyfy template, encourage your team to use the **comment feature** on steps where they have questions, notice inconsistencies with current practice, or see immediate small improvement opportunities. This captures valuable insights right from the start.

Understanding your current processes is the bedrock of any successful improvement effort. Tallyfy simplifies this crucial first phase, empowering you to move quickly from undocumented workflows to clear, actionable, and improvable processes.
