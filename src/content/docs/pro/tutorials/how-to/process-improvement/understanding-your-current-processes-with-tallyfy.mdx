title: Understanding your current processes

## Why is documenting existing workflows the starting point?

You can't improve what you don't understand. Many office workflows are undocumented, vaguely defined, or exist only as "tribal knowledge" passed down informally. That's a major barrier to improvement.

### Why should I document my processes?

Making your processes explicit gives you:

-   **Clarity and consistency** - Everyone knows the right way to do things, producing more consistent outcomes.
-   **Faster training** - Documented processes help onboard new team members quickly.
-   **A baseline for improvement** - A clear "as-is" process lets you measure changes against something concrete.
-   **Visible inefficiencies** - The act of documenting a process often reveals redundancies, bottlenecks, or unnecessary steps.

Traditional approaches involve detailed flowcharts or process maps. These often become complex, quickly outdated, and are typically created by specialists - making them less accessible to the people actually doing the work.

### What advantages does Tallyfy offer for understanding processes?

Tallyfy gives you a straightforward way to understand and document your processes:

-   **No flowcharts needed** - You define your process by listing steps in order, assigning roles, adding rules, and embedding instructions. The Tallyfy template *becomes* your process map - clear, practical, and easy for anyone to understand.
-   **Living documentation** - Unlike static documents that gather dust, Tallyfy templates are dynamic. When you run a process from a template, you're executing the live, current version. Your documentation stays up-to-date automatically.
-   **AI-powered process capture** - Describe a process in plain language, or upload existing documents (like old Word files or checklists), and Tallyfy's AI will generate a first draft of your template. This overcomes the "blank page" hurdle and gets your process into a structured format quickly.

:::tip[Visualize your workflow with "Process Stapling"]
Imagine an order or request physically moving through your office. "Process Stapling" means you follow that item from start to finish - noting every person it touches and every action taken. As you do this, input these steps directly into a Tallyfy template to capture the real flow of work.

### What key information should I capture in Tallyfy?

Use the **SIPOC** framework (Suppliers, Inputs, Process, Outputs, Customers) to guide what you capture - even without formal diagramming:

-   **Process steps** - The individual tasks in your Tallyfy template.
-   **Inputs** - What information, documents, or resources does each step need? Capture these in Tallyfy form fields or as attachments.
-   **Outputs** - What does each step produce? What's the final outcome?
-   **Suppliers (of inputs)** - Who or what system provides the inputs for each step?
-   **Customers (of outputs)** - Who receives each step's output, and who's the ultimate customer of the overall process?
-   **Roles and responsibilities** - Tallyfy's assignee feature makes it clear who's responsible for each step.

### How can I gain initial insights from process documentation?

Even before launching a documented process, reviewing the steps, assignees, and instructions with your team can reveal pain points and spark improvement discussions.

:::note[Use comments for early feedback]
While documenting a process into a Tallyfy template, encourage your team to use the **comment feature** on steps where they have questions, notice inconsistencies, or see quick improvement opportunities. This captures valuable insights from the start.
