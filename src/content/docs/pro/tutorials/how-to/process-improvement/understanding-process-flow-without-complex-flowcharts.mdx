title: Understand process flow without flowcharts
---

## How can I visualize how work moves using Tallyfy templates?

**Process flow** is the sequence of steps, activities, and handoffs that transform inputs into outputs. Understanding this flow helps you find bottlenecks, delays, and areas for improvement. Tallyfy offers a more intuitive way to visualize and manage your workflow than traditional diagrams.

### Why is understanding process flow important?

A clear view of your process flow helps you:

-   **Find bottlenecks** - Pinpoint where work piles up or slows down.
-   **Spot delays and queues** - See where tasks wait too long before someone acts on them.
-   **Recognize inefficient handoffs** - Understand if transitions between team members or departments are smooth or problematic.
-   **Eliminate unnecessary steps** - Identify activities that don't add value.
-   **Reduce cycle time** - Shorten the path work takes from start to finish.

### How does Tallyfy's approach compare to traditional flowcharts?

Detailed flowcharts and Value Stream Maps (VSMs) work well in complex manufacturing settings. But for office and service-based processes, they're often too complicated to create, maintain, and understand.

**Tallyfy simplifies process flow:**

1.  **Define sequentially** - When you [create a template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/edit-templates/), you're defining the process flow. Each step follows the previous one, with clear assignments and optional deadlines.
2.  **Visualize in action** - Once a [process is launched](/products/pro/launching/), the **[Tracker view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** and the **[process status page](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/how-can-i-manage-and-track-my-processes-on-tallyfy/)** show real-time progress. You see completed steps, the current active step, and what's coming next.
3.  **Handoffs are clear** - Task assignments show who's responsible for each part of the flow. When one person completes their task, it automatically moves to the next assignee.

### How can I identify flow issues in Tallyfy?

Because your processes are live and tracked in Tallyfy, spotting flow problems is straightforward:

-   **[Tracker view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** - This board gives you a bird's-eye view of all active processes. Look for steps where many tasks pile up - those are your bottlenecks.
-   **[Tallyfy Analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/)** - Check the data for:
    -   Average time per step: Steps with significantly longer durations are potential constraints.
    -   Overdue tasks: Many overdue tasks at one step signals a flow problem.
-   **[Task comments](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-report-and-resolve-issues-in-tallyfy/)** - Frequent comments about delays, missing information, or confusion at a specific step indicate flow issues.

### What simple strategies can improve process flow in Tallyfy?

Once you've found areas for improvement, Tallyfy makes it easy to adjust the flow:

-   **Reorder steps** - If a sequence is illogical or causing delays, drag and drop steps in your template editor.
-   **Clarify instructions** - Ambiguity causes delays. Make instructions within Tallyfy tasks crystal clear.
-   **Use [conditional logic (rules)](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/logic-explained/)** - Automate routing to skip unnecessary steps based on specific criteria.
-   **Improve handoffs** - When a task moves between assignees, make sure all necessary information is available in the Tallyfy task. This cuts delays from information-seeking.
-   **Use parallel steps** - If activities can happen simultaneously, configure them as parallel steps in Tallyfy to speed up the overall process.
