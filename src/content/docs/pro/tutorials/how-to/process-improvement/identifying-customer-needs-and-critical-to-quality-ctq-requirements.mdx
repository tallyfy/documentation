title: Identify customer needs and CTQ requirements
---

## Translating customer needs into measurable goals

Process improvement works best when it's focused on what actually matters to your customers. Before improving a process, you need to understand their needs, expectations, and what they value. This means capturing the **Voice of the Customer (VOC)** and turning it into measurable **Critical to Quality (CTQ)** requirements.

### Capturing the Voice of the Customer (VOC)

VOC is the collective needs, expectations, and feedback your customers express about your products, services, or processes. Here are common ways to listen in an office or service environment:

-   **Surveys**: Collect feedback on satisfaction, specific process touchpoints, or overall experience.
-   **Interviews**: Run one-on-one discussions with a representative sample of customers to uncover their perspectives and pain points.
-   **Feedback forms**: Embed simple feedback mechanisms within your Tallyfy processes or at the end of service delivery.
-   **Support tickets and complaints**: Analyze patterns in customer issues - they often point directly to process gaps.
-   **Social media and review sites**: Monitor what customers say about you publicly.
-   **Sales and account management teams**: Frontline teams often have valuable insights into customer sentiment and needs.

:::note[Focus on listening]
When gathering VOC, the goal is to *listen* and understand - not to defend current processes or jump to solutions. Ask open-ended questions and probe for underlying needs.

### Understanding customer needs with the Kano Model

Not all customer needs carry the same weight. The Kano Model helps you prioritize by categorizing them:

-   **Must-bes (basic expectations)**: Unspoken requirements customers absolutely expect. Missing them causes extreme dissatisfaction - but meeting them doesn't increase satisfaction. They're just the baseline. *Example: In a Tallyfy-managed onboarding process, a **Must-be** is that all required legal documents are correctly processed.*
-   **One-dimensionals (performance needs)**: The more you deliver, the more satisfied customers become (and vice-versa). Customers are usually vocal about these. *Example: The faster the onboarding process completes in Tallyfy, the happier the client.*
-   **Delighters (excitement needs)**: Unexpected positives that create a "wow" effect. Customers don't ask for these. *Example: Proactively sending a personalized welcome kit halfway through the Tallyfy onboarding process could be a **Delighter**.*

Knowing where your process outcomes fall on the Kano Model helps you maintain Must-bes, excel at One-dimensionals, and strategically add Delighters.

### Defining Critical to Quality (CTQ) requirements

CTQs translate qualitative customer needs into specific, measurable process characteristics. They bridge the gap between what customers say they want and what your processes need to deliver.

Good CTQs are SMART:

-   **S**pecific: Clearly defined and unambiguous.
-   **M**easurable: You can quantify performance against them.
-   **A**chievable: It's possible to meet the requirement.
-   **R**elevant: Directly linked to a customer need and business goal.
-   **T**ime-bound: Has a timeframe or frequency associated with it (if applicable).

For example:
-   **VOC**: "I need my support query resolved quickly."
-   **CTQ**: "Resolve 95% of urgent support tickets within 4 business hours."

A **CTQ Tree** is a visual tool that breaks down broad customer needs into granular, measurable CTQs. Start with a general need, then ask "what does that mean?" or "how would we measure that?" to get specific.

### Designing Tallyfy processes around CTQs

Once you've identified your CTQs, design or modify your processes so they consistently meet these requirements. Tallyfy helps you build processes with CTQs front and center:

-   **Set deadlines**: Define task and process deadlines in Tallyfy based on customer-driven CTQs for speed and timeliness.
-   **Use form fields**: Capture precise customer requirements or critical data points directly within Tallyfy tasks using [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/).
-   **Embed clear instructions**: Meet quality-related CTQs by providing detailed instructions, checklists, or video guides within Tallyfy tasks.
-   **Track performance**: Use Tallyfy's real-time tracking and [analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/) to monitor whether your processes consistently hit CTQ targets (e.g., on-time completion, error rates).

:::tip[Customer feedback in Tallyfy]
Add a dedicated step in your Tallyfy [customer-facing templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) (like order fulfillment or service delivery) to request feedback. Tailor questions to gather input on aspects tied to your key CTQs.
