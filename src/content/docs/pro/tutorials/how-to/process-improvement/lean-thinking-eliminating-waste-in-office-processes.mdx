title: Lean thinking - eliminate waste in office processes
---

## Applying lean principles in office work

Lean thinking maximizes customer value while minimizing waste. It started in manufacturing (famously at Toyota), but its principles work just as well for office and service processes. The core idea is eliminating "Muda" - the Japanese term for waste - meaning any activity that burns resources without creating value for the customer.

Toyota's Taiichi Ohno put it simply: "All we are doing is looking at a timeline from the moment the customer gives us an order to the point when we collect the cash. And we are reducing that timeline by removing the non-value adding wastes." That mindset changes how you see every process - from invoice handling to customer onboarding.

### Customer value definition

Before eliminating waste, you need to understand what your customer actually values. Value is what the customer would pay for - what meets their explicit and implicit needs. Any step that doesn't contribute to this value is potentially waste. (See [Identifying customer needs and CTQ requirements](/products/pro/tutorials/how-to/process-improvement/identifying-customer-needs-and-critical-to-quality-ctq-requirements/) for more.)

### The 8 wastes (TIM WOODS) in office contexts

Lean practitioners use the acronym **TIM WOODS** for the eight categories of waste. Here's how each one shows up in office and service environments:

1.  **T - Transportation**: Unnecessary movement of information, documents, or people for approvals and handoffs.
    *   *Office example*: Emailing document drafts back and forth for review instead of using a Tallyfy task with files attached. Routing a physical document through multiple departments for signatures when an e-signature step would do.
    *   *Tallyfy helps*: Centralizes information and tasks so you don't move data between systems unnecessarily. Clear assignments minimize misrouted work.

2.  **I - Inventory**: Excess work-in-progress, task backlogs, unread emails, outdated reports, or too many pending approvals.
    *   *Office example*: A manager's inbox clogged with hundreds of approval requests. A large queue of unprocessed customer applications.
    *   *Tallyfy helps*: Gives visibility into workloads and queues via the [Tracker view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/). Deadlines and automated reminders keep work flowing.

3.  **M - Motion**: Unnecessary physical movements (walking to a shared printer repeatedly) or digital movements (excessive clicks, navigating complex folder structures, switching between applications).
    *   *Office example*: Searching across shared drives and email chains to find client information. Opening and closing different apps to copy-paste data.
    *   *Tallyfy helps*: Puts all task-relevant information, instructions, and forms in one place. Integrations automate data transfer, cutting down on app switching.

4.  **W - Waiting**: Idle time waiting for information, approvals, decisions, or a previous step to finish.
    *   *Office example*: A project stalled because a decision-maker is unavailable. An employee stuck waiting for data from another department.
    *   *Tallyfy helps*: Automated notifications alert assignees when tasks are ready. Deadlines and task status visibility help spot and reduce wait times. You can configure parallel steps for tasks that should happen simultaneously. To measure working time versus waiting time, see [how to track time spent on tasks](/products/pro/tutorials/how-to/track-time-in-tasks/).

5.  **O - Overproduction**: Doing more work than needed, sooner than needed, or in greater quantities than needed - like creating reports nobody reads.
    *   *Office example*: Generating a daily detailed sales report when management only reviews a weekly summary. Preparing a full proposal before qualifying the client.
    *   *Tallyfy helps*: Processes launch on demand. [Conditional logic (rules)](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/logic-explained/) ensures only necessary steps activate, preventing premature work.

6.  **O - Over-processing**: Putting more effort into a task than the customer values - unnecessary checks, excessive reviews, or multiple approval layers for minor items.
    *   *Office example*: Requiring three management sign-offs for a minor supply order. Reformatting a document repeatedly to satisfy slightly different internal preferences.
    *   *Tallyfy helps*: Simplifies approvals with clear assignment. Standardized templates reduce unnecessary variations. Conditional logic can skip approval steps based on defined criteria.

7.  **D - Defects**: Errors that require correction - rework, delays, and unhappy customers. Data entry mistakes, incorrect calculations, miscommunications.
    *   *Office example*: An invoice sent with the wrong amount. A marketing email deployed with broken links or typos.
    *   *Tallyfy helps*: Clear instructions, checklists, and [form fields with validation](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) within tasks help prevent errors. Standardized processes reduce defects from inconsistent methods.

8.  **S - Skills (non-utilized talent)**: Failing to use your team's knowledge, creativity, and experience. Also includes assigning tasks to people without the right skills or burdening skilled workers with mundane work.
    *   *Office example*: Not involving frontline staff in process improvement discussions. A senior analyst spending hours on basic data compilation that could be automated.
    *   *Tallyfy helps*: Clear role assignments ensure tasks go to the right people. [Improvement comments](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-report-and-resolve-issues-in-tallyfy/) let everyone contribute ideas.

Review your Tallyfy templates step by step. For each one, ask your team: "Does this step show any of the TIM WOODS wastes from the customer's perspective or from an efficiency standpoint?"

### The five lean principles

Lean thinking rests on five principles that work together:

1. **Specify value from the customer's standpoint**: Start every process design by asking "What would the customer pay for?" A mortgage application adds value when gathering necessary information - not when documents sit in queues between departments.

2. **Map the value stream**: Document every step from request to delivery. You'll likely find that value-adding time is a small fraction of total cycle time. Many organizations discover their multi-week approval processes contain only minutes of actual work.

3. **Create flow**: Arrange work so it moves without interruption. Break down departmental silos, reduce batch sizes, and eliminate wait times. When organizations reorganize from departmental queues to case-based teams, processing time typically drops significantly.

4. **Establish pull**: Let customer demand trigger work, not arbitrary schedules. Instead of processing invoices in weekly batches (causing delays early in the week and rushes at the end), process them as they arrive. Tallyfy's on-demand process launching naturally creates pull.

5. **Pursue perfection through continuous improvement**: Each improvement reveals new opportunities. Toyota calls this "kaizen" - the relentless pursuit of better ways. Small daily improvements compound into dramatic results.

### Advanced lean concepts for knowledge work

**Heijunka (level loading)**: Smooth out workload peaks and valleys. Instead of Monday morning chaos and Friday afternoon lulls, distribute work evenly. HR teams often cut overtime by spreading interview scheduling throughout the week rather than clustering on specific days.

**Standard work for variable processes**: Office work seems too variable to standardize? Think again. Create flexible standards - like interview templates with core questions plus role-specific additions. You get consistency while still allowing necessary variation.

**Visual management**: Make work status instantly visible. Tallyfy's tracker view acts as a digital andon board, showing exactly where work stands without asking anyone. When problems can't hide, they get solved faster.

### Using Tallyfy to combat office waste

Making your processes visible, standardized, and executable in Tallyfy makes waste easier to spot and eliminate.

Tallyfy naturally embeds lean principles:
- **Built-in pull system**: Processes launch on demand, not by schedule
- **Automatic flow**: Tasks route instantly to the next person without manual handoffs
- **Standard work made easy**: Templates ensure everyone follows best practices
- **Continuous improvement built in**: Comments and analytics reveal improvement opportunities
