title: Gather data and use Tallyfy Analytics

## Use data and analytics to guide improvements

Good process improvement runs on facts, not guesswork. Data shows you how processes actually perform, where real problems exist, and whether changes make a difference.

### Why data is essential

-   **Manages by fact**: Data replaces assumptions with objective evidence.
-   **Identifies real problems**: Helps distinguish symptoms from root causes.
-   **Baselines performance**: You need to know where you are to measure progress.
-   **Pinpoints bottlenecks**: Shows where work gets stuck or takes too long.
-   **Measures impact**: Validates whether changes had the desired effect.

### What data should you collect?

Align your data collection with **Critical to Quality (CTQ)** requirements - what your customers value - and overall process performance. There are two main types:

-   **Output measures (Y variables)**: Results and outcomes of your process.
    -   Customer satisfaction scores (e.g., NPS, CSAT)
    -   Error rates or defect counts (e.g., incorrect invoices)
    -   On-time delivery percentage
    -   Total process completion time (cycle time)
-   **Process measures (X variables)**: In-process metrics that influence outputs.
    -   Time taken for individual steps
    -   Rework rates at specific points
    -   Queue or waiting times between steps
    -   Number of approvals required

A simple **Data Collection Plan** helps - even a basic checklist answering: What to collect? Why? How? When/how often? Where in the process? Who's responsible?

### How Tallyfy helps gather process data

Manual data collection is time-consuming and error-prone. **[Tallyfy Analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/)** is an add-on service where you connect your own BI tools to analyze workflow data that Tallyfy captures automatically, including:

-   **Task completion times**: How long each step takes (based on timestamps - for actual effort time, see [how to track time spent on tasks](/products/pro/tutorials/how-to/track-time-in-tasks/)).
-   **Overall process duration**: Total end-to-end time for each process instance.
-   **User workload and performance**: How tasks are distributed and completed across team members.
-   **Overdue tasks**: Tasks and processes falling behind schedule.
-   **Step-by-step bottlenecks**: Where work consistently slows down.

### Using Tallyfy Analytics to find improvement opportunities

Regularly reviewing data from [Tallyfy Analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/) in your BI tools reveals where to focus:

-   **Identify bottlenecks**: Spot steps that consistently take longer than others. Why is this step slow? Can it be simplified, resourced differently, or automated?
-   **Track cycle times**: Monitor average completion time for entire processes. Increasing or highly variable cycle times signal a need for improvement.
-   **Monitor on-time completion**: Check if processes and tasks meet their deadlines. High overdue rates point to workload, complexity, or unrealistic deadline issues.
-   **Understand workload distribution**: Find team members who are consistently overloaded - this leads to delays and burnout. Consider reassigning tasks or redesigning parts of the process.

:::tip[Be proactive with analytics]
Don't wait for problems to become critical. Schedule regular reviews (e.g., weekly or monthly) to catch emerging issues early.

### Visualizing data for clearer insights

Raw numbers are hard to interpret. Charts and graphs make trends, patterns, and outliers clear. Tallyfy Analytics lets you connect BI tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Looker for custom visualizations. Two useful chart types:

-   **Run charts**: Plot a metric (like task completion time) over time to reveal trends or seasonal patterns.
-   **Pareto charts**: Identify the "vital few" causes of a problem (e.g., the 20% of error types causing 80% of rework).

When Tallyfy data shows tasks frequently stuck at one step, or comments indicating confusion there, that's a clear signal. The process likely needs simpler instructions, extra resources, or a redesign.

You can also export process data for more advanced analysis if your needs are very specific, but for most day-to-day process improvement, Tallyfy Analytics is a strong starting point.
