title: Measuring process performance with sigma levels
---

## What are sigma levels and why do they matter?

Sigma levels quantify process performance by measuring defects per million opportunities (DPMO). This universal metric enables meaningful comparisons across different processes - from invoice accuracy to on-time delivery. Understanding sigma levels helps you set realistic improvement targets based on world-class benchmarks rather than arbitrary percentages.

Most organizations operate between 2 and 4 sigma. At 3 sigma (93.3% defect-free), you might think performance is good. Yet this means 66,807 defects per million opportunities. For a hospital, that's unacceptable medication errors. For a bank, it's thousands of incorrect transactions. The journey to higher sigma levels transforms "good enough" into genuine excellence.

### Understanding the sigma scale

The sigma scale uses standard deviations to measure how well a process meets customer requirements:

- **1 Sigma**: 31% successful (690,000 DPMO) - Barely functional
- **2 Sigma**: 69% successful (308,537 DPMO) - Significant errors 
- **3 Sigma**: 93.3% successful (66,807 DPMO) - Typical performance
- **4 Sigma**: 99.38% successful (6,210 DPMO) - Good performance
- **5 Sigma**: 99.977% successful (233 DPMO) - Excellent performance
- **6 Sigma**: 99.99966% successful (3.4 DPMO) - World class

### The real impact of sigma levels

Consider everyday examples to grasp the dramatic differences:

At **99% quality (3.8 sigma)**:
- 20,000 lost articles of mail per hour
- 5,000 incorrect surgical operations per week
- 2 short or long landings at major airports daily

At **99.99966% quality (6 sigma)**:
- 7 lost articles of mail per hour
- 1.7 incorrect surgical operations per week
- 1 short or long landing every 5 years

The difference? Customer trust, operational costs, and competitive advantage.

### How to calculate your process sigma

Calculating sigma levels requires understanding three key concepts:

1. **Defect opportunities**: Each customer requirement represents an opportunity for defects. An invoice might have 5 opportunities - correct amount, right address, accurate items, proper formatting, timely delivery.

2. **Defects vs. defectives**: A defective unit may have multiple defects. One incorrect invoice (defective) might have wrong amount AND wrong address (two defects).

3. **Sample size matters**: Ensure your data represents typical performance, not best-case or worst-case scenarios.

**The calculation**:
1. Count total defects in your sample
2. Multiply units processed × opportunities per unit
3. Calculate DPMO: (Defects ÷ Total Opportunities) × 1,000,000
4. Convert DPMO to sigma using a conversion table

**Example**: Processing 500 insurance claims with 4 requirements each (completeness, accuracy, timeliness, proper documentation) = 2,000 opportunities. Finding 40 defects gives DPMO of 20,000, approximately 3.4 sigma.

### Using Tallyfy to track sigma performance

Transform sigma measurement from complex calculations to automated insights:

**Set up measurement**:
- Define defect opportunities as required fields in task forms
- Use validation rules to catch defects at the source
- Track rework tasks as defect indicators

**Monitor performance**:
- Analytics automatically calculate cycle times and completion rates
- Process health indicators show performance trends
- Export data for detailed sigma calculations

**Drive improvement**:
- Comments capture why defects occur
- Pattern analysis reveals common failure points
- A/B test process changes to improve sigma levels

### Setting meaningful targets

Avoid arbitrary goals like "reduce errors by 50%." Instead, use sigma levels to set context-appropriate targets:

**Life-critical processes** (healthcare, aviation): Target 5-6 sigma
- Even small error rates have severe consequences
- Investment in near-perfection pays off in lives saved

**Financial processes** (billing, payroll): Target 4-5 sigma  
- Errors directly impact customer trust and regulatory compliance
- Cost of prevention less than cost of correction

**Internal processes** (expense reports, meeting scheduling): Target 3-4 sigma
- Balance improvement costs with business impact
- Focus on customer-facing processes first

### Common pitfalls in sigma measurement

**Measuring activities, not outcomes**: Tracking "emails sent" rather than "customer issues resolved" misses the point. Focus on what customers value.

**Ignoring hidden factories**: Rework often hides in unmeasured activities. That "quick fix" culture masks true sigma performance. Make rework visible.

**Cherry-picking data**: Measuring only your best performers or easiest cases inflates sigma levels. Include all typical work for accurate baselines.

**Overlooking customer requirements**: Internal quality standards may not match customer expectations. A perfectly formatted report delivered late still fails the customer.

### Beyond the numbers

Sigma levels provide powerful insights, but remember:

- **Context matters**: 4 sigma might be excellent for one process, inadequate for another
- **Improvement costs escalate**: Moving from 3 to 4 sigma typically costs far less than 5 to 6
- **Cultural change required**: Higher sigma levels demand systematic thinking, not heroic efforts

The goal isn't perfection everywhere - it's appropriate quality for each process. Use sigma levels to make informed decisions about where to invest improvement efforts for maximum customer impact.
