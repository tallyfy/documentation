title: Generate, test, and prioritize improvement ideas
---

## How do you move from ideas to real improvements?

After you've analyzed your process and found root causes (covered in [Simple root cause analysis techniques](/products/pro/tutorials/how-to/process-improvement/simple-root-cause-analysis-techniques/)), it's time to generate, test, and prioritize potential solutions. Creativity meets practicality here.

### How can you generate improvement ideas?

Don't settle for the first solution that comes to mind. Push for a wide range of ideas - even unconventional ones.

-   **Brainstorming**: A group freely generates ideas without initial criticism. Aim for volume. Variations include:
    -   *Negative brainstorming*: Ask, "How could we make this process even worse?" Then flip those answers into positive solutions.
    -   *Brainwriting*: Everyone writes ideas individually before sharing, so quieter voices get heard.
-   **SCAMPER**: This acronym drives structured creative thinking:
    -   **S**ubstitute: What components, people, or rules can be replaced?
    -   **C**ombine: Can you merge steps, roles, or objectives?
    -   **A**dapt: What else is like this? What ideas does it suggest?
    -   **M**odify: Can you change an attribute - size, shape, or frequency?
    -   **P**ut to other uses: Can the process or parts of it serve a different purpose?
    -   **E**liminate: What can be removed or simplified?
    -   **R**earrange/Reverse: Can you change step order or reverse the flow?

**Tallyfy for idea generation:**

-   Create a dedicated [Tallyfy template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) for brainstorming. Each step becomes a creative prompt, with team members adding ideas via [task comments](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-report-and-resolve-issues-in-tallyfy/) or [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/).
-   Don't overlook existing Tallyfy comments on operational processes - they're often a goldmine of improvement suggestions from the people doing the work.

### How can you test ideas through piloting?

Test improvements on a small scale before committing to a full rollout. That's piloting.

-   **Why pilot?** It reduces risk, gathers real-world feedback, validates assumptions, and refines the solution before wider rollout.
-   **Running a simple pilot in Tallyfy**:
    1.  Copy the existing Tallyfy template.
    2.  Modify the copy with your proposed improvement.
    3.  Assign the pilot template to a small, representative group of users or a limited number of cases/time period.
    4.  Define what you'll measure to judge success (e.g., time reduction, error rate, user feedback).

[Tallyfy Analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/) on the pilot template gives you quantitative performance data, while [task comments](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-report-and-resolve-issues-in-tallyfy/) capture qualitative feedback from pilot users.

### How do you prioritize improvement ideas?

You'll often generate more good ideas than you can tackle at once. Prioritization keeps your effort focused on the highest-value changes.

-   **Impact/effort matrix**: This 2x2 grid categorizes ideas by potential impact (high/low) and effort to implement (high/low).
    -   **High impact, low effort (quick wins)**: Tackle these first.
    -   **High impact, high effort (major projects)**: Plan and resource these carefully.
    -   **Low impact, low effort (fill-ins)**: Bundle them or fit them in when time allows.
    -   **Low impact, high effort (time sinks)**: Skip these unless there's a strong strategic reason.

-   **Criteria selection matrix**: For more formal prioritization, score each solution against criteria like cost, time to implement, customer satisfaction gain, and strategic alignment. Weight each criterion by importance.

**Tallyfy for prioritization:**
Ideas captured in Tallyfy [comments](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-report-and-resolve-issues-in-tallyfy/) can be discussed collaboratively. [Tallyfy Analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/) can inform impact estimates (e.g., "this step takes 50% of the process time - improving it would be high impact"). Effort can be judged by how easy the [Tallyfy template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) is to modify.
