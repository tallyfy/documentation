## Choose the right improvements: From idea to impact

Once you've analyzed your process and identified root causes for problems (as discussed in [Simple root cause analysis techniques](/products/pro/tutorials/how-to/process-improvement/simple-root-cause-analysis-techniques/)), the next exciting step is to generate, test, and prioritize potential solutions. This is where creativity meets practicality to forge effective process improvements.

### Generating improvement ideas (Ideation)

Don't limit yourself to the first solution that comes to mind. Encourage a diverse range of ideas, even those that seem unconventional at first.

-   **Brainstorming**: This classic technique involves a group freely generating ideas without initial criticism. Encourage a high volume of suggestions. Variations include:
    -   *Negative Brainstorming*: Ask, "How could we make this process even worse?" Then flip the answers to find positive solutions.
    -   *Brainwriting*: Participants write down ideas individually before sharing with the group, ensuring quieter voices are heard.
-   **SCAMPER**: This acronym prompts structured creative thinking:
    -   **S**ubstitute: What components, people, or rules can be replaced?
    -   **C**ombine: Can you merge steps, roles, or objectives?
    -   **A**dapt: What else is like this? What other ideas does it suggest?
    -   **M**odify: Can you change an attribute, like size, shape, or frequency?
    -   **P**ut to other uses: Can the process or parts of it be used differently?
    -   **E**liminate: What can be removed or simplified?
    -   **R**earrange/Reverse: Can you change the order of steps or do things in reverse?

**Tallyfy for Idea Generation:**

-   Use a dedicated [Tallyfy template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) for brainstorming. Each step can serve as a creative prompt, with team members adding ideas in [task comments](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-report-and-resolve-issues-in-tallyfy/) or dedicated [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/).
-   Mine existing Tallyfy comments on operational processes â€“ they are often a goldmine of improvement suggestions directly from users.

### Testing your ideas (Piloting)

Before committing to a full-scale rollout of an improvement, it's wise to test it on a smaller scale. This is called piloting.

-   **Why Pilot?** Piloting helps to reduce risk, gather real-world feedback, validate assumptions, and refine the solution before wider implementation.
-   **Running a Simple Office Pilot**: For a process managed in Tallyfy, piloting can be as simple as:
    1.  Copying the existing Tallyfy template.
    2.  Modifying the copied template with the proposed improvement.
    3.  Assigning this pilot template to a small, representative group of users or for a limited number of cases/time period.
    4.  Clearly defining what you will measure to assess the pilot's success (e.g., time reduction, error rate, user feedback).

**Tallyfy for Piloting:**
[Tallyfy Analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/) on the piloted template can provide quantitative data on its performance, while [task comments](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-report-and-resolve-issues-in-tallyfy/) will capture qualitative feedback from the pilot users.

### Prioritizing improvement ideas

Often, you'll generate more good ideas than you can implement at once. Prioritization helps you focus on the changes that will deliver the most value.

-   **Impact/Effort Matrix**: This simple 2x2 matrix helps categorize ideas based on their potential impact (high/low) and the effort required to implement them (high/low).
    -   **High Impact, Low Effort (Quick Wins)**: These are often the best candidates to tackle first.
    -   **High Impact, High Effort (Major Projects)**: These require careful planning and resources.
    -   **Low Impact, Low Effort (Fill-ins/Incremental)**: Implement if time allows, or bundle them.
    -   **Low Impact, High Effort (Reconsider/Time Sinks)**: Generally avoid these unless there's a compelling strategic reason.

-   **Criteria Selection Matrix**: For more formal prioritization, list your potential solutions and score them against pre-defined criteria (e.g., cost to implement, time to implement, customer satisfaction improvement, alignment with strategic goals). Each criterion can be weighted based on its importance.

**Tallyfy for Prioritization:**
Ideas captured in Tallyfy [comments](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-report-and-resolve-issues-in-tallyfy/) can be discussed collaboratively. The anticipated impact might be informed by [Tallyfy Analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/) (e.g., "this step takes 50% of the process time, so improving it would be high impact"). The effort can be judged by how easy it is to modify the [Tallyfy template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).

By systematically generating, testing, and prioritizing your improvement ideas, you can ensure that your efforts are focused, effective, and lead to meaningful enhancements in your Tallyfy-managed processes.
