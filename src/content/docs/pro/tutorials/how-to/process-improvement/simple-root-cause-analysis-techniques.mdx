title: Simple root cause analysis techniques
---

## How can I find the real reasons behind process problems?

Fixing symptoms gives temporary relief. Fixing **root causes** stops problems from coming back. Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is a set of techniques that help you trace a problem back to its real source. Here are two practical methods that work well for office and service environments.

### How does the 5 Whys technique work?

The **5 Whys** is simple: state the problem, then keep asking "Why?" - usually about five times - until you reach a fundamental cause.

**How to use the 5 Whys:**

1.  **Define the problem clearly**: Start with a specific statement. Example: "The monthly sales report was submitted two days late."
2.  **Ask "Why?"**: Why did the problem occur?
    *   *Problem*: The monthly sales report was submitted two days late.
    *   *Why?* The data from the CRM system wasn't available on time.
3.  **Ask "Why?" again**: Take the answer and ask why that happened.
    *   *Why wasn't the CRM data available?* The CRM had unscheduled downtime on the data extraction day.
4.  **Keep asking "Why?"**: Repeat for each answer.
    *   *Why did the CRM have unscheduled downtime?* An emergency patch was applied without proper testing.
    *   *Why was the patch applied without testing?* The IT team felt pressured to fix an urgent bug quickly.
    *   *Why did the IT team feel pressured?* There's no clear protocol for balancing urgent fixes with testing requirements.
5.  **Identify the root cause(s)**: By the fifth "Why" (sometimes earlier or later), you'll uncover a deeper systemic issue. Here, the missing IT protocol is the real root cause - not just "CRM downtime."

**Tallyfy tip for 5 Whys:**
When a problem is flagged in a [Tallyfy task comment](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-report-and-resolve-issues-in-tallyfy/), use the comment thread to run a collaborative 5 Whys session. Each "Why" and its answer becomes a reply in the thread, keeping the analysis in context.

### How does the Fishbone Diagram help identify problem causes?

The Fishbone Diagram (named for its fish skeleton shape) is a visual tool that helps teams brainstorm and categorize potential causes of a problem.

**How to create a Fishbone Diagram for office processes:**

1.  **Define the problem (the "head")**: Write the problem statement at the "head" of the fish, on the right side.
2.  **Draw the "spine"**: Draw a horizontal line extending left from the problem.
3.  **Identify cause categories (the "bones")**: Brainstorm broad categories. For office processes, common ones include:
    *   **People**: Skills, training, communication, motivation.
    *   **Process**: Workflow issues, unclear steps, handoffs, policies.
    *   **Technology**: Software, hardware, systems, data.
    *   **Environment/Policy**: External factors, company policies, workspace issues.
    Draw diagonal lines branching off the spine, labeling each with a category.
4.  **Brainstorm specific causes**: For each category, list specific causes as smaller "bones" branching off the main ones.
    *   *Example problem*: Low customer satisfaction with support ticket resolution.
    *   *People*: Insufficient training, high agent turnover.
    *   *Process*: Too many handoffs, unclear escalation procedures.
    *   *Technology*: Slow CRM system, knowledge base hard to search.
5.  **Analyze and investigate**: Discuss the most likely causes and plan next steps - perhaps running 5 Whys on the top suspects or gathering data via Tallyfy Analytics.

```

**What to notice:**
- The problem statement (fish head) sits at the right as the focal point
- Main categories branch off like bones, organizing causes into logical groups
- Specific causes connect to their categories, showing how individual issues feed into the bigger problem

**Tallyfy tip for Fishbone Diagrams:**
Tallyfy doesn't have a built-in Fishbone tool, but you can create one on a whiteboard (physical or virtual) and attach a photo or summary to a relevant Tallyfy task or template description. The insights can then drive improvements in your process.

Both the 5 Whys and Fishbone Diagrams work best as team exercises. Different perspectives help uncover causes that one person alone would miss.

### Advanced techniques for harder problems

The 5 Whys and Fishbone work well for straightforward issues. Harder problems may need these additional approaches:

#### Pareto analysis: focus on the vital few

The Pareto Principle (80/20 rule) suggests that 80% of problems come from 20% of causes. This helps you prioritize where to spend your effort.

**How to conduct Pareto analysis**:
1. **Collect data**: Track problem frequency over time (defect types, customer complaints, error categories)
2. **Sort by frequency**: Arrange causes from most to least frequent
3. **Calculate cumulative percentage**: Add percentages as you go down the list
4. **Identify the vital few**: Find where cumulative percentage reaches 80%

**Example**: A call center analyzed customer complaints:
- Wrong information provided: 45% of complaints
- Long hold times: 25% 
- System errors: 15%
- Attitude issues: 10%
- Other: 5%

The first two categories (70% combined) likely share root causes. Focusing here yields maximum impact.

**Tallyfy application**: Use form fields to categorize issues as they occur. Analytics generates frequency data you can use for Pareto analysis.

#### Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA): prevent problems before they happen

FMEA identifies what could go wrong before it does. Originally from aerospace, it's valuable for any critical business process.

**Simple FMEA approach**:
1. **List process steps**: What could fail at each step?
2. **Rate three factors** (1-10 scale):
   - **Severity**: How bad if it fails?
   - **Occurrence**: How often might it fail?
   - **Detection**: How likely to catch before impact?
3. **Calculate Risk Priority Number (RPN)**: Severity × Occurrence × Detection
4. **Address highest RPNs first**

**Example**: New employee onboarding
- Step: "Send IT equipment"
  - Failure: Equipment arrives late
  - Severity: 8 (employee can't work)
  - Occurrence: 3 (happens occasionally)
  - Detection: 2 (hard to know until too late)
  - RPN: 48
- Action: Add tracking notifications and buffer time

**Tallyfy tip**: Build prevention into templates based on FMEA findings. Add checkpoints where high-risk failures might occur.

#### Statistical thinking for service processes

Numbers reveal patterns you can't spot by casual observation. A few useful techniques:

**Run Charts**: Plot process performance over time. Look for:
- Trends (6+ points moving same direction)
- Shifts (8+ points on one side of average)
- Patterns (repeating cycles)

A loan processor noticed approval times spiked every Monday. Root cause? Weekend applications piled up and overwhelmed Monday morning staff. Solution: stagger Monday start times.

**Scatter Diagrams**: Plot one factor against another to spot correlations.

Example: Plotting "training hours" against "error rates" for new employees showed a strong negative correlation - 20+ hours of training dramatically cut errors, justifying the investment in thorough onboarding.

### Choosing the right tool

Match technique to problem complexity:

**Use 5 Whys when**:
- Problem is relatively simple
- Need quick analysis
- Single root cause likely

**Use Fishbone when**:
- Multiple causes possible
- Need team brainstorming
- Categories help organize thinking

**Use Pareto when**:
- Many problem types exist
- Resources are limited
- Need to prioritize efforts

**Use FMEA when**:
- Implementing new processes
- Consequences of failure are severe
- Prevention beats correction

**Use statistical tools when**:
- Data is available
- Patterns aren't obvious
- Need to prove relationships

### Making root cause analysis stick

Analysis without action is wasted effort. Make sure findings drive real change:

1. **Document findings**: Attach RCA results to relevant Tallyfy processes
2. **Link to solutions**: Every root cause should connect to a specific process change
3. **Verify effectiveness**: Did addressing the root cause actually solve the problem?
4. **Share learnings**: Similar processes often have similar vulnerabilities
