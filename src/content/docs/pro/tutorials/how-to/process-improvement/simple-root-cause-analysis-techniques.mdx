## Digging deeper: Finding the real reasons for process issues

When a process isn't performing as expected, it's easy to fix the immediate symptom. However, for lasting improvement, you need to dig deeper and uncover the **root cause(s)** â€“ the fundamental reason(s) why the problem is occurring. Addressing symptoms provides temporary relief, but tackling root causes prevents the problem from recurring.

Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is a collection of techniques to help you do just that. Here are two simple yet powerful methods well-suited for office and service environments.

### The 5 Whys: Asking your way to understanding

The **5 Whys** technique is a straightforward and surprisingly effective way to explore the cause-and-effect relationships underlying a particular problem. The basic idea is to state the problem and then repeatedly ask "Why?" (typically about five times) until you arrive at a fundamental cause.

**How to use the 5 Whys:**

1.  **Define the Problem Clearly**: Start with a specific problem statement. For example, "The monthly sales report was submitted two days late."
2.  **Ask "Why?"**: Ask why the problem occurred.
    *   *Problem*: The monthly sales report was submitted two days late.
    *   *Why?* Because the data from the CRM system was not available on time.
3.  **Ask "Why?" Again**: Take the answer from step 2 and ask why that happened.
    *   *Why was the CRM data not available on time?* Because the CRM system had unscheduled downtime on the data extraction day.
4.  **Continue Asking "Why?"**: Repeat the process for each answer.
    *   *Why did the CRM have unscheduled downtime?* Because an emergency patch was applied without proper testing.
    *   *Why was the patch applied without proper testing?* Because the IT team felt pressured to fix an urgent bug quickly.
    *   *Why did the IT team feel pressured?* Because there isn't a clear protocol for balancing urgent fixes with testing requirements for critical systems.
5.  **Identify the Root Cause(s)**: By the fifth "Why" (or sometimes earlier or later), you often uncover a deeper systemic issue. In this example, the lack of a clear IT protocol is a significant root cause, rather than just blaming CRM downtime.

**Tallyfy Tip for 5 Whys:**
If a problem is flagged in a [Tallyfy task comment](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-report-and-resolve-issues-in-tallyfy/), you can use the comment thread itself to conduct a collaborative 5 Whys session with your team. Each "Why" and its answer can be a reply in the thread, keeping the analysis in context.

### Fishbone Diagram (Ishikawa or Cause-and-Effect Diagram)

The Fishbone Diagram is a visual tool that helps teams brainstorm and categorize the potential causes of a problem. It's called a Fishbone because its structure resembles a fish skeleton.

**How to create a simple Fishbone Diagram for office processes:**

1.  **Define the Problem (The "Head")**: Write the problem statement at the "head" of the fish, on the right-hand side of your drawing space.
2.  **Draw the "Spine"**: Draw a horizontal line extending to the left from the problem statement.
3.  **Identify Major Cause Categories (The "Bones")**: Brainstorm broad categories of potential causes. For office processes, common categories might include:
    *   **People**: Issues related to skills, training, communication, motivation.
    *   **Process**: Problems with the workflow itself, unclear steps, handoffs, policies.
    *   **Technology**: Issues with software, hardware, systems, data.
    *   **Environment/Policy**: External factors, company policies, workspace issues.
    Draw diagonal lines (the main "bones") branching off the spine, labeling each with a category.
4.  **Brainstorm Potential Causes**: For each major category, brainstorm specific potential causes related to the problem and list them as smaller "bones" branching off the main category bones.
    *   *Example Problem*: Low customer satisfaction with support ticket resolution.
    *   *People*: Insufficient training, high agent turnover.
    *   *Process*: Too many handoffs, unclear escalation procedures.
    *   *Technology*: Slow CRM system, knowledge base hard to search.
5.  **Analyze and Investigate**: Once the diagram is populated, the team can discuss the potential causes, identify the most likely ones, and plan further investigation (perhaps using 5 Whys on the most probable causes or gathering data via Tallyfy Analytics).

**Tallyfy Tip for Fishbone Diagrams:**
While Tallyfy doesn't have a built-in Fishbone tool, you can create one collaboratively on a whiteboard (physical or virtual) and then attach a photo or summary of the diagram to a relevant Tallyfy task or process template description. The insights gained can then inform improvements to your Tallyfy process.

:::note[Collaborative Effort]
Both the 5 Whys and Fishbone Diagrams are most effective when used as team exercises. Diverse perspectives help uncover a wider range of potential causes and lead to more robust solutions.
