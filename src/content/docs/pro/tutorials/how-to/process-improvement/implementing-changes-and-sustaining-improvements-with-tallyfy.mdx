title: Implement and sustain improvements with Tallyfy

## Ensure process improvements deliver lasting benefits

Identifying a great improvement idea is only half the battle; successfully implementing it and ensuring it delivers lasting benefits is equally critical. This is where the "Improve" and "Control" aspects of methodologies like DMAIC come into play, focusing on rolling out changes effectively and making them stick.

### Implementing your process changes

Once you've identified improvement opportunities and designed better workflows, the next critical phase is putting those changes into practice and ensuring they stick. This involves more than just announcing a new process; it requires careful execution, communication, training, and ongoing monitoring.

**Implementing with Tallyfy:**

*   **Update Templates Instantly**: Modify your [procedure templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) or [document templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) in Tallyfy. All new [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) launched from that template will automatically use the updated version. There's no need to redistribute paper documents or worry about outdated versions.

### Sustaining improvements with Tallyfy

Making improvements is one thing; making them last is another. Tallyfy helps embed new ways of working:

*   **Standardization**: Because processes are executed within Tallyfy, adherence to the new standard is inherently encouraged. Deviations are harder to make unintentionally.
*   **Visibility & Monitoring**: Use **[Tallyfy Analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/)** and the **[Tracker view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** to monitor if the new process is being followed and if it's delivering the expected benefits (e.g., faster completion times, fewer errors).
*   **Feedback Loops**: Continue to use **[Tallyfy's comment features](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-can-i-manage-comments-in-tallyfy/)** for ongoing feedback on the improved process. This allows for further minor adjustments and reinforces a culture of continuous improvement.
*   **Regular Reviews**: Schedule periodic reviews of your key processes. The data from Tallyfy can inform these reviews, helping you identify if the process is still optimal or if new bottlenecks have emerged.

By leveraging Tallyfy's features, implementing and sustaining process improvements becomes a more integrated and less burdensome activity. The platform itself helps enforce the new standard, monitors its performance, and facilitates ongoing refinement.
