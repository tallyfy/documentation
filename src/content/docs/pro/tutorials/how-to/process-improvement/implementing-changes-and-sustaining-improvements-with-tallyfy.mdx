## How can I make process improvements stick?

Embed your changes directly into Tallyfy workflows - don't rely on training alone. A great improvement idea is only half the work. Rolling it out and keeping it going is where the DMAIC "Improve" and "Control" phases matter most.

### Implementing changes effectively

Traditional training fails because of the [Ebbinghaus forgetting curve](/products/pro/tutorials/why-documentation-training-fails-forgetting-curve/) - people forget 90% of what they learn within a week. Instead of relying on memory, build the new process right into the workflow.

**How to do it in Tallyfy:** Modify your [procedure templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) or [document templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/). Every new [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) launched from that template automatically uses the updated version. No paper redistribution. No outdated copies floating around.

### Sustaining improvements over time

Making improvements is one thing - making them last is another. Here's how Tallyfy helps:

*   **Standardization** - When people run processes inside Tallyfy, they follow the new standard by default. Accidental deviations become much harder.
*   **Visibility and monitoring** - Use [Tallyfy Analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/) and the [Tracker view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/) to check whether the new process is being followed and delivering results (faster completion times, fewer errors, etc.).
*   **Feedback loops** - Use [Tallyfy's comment features](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-can-i-manage-comments-in-tallyfy/) to gather ongoing feedback. This lets your team flag issues and suggest tweaks, reinforcing a culture of continuous improvement.
*   **Regular reviews** - Schedule periodic reviews of key processes. Tallyfy's data helps you spot whether things are still running well or if new bottlenecks have crept in.
