## Signing up and creating an organization

Creating a user account and creating an organization are separate steps in Tallyfy:

1. Visit [https://tallyfy.com/start/](https://tallyfy.com/start/)
2. Fill out the required fields and click submit
3. Using Microsoft or Google accounts is recommended for simplified authentication
4. Complete the registration process to create your account

When you first create a new organization in Tallyfy, you'll see a welcome task automatically assigned to you that explains how Tallyfy works. You can interact with this onboarding task by replying or commenting on it to reach someone who can help you with your questions. If you prefer to schedule a live conversation with our team, you can book a call via [https://tallyfy.com/booking/](https://tallyfy.com/booking/). This introductory task helps you understand the platform's basic functionality and is only available to users who create new organizations.

Tallyfy uses a centralized identity and access management system at [account.tallyfy.com](https://account.tallyfy.com) for all products. This system handles sign up, sign in, SSO, and account management functions like password recovery across all Tallyfy products.

If your account is a member of multiple organizations, you can easily switch between them. Click your name/profile picture in the top-right corner and select "Switch organization" to access other roles and organizations associated with your account.
