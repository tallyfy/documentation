## Signing up for Tallyfy and creating your organization

To start using Tallyfy, you first create a user account. This account lets you create your company's workspace (an organization) or join one that already exists.

<Steps>
1. Go to the Tallyfy sign-up page: [https://tallyfy.com/start/](https://tallyfy.com/start/)
2. Fill in your details (name, email, password).
3. Using your existing Microsoft or Google account to sign up is often easier.
4. Follow the prompts to finish creating your user account and set up your first organization.
</Steps>

When you create a brand new organization, Tallyfy usually assigns you a helpful welcome [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to guide you through the basics. You can ask questions by commenting on this task, or book a free call with support via [https://tallyfy.com/booking/](https://tallyfy.com/booking/).

Your Tallyfy login (email and password) is managed through a central system ([account.tallyfy.com](https://account.tallyfy.com)), which handles sign-ins and password resets for all Tallyfy products.

If your email address is later invited to join other Tallyfy organizations (e.g., a client's or partner's), you can easily [switch between them](/products/pro/settings/personal-settings/how-can-i-switch-between-organizations-in-tallyfy/) using the same login.
