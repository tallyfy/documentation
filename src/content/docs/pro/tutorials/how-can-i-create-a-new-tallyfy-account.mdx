## Signing up for Tallyfy and creating your organization

To start using Tallyfy workflow management, you first create a user account. This account lets you create your company's workspace (an organization) or join one that already exists.

<Steps>
1. Go to the Tallyfy sign-up page: [https://tallyfy.com/start/](https://tallyfy.com/start/)
2. Fill in your details (name, email, password).
3. Using your existing Microsoft or Google account to sign up is often easier.
4. Follow the prompts to finish creating your user account and set up your first organization.
</Steps>

When you create a brand new organization, Tallyfy usually assigns you a helpful welcome [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to guide you through the basics. You can ask questions by commenting on this task, or book a free call with support via [https://tallyfy.com/booking/](https://tallyfy.com/booking/).

### Microsoft sign-in requiring admin approval

If you're trying to sign up or sign in with Microsoft and see "Need admin approval" - this happens when your organization has restricted which apps employees can access. The error means Tallyfy needs permission from your IT administrator before you can use it.

**For users seeing this error:**
1. Take a screenshot of the "Need admin approval" message
2. Send it to your IT administrator or help desk
3. Ask them to approve the "Tallyfy API" application in Azure Active Directory
4. As an alternative, create your account using email and password instead of Microsoft sign-in

**For IT administrators:**
To approve Tallyfy for your organization:
1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) as an administrator
2. Navigate to **Azure Active Directory** â†’ **Enterprise applications**
3. Search for "Tallyfy API" in pending requests or consent requests
4. Review and approve the application for your organization
5. Grant the requested permissions (basic profile and email access)

After approval, users in your organization can sign in with their Microsoft accounts. The approval only needs to happen once for your entire organization.

For more details about this Azure AD consent requirement, see [Microsoft's documentation on admin approval](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1497998/need-admin-approval-popup).

Your Tallyfy login (email and password) is managed through a central system ([account.tallyfy.com](https://account.tallyfy.com)), which handles sign-ins and password resets for all Tallyfy products.

If your email address is later invited to join other Tallyfy organizations (e.g., a client's or partner's), you can easily [switch between them](/products/pro/settings/personal-settings/how-can-i-switch-between-organizations-in-tallyfy/) using the same login.
