## Sign up for Tallyfy and create your organization

To start using Tallyfy, you'll create a user account first. This account lets you set up your company's workspace (an organization) or join one that already exists. Learn more [about Tallyfy](/products/pro/miscellaneous/about-tallyfy/).

<Steps>
1. Go to the Tallyfy sign-up page: [https://tallyfy.com/start/](https://tallyfy.com/start/)
2. Fill in your details (name, email, password).
3. You can also sign up with your existing Microsoft or Google account - it's often easier.
4. Follow the prompts to finish creating your account and set up your first organization.
</Steps>

When you create a new organization, Tallyfy assigns you a welcome [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) that walks you through the basics. You can ask questions by commenting on this task, or book a free call with support at [https://tallyfy.com/booking/](https://tallyfy.com/booking/).

### Microsoft sign-in requiring admin approval

If you see "Need admin approval" when signing in with Microsoft - your organization has restricted which apps employees can access. Tallyfy needs permission from your IT administrator before you can use it.

**For users seeing this error:**
1. Take a screenshot of the "Need admin approval" message
2. Send it to your IT administrator or help desk
3. Ask them to approve the "Tallyfy API" application in Azure Active Directory
4. Alternatively, create your account using email and password instead of Microsoft sign-in

**For IT administrators:**
To approve Tallyfy for your organization:
1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) as an administrator
2. Navigate to **Azure Active Directory** → **Enterprise applications**
3. Search for "Tallyfy API" in pending requests or consent requests
4. Review and approve the application for your organization
5. Grant the requested permissions (basic profile and email access)

After approval, users in your organization can sign in with their Microsoft accounts. This only needs to happen once for your entire organization.

For more details, see [Microsoft's documentation on admin approval](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1497998/need-admin-approval-popup).

Your Tallyfy login is managed through a central system ([account.tallyfy.com](https://account.tallyfy.com)), which handles sign-ins and password resets for all Tallyfy products.

If you're later invited to join other Tallyfy organizations (e.g., a client's or partner's), you can [switch between them](/products/pro/settings/personal-settings/how-can-i-switch-between-organizations-in-tallyfy/) using the same login.

:::tip[Stuck in authentication loops?]
If you're redirected repeatedly or can't complete account creation, visit [https://account.tallyfy.com/logout](https://account.tallyfy.com/logout) to clear all sessions, then try again. This fixes most authentication issues.
