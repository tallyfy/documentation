## Tutorial: Create an Automation (Example)

This tutorial shows a simple example of how to create an [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) rule in Tallyfy.

### Basic Concepts

Automation rules follow an "IF... THEN..." logic:

*   **IF** something specific happens (the *Condition*), like a task is completed, or a form field has a certain value...
*   **THEN** Tallyfy automatically does something (the *Action*), like showing a hidden step, assigning a task, or changing a deadline.

You can build rules based on task completion, form field answers, approval decisions (Approve/Reject steps), and more.

**Example Scenario:** In an Employee Onboarding process, you want to show different steps depending on whether the new hire is a "Field Worker" or an "Office Worker".

### Form Field Example Setup

Here's how to set up the automation for the example scenario:

<Steps>
1.  **Create the Template**: Start building your "Employee Onboarding" [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). Have Step 1 collect basic info. Have Step 2 be "Field Training" and Step 3 be "Office Orientation".
2.  **Add the Form Field**: In Step 1, add a [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to ask for the employee's role. Use the **Radio Button** type with two options: "Field worker" and "Office worker".

3.  **Hide Steps Initially**: In the template editor, set both Step 2 ("Field Training") and Step 3 ("Office Orientation") to be hidden by default when the process starts.
4.  **Create Automation Rule 1 (for Field Worker)**:
    *   Go to the **Automations** section of the template editor.
    *   Create a new rule.
    *   Set the **IF** condition: Check if the "Role" form field from Step 1 **Is** "Field worker".
    *   Set the **THEN** action: Use a **Visibility** action to **SHOW** Step 2 ("Field Training").
    *   Give the rule a clear name, like "Show Field Training if Role is Field Worker".

5.  **Create Automation Rule 2 (for Office Worker)**:
    *   Create another new rule.
    *   Set the **IF** condition: Check if the "Role" form field from Step 1 **Is** "Office worker".
    *   Set the **THEN** action: Use a **Visibility** action to **SHOW** Step 3 ("Office Orientation").
    *   Give it a clear name, like "Show Office Orientation if Role is Office Worker".
6.  **Launch**: Now, when you [launch](/products/pro/launching/) this process:
    *   Only Step 1 will be visible initially.
    *   When the user selects the role in Step 1 and completes it, only the correct follow-up step (either Step 2 or Step 3) will appear based on the automation rules.
</Steps>

:::note[Name Your Automations Clearly!]
Always give your automation rules descriptive names (like in the examples above). Avoid generic names like "Rule 1". This makes it much easier for you and others to understand what the rules do later.
:::

:::note[Important: Choose descriptive automation names]
When creating [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/), use clear, descriptive names that explain what the automation does. For example, name an automation "Only for part-time employees" rather than "Automation 1" or "Field check". This makes it easier for anyone else who needs to understand or modify the automation later to immediately grasp its purpose without having to examine all the conditions and actions.
:::

Once the process is launched:

* Only Step 1 will be assigned and visible at first.
* After the employee selects their role in Step 1, the relevant step (2 or 3) will be assigned and shown. The assigned person(s) will be notified accordingly.
* The assignee(s) can click on the [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) link in their email to complete the assigned step.
