## Automating processes with rules

Tallyfy [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) rules let you build "if-this-then-that" logic so your workflows adapt automatically - no manual adjustments needed.

### How automation rules work

Every rule has two parts:

*   **IF** a specific event happens (the *Condition*) - like a task completion, a form field value, or an approval decision...
*   **THEN** Tallyfy runs a defined action (the *Action*) - like revealing hidden steps, reassigning tasks, or changing deadlines

**Example scenario:** In an Employee Onboarding process, you want to show different steps based on whether the new hire is a "Field worker" or an "Office worker".

### Setting up form field automation for onboarding

<Steps>
1.  **Create the template**: Build your "Employee Onboarding" [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). Step 1 collects basic info. Step 2 is "Field Training" and Step 3 is "Office Orientation".
2.  **Add the form field**: In Step 1, add a [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) for the employee's role. Use the **Radio Button** type with two options: "Field worker" and "Office worker".

3.  **Hide steps initially**: In the template editor, set both Step 2 ("Field Training") and Step 3 ("Office Orientation") to hidden by default.
4.  **Create automation rule 1 (for Field Worker)**:
    *   Go to the **Automations** section in the template editor.
    *   Create a new rule.
    *   **IF** condition: The "Role" form field (from Step 1) **Is** "Field worker".
    *   **THEN** action: **Visibility** > **SHOW** Step 2 ("Field Training").
    *   Name it descriptively, e.g., "Show Field Training if Role is Field Worker".

5.  **Create automation rule 2 (for Office Worker)**:
    *   Create another new rule.
    *   **IF** condition: The "Role" form field (from Step 1) **Is** "Office worker".
    *   **THEN** action: **Visibility** > **SHOW** Step 3 ("Office Orientation").
    *   Name it descriptively, e.g., "Show Office Orientation if Role is Office Worker".
6.  **Launch the process**: When you [launch](/products/pro/launching/) this process, only Step 1 is visible at first. After the user picks a role and completes Step 1, the matching rule fires and reveals the right follow-up step.
</Steps>

:::note[Use clear automation names]
Give your [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) rules descriptive names (e.g., "Show Field Training if Role is Field Worker"). Avoid generic names like "Rule 1". Clear names let you and your team understand each rule's purpose at a glance.
:::

What happens at runtime:

* Only Step 1 appears at first.
* Once the employee picks their role in Step 1, the relevant step (2 or 3) becomes visible and assigned. Assignees get automatic notifications.
* Assignees click the [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) link in their email to complete their step.
