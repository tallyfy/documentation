## How can Tallyfy automate and streamline my processes?

This practical tutorial demonstrates creating intelligent [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) rules in Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> that dynamically adapt workflows based on specific conditions and user inputs.

Automation rules eliminate manual workflow adjustments while ensuring processes automatically respond to changing circumstances. This reduces administrative overhead and improves operational efficiency across your organization.

### What are the basic automation concepts in Tallyfy?

Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> automation rules operate through sophisticated "if-this-then-that" conditional logic that responds intelligently to workflow events:

*   **IF** specific events occur (the *Condition*), such as task completions, particular form field values, or approval decisions...
*   **THEN** Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> automatically executes defined actions (the *Action*), including revealing hidden steps, reassigning tasks, or modifying deadlines

Automation rules can be created based on various conditions including task completion, form field answers, and approval decisions from Approve/Reject steps.

**Example scenario:** In an Employee Onboarding process, you want to display different steps based on whether the new hire is a "Field worker" or an "Office worker".

### How can I set up form field automation for employee onboarding?

Follow these steps to configure the automation for the example scenario:

<Steps>
1.  **Create the template**: Start building your "Employee Onboarding" [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). Step 1 should collect basic information. Make Step 2 "Field Training" and Step 3 "Office Orientation".
2.  **Add the form field**: In Step 1, add a [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) asking for the employee's role. Use the **Radio Button** type with two options: "Field worker" and "Office worker".

3.  **Hide steps initially**: In the template editor, configure both Step 2 ("Field Training") and Step 3 ("Office Orientation") to be hidden by default when the process starts.
4.  **Create automation rule 1 (for Field Worker)**:
    *   Navigate to the **Automations** section within the template editor.
    *   Create a new rule.
    *   Set the **IF** condition: Check if the "Role" form field (from Step 1) **Is** "Field worker".
    *   Set the **THEN** action: Use a **Visibility** action to **SHOW** Step 2 ("Field Training").
    *   Name the rule clearly, e.g., "Show Field Training if Role is Field Worker".

5.  **Create automation rule 2 (for Office Worker)**:
    *   Create another new rule.
    *   Set the **IF** condition: Check if the "Role" form field (from Step 1) **Is** "Office worker".
    *   Set the **THEN** action: Use a **Visibility** action to **SHOW** Step 3 ("Office Orientation").
    *   Name it clearly, e.g., "Show Office Orientation if Role is Office Worker".
6.  **Launch the process**: When you [launch](/products/pro/launching/) this process:
    *   Only Step 1 will be visible at the start.
    *   After the user selects the role in Step 1 and completes it, the automation rules trigger, showing only the relevant follow-up step (either Step 2 or Step 3).
</Steps>

:::note[Use clear automation names]
Always give your [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) rules descriptive names (like in the examples: "Show Field Training if Role is Field Worker"). Avoid generic names like "Rule 1" or "Field Check". Clear names make it much easier for you and others to understand the purpose of each rule later without needing to examine its conditions and actions.
:::

What happens when the process launches:

* Only Step 1 appears as assigned and visible initially.
* After the employee selects their role in Step 1, the relevant step (either 2 or 3) becomes assigned and visible. The designated assignees receive automatic notifications.
* Assignees can click the [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) link in their email notification to complete their assigned step.
