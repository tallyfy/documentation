## Creating your first workflow template

This tutorial shows how to create your first process template in Tallyfy for workflow standardization.

Tallyfy templates work as reusable blueprints for your repeatable business workflows, letting you execute them consistently across your organization.

### Creating a template with Tallyfy AI

This example shows how to use Tallyfy AI to create workflow templates quickly and efficiently.

<Steps>
1.  Click the **+ Create** button (located in the top left sidebar).

3.  Choose your creation method. For this example, select **Tallyfy AI**. (Other options include **From scratch** or **From SOP document**).
4.  Prompt Tallyfy AI to create a business process workflow. Let's create a 'Client Onboarding' process for an accounting company:
    *   Select **Procedure** for the template type.
    *   Enter a descriptive name, like "Client Onboarding for Accounting Firm".
    *   *(Optional)* Specify your company type (e.g., Accounting) to assist the AI.
    *   Click **Create**.

5.  Tallyfy AI will generate suggested workflow steps for your process. Review the generated steps (you can modify them later) and click **Continue**.

</Steps>

### Alternative template creation methods

Besides using Tallyfy AI, you can also create workflow templates using these methods:

*   **From Scratch**: Build your workflow template step-by-step manually for complete customization
*   **From SOP document**: Upload an existing Word document, PDF, or flowchart file. Tallyfy AI will convert it into a structured template for quick migration

Each method serves different needs based on your starting point and customization requirements.

See [Create a Template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/create-template/) for detailed information on all methods.
