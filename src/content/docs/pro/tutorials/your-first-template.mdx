### Alternative Creation Methods

Tallyfy also supports template creation by uploading existing documents or flowcharts:

2. Upload your document or flowchart file
3. Choose your preferred output format:
   - **Document**: Creates a cleaned-up version of your upload with formatting simplified and sections reorganized
   - **Procedure**: Converts your upload into a step-by-step workflow process
4. Review and adjust the generated template as needed

### Finalizing the Template
