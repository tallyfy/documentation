## How can I create my first workflow template in Tallyfy?

### How can I create a template using Tallyfy® AI for rapid development?

3.  Choose your creation method. For this example, select **Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> AI**. (Other options include **From scratch** or **From SOP document**).
4.  Prompt Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> AI to create a business process workflow. Let's create a 'Client Onboarding' process for an accounting company:
    *   Select **Procedure** for the template type.
    *   Enter a descriptive name, like "Client Onboarding for Accounting Firm".
    *   *(Optional)* Specify your company type (e.g., Accounting) to assist the AI.
    *   Click **Create**.

### What alternative methods can I use to create workflow templates?

Besides using Tallyfy® AI, you can also create workflow templates using these methods:

*   **From Scratch**: Build your workflow template step-by-step manually for complete customization
*   **From SOP document**: Upload an existing Word document, PDF, or flowchart file. Tallyfy® AI will convert it into a structured template for quick migration

Each method serves different needs based on your starting point and customization requirements.

See [Create a Template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/create-template/) for detailed information on all methods.
