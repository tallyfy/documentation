3. Choose your preferred template creation method:
   - **From scratch**: Manually specify each step
   - **Tallyfy AI**: Automatically generate a template based on your requirements
   
   For this example, select **Tallyfy AI** to create a 'Client Onboarding' process for an accounting company. Tallyfy's [client onboarding software](https://tallyfy.com/solutions/client-onboarding-software/) helps you standardize and automate the entire onboarding process for new clients.

   - **Document**: Creates a cleaned-up version of your upload with formatting simplified and sections reorganized
   - **Procedure**: Converts your upload into a step-by-step workflow process
4. Review and adjust the generated template as needed

### Finalizing the Template
