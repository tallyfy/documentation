## What's a template?

Templates are reusable blueprints for repeatable processes. Build one, then run it consistently every time.

### Create a template with Tallyfy AI

The fastest way to build a template is with Tallyfy AI:

<Steps>
1.  Click **+ Create** in the top left sidebar.

2.  Select **Create Template**.

3.  Choose **Tallyfy AI** as the creation method. You'll also see **From scratch** and **From SOP document** options.
4.  Describe the process you want. For example, a "Client Onboarding" process for an accounting firm:
    *   Select **Procedure** as the template type.
    *   Enter a descriptive name, like "Client Onboarding for Accounting Firm".
    *   *(Optional)* Specify your company type (e.g., Accounting) to give the AI more context.
    *   Click **Create**.

### Other creation methods

*   **From scratch** - Build steps manually for full control over every detail.
*   **From SOP document** - Upload a Word doc, PDF, or flowchart. Tallyfy AI converts it into a structured template.
