## How can I create my first workflow template in Tallyfy?

This tutorial explains how to create your first process template in Tallyfy for workflow standardization.

Templates serve as reusable blueprints for your repeatable business workflows, enabling consistent execution across your organization.

### How can I create a template using Tallyfy® AI for rapid development?

This example demonstrates using Tallyfy® AI to create workflow templates quickly and efficiently.

<Steps>
1.  Click the **+ Create** button (located in the top left sidebar).

3.  Choose your creation method. For this example, select **Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> AI**. (Other options include **From scratch** or **From SOP document**).
4.  Prompt Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> AI to create a business process workflow. Let's create a 'Client Onboarding' process for an accounting company:
    *   Select **Procedure** for the template type.
    *   Enter a descriptive name, like "Client Onboarding for Accounting Firm".
    *   *(Optional)* Specify your company type (e.g., Accounting) to assist the AI.
    *   Click **Create**.

### What alternative methods can I use to create workflow templates?

Besides using Tallyfy® AI, you can also create workflow templates using these methods:

*   **From Scratch**: Build your workflow template step-by-step manually for complete customization
*   **From SOP document**: Upload an existing Word document, PDF, or flowchart file. Tallyfy® AI will convert it into a structured template for quick migration

Each method serves different needs based on your starting point and customization requirements.

See [Create a Template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/create-template/) for detailed information on all methods.
