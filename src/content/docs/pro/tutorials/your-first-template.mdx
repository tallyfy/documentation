## Creating your first template

Templates are reusable blueprints for your repeatable processes. Build one, then run it consistently every time.

### Creating a template with Tallyfy AI

The fastest way to build a template is with Tallyfy AI. Here's how:

<Steps>
1.  Click the **+ Create** button in the top left sidebar.

2.  Select **Create Template** from the menu.

3.  Select **Tallyfy AI** as the creation method. You'll also see **From scratch** and **From SOP document** options.
4.  Describe the process you want. For example, a "Client Onboarding" process for an accounting firm:
    *   Select **Procedure** for the template type.
    *   Enter a descriptive name, like "Client Onboarding for Accounting Firm".
    *   *(Optional)* Specify your company type (e.g., Accounting) to help the AI.
    *   Click **Create**.

### Other creation methods

Two more ways to create templates:

*   **From scratch** - Build steps manually for full control over every detail.
*   **From SOP document** - Upload a Word doc, PDF, or flowchart. Tallyfy AI converts it into a structured template.

See [Create a Template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/create-template/) for details on all methods.
