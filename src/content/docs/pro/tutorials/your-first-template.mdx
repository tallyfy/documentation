## Tutorial: Creating your first template

This tutorial explains how to create your first process [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). Templates serve as the blueprints for your repeatable workflows.

### Creating a template using a Tallyfy AI example

This example uses Tallyfy AI to get started quickly.

<Steps>
1.  Click the **+ Create** button (located in the top left sidebar).
    ![Create button](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-click-create-fullscreen.png)
2.  Select **Create Template** from the menu.

3.  Choose your creation method. For this example, select **Tallyfy AI**. (Other options include **From scratch** or **From SOP document**).
4.  Prompt the AI to create a process. Let's try a 'Client Onboarding' process for an accounting company:
    *   Select **Procedure** for the template type.
    *   Enter a descriptive name, like "Client Onboarding for Accounting Firm".
    *   *(Optional)* Specify your company type (e.g., Accounting) to assist the AI.
    *   Click **Create**.

</Steps>

### Other ways to create templates

Remember, besides using Tallyfy AI, you can also create templates:

*   **From Scratch**: Build the template step-by-step manually.
*   **From SOP document**: Upload an existing Word document, PDF, or flowchart. Tallyfy AI will attempt to convert it into a template structure.

See [Create a Template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/create-template/) for detailed information on all methods.
