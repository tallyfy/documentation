## Tutorial: Create a template

Let's start simple by learning how to create a template using the side bar.

1. First, click on the **"Create"** button at the top of the left side bar.

3. You'll can either create a template from scratch or by using Tallyfy AI. Opting for the **From scratch** choice requires you to manually specify each step. On the other hand, choosing **Tallyfy AI** will automatically generate a generic template for the process you need. Let's imagine we go with the **'Tallyfy AI** option and customize the details afterwards. Let's create a 'Client Onboarding' process for an accounting company. Change things to suit your needs!

Note that you also create a template by uploading a document, such as a PDF.

4. You will see a set of automatically generated steps, allowing you to delete any unnecessary steps or modify them later in the template editor. Once you're satisfied with the result, click on **Continue** to create your template.

5. That's it! You have created your first template. You'll get redirected to the template editor - where you can edit any step you like, add new ones, and even [launch your first process](/products/pro/tutorials/your-first-process/)
