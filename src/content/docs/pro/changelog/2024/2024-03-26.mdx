### Changes

- **[UI]** AI procedure creation is now twice as fast and generates better organized templates with grouped sections instead of a flat list of steps.

### Bug Fixes

- **[UI]** Fixed Tracker view access issue so you can now click on process cards without errors.
- **[UI]** Fixed table form fields not saving properly when guests complete tasks on mobile browsers.
- **[UI]** Fixed page jumping and misclicks when completing tasks with the right pane open by smoothly transitioning to the next task instead of closing the pane.
- **[UI]** Document template field names now save permanently when renamed, so your customizations stick when you navigate away and come back.
- **[UI]** Fixed the Tools button in document view to only appear when you have multiple linked tasks, preventing confusing inactive states and loading issues.
- **[UI]** Fixed table data from guest users not displaying properly in kick-off forms, ensuring all table information now shows correctly throughout the process.

### Removed

- **[UI]** Removed confusing steps view from document processes, making them open directly to the page view for clearer editing.
