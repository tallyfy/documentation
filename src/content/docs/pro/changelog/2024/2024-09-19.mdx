### New Features

- **[UI]** Added task and process IDs to the Variables dropdown, making it easier to reference specific workflows in your automations and integrations.

### Changes

- **[UI]** Clarified that magic link values need double quotation marks to properly populate form fields when launching processes.
- **[UI]** Template Editor navigation now uses organized dropdown menus to make it easier to find actions like export, duplicate, and archive settings.

### Bug Fixes

- **[UI]** Fixed checklist validation alerts so they now stay visible until you select at least one required option before completing tasks.
- **[UI]** Fixed blank name bubbles in process permissions by resolving a display conflict, so you can now clearly see who has access to each process.
- **[UI]** Fixed process naming when using assignee variables - processes now get proper names even when assignees are selected during launch.
- **[UI]** Fixed tracker presets not applying on first click when they had empty filter criteria, so presets now work reliably without needing to clear and reselect them.
- **[UI]** Dropdown menus in Tracker's mobile view now display fully instead of being cut off, making it easier to sort and filter on your phone.
