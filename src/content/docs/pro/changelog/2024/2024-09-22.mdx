- **[UI]** Redesigned template step editing with tabbed categories instead of accordion menus, making it faster to configure steps and automations.

### Bug Fixes

- **[UI]** Fixed sign-out button getting stuck on loading screen - you can now log out smoothly without needing to refresh your browser.
- **[UI]** Auto-archive settings in processes now stay exactly as you set them, instead of unexpectedly reverting back to the default 52-week option.
