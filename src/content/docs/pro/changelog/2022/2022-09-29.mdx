### Changes

- **[UI]** Avatar icons now appear next to completed tasks in the left pane, making it easier to see who finished each task at a glance.
- **[UI]** Deadline dates now show precise "X days ago" or "in X days" instead of vague month descriptions, making it easier to understand exactly when tasks are due.

### Bug Fixes

- **[UI]** Fixed template PDF export to include all pages instead of only showing the first page when printing.
- **[UI]** Fixed form fields not showing up in Tasks view, so you can now see and fill out all required fields to complete your tasks.
- **[UI]** Fixed text fields incorrectly showing "No information entered" after completing forms, even when you had filled them in properly.
- **[UI]** Fixed missing validation message when signing up and selecting "Something else" without filling the required field, ensuring smoother onboarding.
- **[UI]** URLs in document templates now automatically become clickable links and line breaks work properly when filling in text fields.
- **[UI]** Fixed an issue where duplicating steps with table rules would fail, so you can now reliably copy complex workflow steps without errors.
