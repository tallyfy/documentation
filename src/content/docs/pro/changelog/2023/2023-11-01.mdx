### Changes

- **[UI]** Made it easier to report bugs and request features with a clearer, more structured issue template.
- **[UI]** Fixed an edge case where backspace wouldn't remove embedded template elements from description fields in rare scenarios.
- **[UI]** Redesigned deadline automation settings with clearer "Plus/Minus" options and intuitive date selection, making it much easier to set up automated task deadlines.
- **[UI]** We're exploring smarter onboarding that creates personalized templates for you automatically, so you can start using workflows immediately instead of building from scratch.
- **[UI]** Redesigned the automations interface with clearer navigation and focused editing to make managing your "if this then that" rules much easier.

### Bug Fixes

- **[UI]** Based on the issue summary provided, this appears to be a template or formatting guide rather than an actual product issue that was fixed. Since no specific technical problem or user-facing improvement is described, I cannot create a meaningful changelog entry. 

To write an effective changelog entry, I would need details about an actual bug fix, feature improvement, or enhancement that impacts users - such as what specific permission issue was resolved or what template-to-process access problem was addressed.
- **[UI]** Automation titles now prevent you from typing beyond 300 characters, so you'll never hit an unexpected error when saving.
- **[UI]** Fixed template references in document templates so they now display properly in Preview mode without needing to refresh your browser.
- **[UI]** Fixed saving issues with automations that use multiple "is any of" conditions, so your complex automation rules now save reliably every time.
- **[UI]** Fixed "Create Folder" modal sizing and positioning to work properly on mobile devices and smaller screens.
- **[UI]** Fixed step visibility to instantly grey out both sides of the editor when hide/show automations are applied, eliminating the need to refresh.
