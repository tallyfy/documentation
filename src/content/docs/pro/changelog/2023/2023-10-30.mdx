### New Features

- **[API]** You can now set task deadlines that automatically adjust based on dates from your forms, like "2 days before contract expiry date."

### Changes

- **[UI]** We enhanced our quality assurance process to deliver more reliable updates and fewer disruptions to your workflow.
- **[UI]** Late-completed tasks now show in green with clearer "Late" labels instead of confusing red text that looked like errors.
- **[UI]** We're replacing automatic AI template generation at signup with a simpler "Create and Launch" feature for faster workflow creation.
- **[UI]** Administrators can now easily manage notification cadences for members and guests with improved visual feedback and streamlined editing directly in the interface.
- **[API]** Cleaned up API documentation to use "template" instead of "blueprint" everywhere, making our developer docs clearer and more consistent.

### Bug Fixes

- **[UI]** Fixed duplicate step button in checklists to work more reliably when copying existing steps.
- **[UI]** Fixed referenced templates now displaying correctly in Preview mode without needing to refresh your browser.
- **[UI]** Fixed an issue where automations with multiple "is any of" conditions would sometimes fail to save or appear blank when reopened.
- **[UI]** Fixed template step deletion by adding clear warnings when steps are used in automations, showing exactly which rules need updating first.
- **[UI]** Fixed tooltip display issues in mobile Tracker view so Favorite and Assignees icons now show helpful information properly on phones and tablets.
- **[UI]** Checklist progress now saves when you partially complete items, so you can return later to finish without losing your work.
- **[UI]** Fixed form field variables to properly display table data and rich text formatting, plus made kick-off table content visible to task assignees.
- **[UI]** Removed the 4-member minimum billing requirement, so you now only pay for the exact number of team members you actually use.
- **[UI]** Fixed tooltip display issues in Tracker view so you can now properly see "Mark as favorite" and assignee information without cutoff.
- **[API]** Member activity tracking now shows complete history including invitation status and account changes for better admin oversight.
