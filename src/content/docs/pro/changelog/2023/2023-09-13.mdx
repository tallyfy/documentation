### New Features

- **[UI]** Added an "Anyone" filter to the Tasks view so you can now see all tasks across your organization, not just your own assigned tasks.

### Changes

- **[UI]** QA testing completed across all features before deployment, ensuring a smoother and more reliable experience for users.
- **[UI]** Enhanced the "Generate Process Name" feature with visual feedback including button hover effects and loading indicators for a smoother experience.
- **[UI]** Rejecting tasks now requires entering a reason, giving everyone better context and improving communication across all processes.
- **[UI]** Process naming now shows clearer labels during launch and adds optional AI suggestions via a magic wand button instead of automatic generation.
- **[UI]** Navigation buttons now only show options you can actually use, making template editing cleaner and less confusing.

### Bug Fixes

- **[UI]** Fixed "On Time" task filter to display in green instead of brand color for clearer visual distinction between task states.
- **[UI]** Fixed auto-save alerts in the template editor to match your organization's branding colors for a more consistent experience.
- **[UI]** Fixed a rare issue where short text fields would sometimes disappear right after being created in document templates.
- **[UI]** Fixed missing save and discard buttons when editing tasks in the tracker view while using masquerade mode.
- **[UI]** Fixed bulk assignment of guests to processes, which previously showed an error when trying to assign existing guests from your organization.
- **[UI]** Fixed overly aggressive form validation that immediately showed red error messages when opening tasks - now validation appears only after you interact with fields or try to complete the task.
- **[UI]** Fixed document template editor breaking when using template snippets, ensuring text fields stay properly formatted and accessible on all screen sizes.
- **[UI]** Process names with multiple spaces now save correctly when creating or editing templates and processes.
- **[UI]** Fixed comment counts on tasks to update instantly when you delete comments, so you see accurate numbers right away.
- **[UI]** Fixed activity trail text overflow in homepage sections so long content now stays properly contained within its borders.
- **[UI]** Made task icons display consistent colors across all views, so you can easily distinguish between template steps and active process tasks.
- **[UI]** Fixed password settings appearing for users who sign in with Google, Microsoft, or SSO, eliminating confusion since these users don't need Tallyfy passwords.
- **[UI]** Fixed masquerade mode so administrators can now reliably withdraw member invitations without getting "Member not found" errors.
- **[UI]** Fixed newly created guest users now appearing instantly in assignment lists without needing to refresh your browser.
