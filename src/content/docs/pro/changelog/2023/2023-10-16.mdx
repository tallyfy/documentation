### Changes

- **[UI]** Activity feeds now display as searchable tables with built-in filtering by date and person, plus CSV export for easier audit trails.

- **[UI]** Simplified the template editing sidebar to show only the most important step details, making it easier to focus on what matters most.
- **[UI]** Launching processes with guests is now smoother - just press Enter after typing email addresses instead of clicking an extra "Add Guests" button.
- **[UI]** Improved workflow automations now support multiple conditions with multiple actions, better date handling, and enhanced assignment options for more flexible process automation.
- **[UI]** Clarified that date fields can automatically default to current date and time using the existing "Default Content" feature in form settings.

### Bug Fixes

- **[UI]** Fixed "Invite New Member" button not updating immediately when switching languages in Settings - now all text changes instantly without refreshing the page.
- **[UI]** Fixed misaligned "DISCARD CHANGES" and "SAVE CHANGES" buttons in the template editor for a cleaner, more professional interface.
- **[UI]** Fixed right-click functionality in Universal Search so you can now open template results in new tabs, making it easier to compare multiple templates.
- **[UI]** Fixed template editor drawers not opening when clicking deadline, assignee, or view forms for email task types, so editing these steps now works smoothly.
- **[UI]** Form field automations now work properly with table fields, ensuring your "if this then that" rules trigger correctly when conditions are met.
- **[UI]** Made automations more reliable and responsive after identifying and fixing several issues following our latest major UI improvements.
- **[UI]** Fixed hover effects and loading position glitches in the template folder dropdown for smoother navigation.
- **[UI]** Fixed table exports to include all your data instead of just the rows visible on screen, so you get complete CSV and Excel files every time.
- **[UI]** Fixed buttons and menus cutting off text in Spanish, German, French and other languages by making them automatically resize to fit the translated content.
- **[UI]** Fixed tag filter dropdown to properly close when clicked again, so you don't have to click elsewhere to dismiss it.
