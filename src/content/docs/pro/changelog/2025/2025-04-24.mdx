### Changes

- **[UI]** [Template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) editor now shows [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) icons only when steps are affected by rules, making it clearer which automations impact each step.
- **[API]** [Process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) names can now be up to 550 characters long, so your detailed [variable](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/) names won't get cut off anymore.
- **[API]** New users now receive a personalized welcome [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) with helpful guidance instead of a confusing default [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) when joining Tallyfy.
- **[API]** Upgraded our cloud infrastructure to a more flexible and cost-effective system, improving platform reliability and performance for all users.
- **[API]** Added a new "Watching" feature that lets you track changes to [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), and team [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) with customizable notification timing - get alerts instantly, every 3 hours, or daily.

### Bug Fixes

- **[UI]** Fixed visual overlap issue where the trial expiration warning bar was covering header content for a cleaner interface.
- **[UI]** Fixed radio button selections that were incorrectly showing "Invalid radio choice selected" errors due to duplicate option IDs.
- **[UI]** Fixed workflow visualization glitches that temporarily duplicated [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) and scrambled task order when adding linked content or milestones.
- **[API]** Fixed favorited items disappearing from your favorites list when they get archived, deleted, or deactivated so your lists stay clean and accurate.

### Performance

- **[API]** Performance optimizations were evaluated and tested to ensure Tallyfy continues running at optimal speed for all users.
