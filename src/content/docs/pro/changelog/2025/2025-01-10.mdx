### New Features

- **[API]** Form fields now support variables like DATE and TEMPLATE_NAME in default content, automatically filling in current information when you launch processes.
- **[API]** You can now assign roles to multiple steps at once instead of editing them one by one, making template setup much faster.

### Bug Fixes

- **[API]** Fixed task completion webhooks that were failing to send notifications when tasks were marked as complete, ensuring reliable automation triggers.
- **[API]** Fixed a conflict that prevented completing tasks when both "inject tasks" and "launch process" automations used the same template, ensuring your automations work reliably together.
- **[API]** Date fields in forms now display consistently across all user views, eliminating confusion from timezone variations.
- **[API]** Fixed date formatting errors for guests viewing tasks with custom date fields, ensuring dates now display correctly in their local timezone.
- **[API]** Fixed milestone positioning in Action Plan view when launching templates, ensuring milestones now display in their correct order.
- **[API]** Form field prefixes and suffixes (like "$" and "houses") now display consistently in task summaries and completed tasks for better context.
- **[API]** Fixed email links for watched items so clicking them now properly takes you to your Favorites page instead of a blank screen.

### Performance

- **[API]** Doubled cache duration from 30 to 60 seconds, making pages load faster and improving protection against traffic spikes.
