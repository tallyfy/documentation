### New Features

- **[UI]** Added [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) filtering to the [Tracker Board view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/) so you can quickly focus on [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) from specific templates without creating presets.
- **[API]** You can now create steps with no assignee using the new "Nobody right now" option, giving you more flexibility in your process design.

### Changes

- **[UI]** You can now upload flowcharts in Word or PDF format to automatically create [procedure templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), with AI detecting and converting shapes into workflow steps.
- **[UI]** Updated dropdown menus across the app for better consistency and a more polished user experience.
- **[UI]** Updated the preview icon in Library view to match Template Editor for a more consistent visual experience.
- **[UI]** Improved [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) with visual identifiers, search filters, and cleaner interface to help you find and manage your "if this then that" rules faster.
- **[UI]** Simplified product display by keeping focus on our core workflow automation product instead of adding unnecessary multi-product icons.
- **[UI]** People pickers now show all available [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) in a dropdown list, making it easier to assign [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) without needing to guess names.
- **[UI]** [Form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) placeholder text now provides clearer guidance instead of duplicating header text, making forms easier to understand and fill out.
- **[UI]** Made [template folder](/products/pro/documenting/templates/organize-templates-into-folders/) creation clearer by replacing confusing button placement with improved global library filters for better organization.
- **[UI]** Replaced "Favorites" with "Watching" so you can now watch [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), and [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) with customizable email notifications (immediate, hourly, or daily).
- **[API]** Verified that owner reassignment data for [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), and [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) works correctly through our [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) as expected.
- **[API]** Email notifications now feature a cleaner, more professional design with improved mobile display and no horizontal scrolling issues.

### Bug Fixes

- **[UI]** Fixed slow [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) loading and UI performance issues caused by Chrome's QUIC protocol conflicts with our static assets.
- **[UI]** Fixed [document templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) getting stuck on loading screen when using AI generation - now generates smoothly every time.
- **[UI]** Fixed filter display in [Tracker view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/) so your saved Tags and Template presets now show the correct values when editing instead of showing "Select an option".
- **[UI]** Fixed print preview filters so unchecking "Show step numbers" and "Show automation" now properly hides those elements when printing [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).
- **[UI]** Added grouping options to the [Tasks view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/) so you can organize your [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) by process, assignee, or deadline instead of seeing one long list.
- **[UI]** Fixed organization switching to remember your last selected organization when reopening Tallyfy, eliminating extra clicks for multi-organization users.
- **[API]** Fixed instant activation of paid subscriptions so your team gets immediate access instead of waiting up to 30 minutes.
- **[API]** Fixed a database update issue that was preventing some workflow [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) from being properly duplicated, ensuring reliable template cloning functionality.
- **[API]** Fixed a bug that was preventing users from viewing step details, ensuring smooth access to all step information.
- **[API]** Fixed [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) data sorting by creation date so you can now properly organize guest users chronologically.
- **[API]** Fixed email delivery issues by strengthening security against spam attacks and improving system reliability.

### Deprecated
