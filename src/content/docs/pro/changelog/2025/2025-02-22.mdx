### New Features

- **[UI]** Users now receive automatic email notifications when their disabled accounts are reactivated, including login details and who restored access.

### Bug Fixes

- **[UI]** Fixed dropdown menus in Tracker table view that were appearing at the top of screen instead of next to their buttons.
- **[UI]** Fixed bulk editing tools to show helpful messages instead of empty screens when templates don't have steps yet, and made them work immediately after adding new steps.
- **[UI]** Fixed date field validation to prevent process access errors and ensure date defaults save properly in templates.
- **[UI]** Fixed form date fields to properly calculate past dates when using "current date minus days" - previously only worked for future dates.
- **[API]** Fixed a temporary file loading issue during deployments that could briefly interrupt service, ensuring smoother system updates.

### Performance

- **[API]** Fixed slow loading times when viewing checklist details, reducing wait times from 13 seconds to under 3 seconds for a smoother experience.
