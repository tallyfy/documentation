### Changes

- **[UI]** Improved auto-archive timing to better align with the configured one-day delay for completed processes.

### Bug Fixes

- **[UI]** Fixed public knowledge sharing links that stopped working when form names were too long, ensuring your shared content stays accessible to everyone.
- **[UI]** Fixed error message that incorrectly appeared when creating or editing form fields, making dropdown and validation settings work smoothly again.
- **[UI]** Fixed unwanted horizontal scrollbars appearing across pages that made the Template Editor harder to use on Windows and Mac devices.
- **[UI]** Fixed multiple member selection in Tracker's "Assigned" filter so you can now properly select and save multiple team members without losing your choices.
- **[UI]** Fixed step reordering so dragging and dropping steps in templates now saves positions correctly and stays put after refreshing the page.
