### New Features

- **[UI]** You can now create [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) with no assignee and filter to see only unassigned tasks, giving you more flexibility in how work gets distributed.
- **[UI]** New AI-powered flowchart converter instantly transforms your existing process diagrams into ready-to-use workflow [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), dramatically speeding up your setup time.

### Changes

- **[UI]** We improved our development workflow with AI-powered code generation tools, helping us build and ship features faster for you.

### Bug Fixes

- **[UI]** Fixed [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) launching when using table [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) in [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/), which previously failed whether the table had data or was empty.

- **[UI]** Fixed missing toggle button in [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) step timings so you can now properly switch between "Start On-time" and "Start Anytime" modes.

- **[UI]** Fixed milestone creation in task edit mode so the text cursor now stays properly focused in the input field.

- **[UI]** Fixed confusing display where removed users still appeared as [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) owners on the [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) deactivation screen, making ownership changes clearer.
- **[UI]** Fixed missing Settings option on iPad landscape view by adding scrolling to the sidebar when screen space is limited.

- **[API]** Fixed checklist loading errors that occurred when accessing certain [organization settings](/products/pro/settings/org-settings/), ensuring checklists now display reliably for all users.

### Deprecated

### Removed
