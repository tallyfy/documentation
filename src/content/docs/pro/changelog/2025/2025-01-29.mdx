### Bug Fixes

- **[UI]** Document print previews now hide empty form fields instead of showing distracting green sections, creating cleaner and more professional PDF exports.
- **[UI]** Fixed auto-naming to respect the 300-character limit when launching processes, preventing errors and showing clear warnings before you launch.
