### Changes

- **[UI]** Task status now clearly shows "Completed Late" when tasks finish past their due date, making it easier to spot delays at a glance.

### Bug Fixes

- **[UI]** Fixed confusing labels in Active Process view - kick off forms now clearly show "KICK OFF FORM" instead of the process name for better clarity.
- **[UI]** Fixed awkward line breaks in the "Resolve issue" button text to match the clean single-line display used elsewhere.
- **[UI]** Fixed incorrect error message when inviting members to groups - invites now work smoothly without confusing validation warnings.
- **[UI]** Fixed dropdown arrow alignment in the company type field when creating templates with Tallyfy AI for a cleaner, more polished interface.
- **[UI]** Date form fields now display consistently for all users regardless of timezone, preventing dates from appearing shifted by one day.
- **[UI]** Light users now see a cleaner interface with only the actions they can actually perform when viewing processes in Tracker.
- **[UI]** Fixed dropdown menus in form builder that were appearing behind other buttons when you had 5 or more options, making them easier to select.
- **[UI]** Member profiles in Settings now load reliably, making it easier to manage and deactivate users without interruption.
- **[UI]** Fixed prefixes and suffixes for text and dropdown fields to display correctly across all templates and completed tasks.
- **[UI]** Fixed one-off tasks to show the normal view instead of automatically opening in edit mode when created, making the experience clearer and less confusing.
- **[UI]** Fixed duplicated tasks staying permanently hidden - now duplicated tasks appear visible by default when automation conditions change.

### Performance

- **[UI]** Improved dropdown performance for large option lists by optimizing data loading, with enhanced search capabilities coming in our upcoming UI upgrade.
