### New Features

- **[UI]** Added a new automation type that lets you pass variables from your current process to name and populate fields in newly launched processes, making process chaining more flexible.

### Changes

- **[UI]** "Everyone must complete" tasks now clearly show who's finished and who's still working, making it easier to track team progress at a glance.

### Bug Fixes

- **[UI]** Fixed persistent "Email not found in organization" error that was incorrectly appearing across Tasks, processes, and Settings pages.
- **[UI]** Fixed automation rules to show correct step numbers in the "THEN" section, making it easier to set up accurate workflow triggers.
- **[UI]** Fixed date form fields to display the same date for all users, preventing dates from shifting by one day when guests and members are in different timezones.
- **[UI]** Milestones now stay in the correct order when duplicating templates and launching processes, eliminating the need to manually reorder them.
