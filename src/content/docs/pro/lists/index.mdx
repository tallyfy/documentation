## What are Lists?

Lists are reusable data tables in Tallyfy. Create them once, then reference them across any template or process - so you never retype the same data.

They work as a single source of truth for recurring data like vendor names, product codes, or approval chains. This cuts data entry errors and keeps information consistent across your organization.

### Why use Lists?

Stop typing the same vendor names, product codes, or approval chains in every workflow. With Lists, you define that data once and pull it wherever it's needed.

Each List is a structured table with custom columns, rows, and individual cells you can update at any time. Changes apply everywhere the List is referenced.

### How Lists connect to other features

Lists plug into several parts of Tallyfy:

- **Form fields** - Dropdown, multiselect, and radio fields can pull their options directly from a List, so you don't have to maintain options manually
- **Templates** - Reference List data for consistent process setup across your organization
- **Variables** - Populate variables from List values for dynamic content in your workflows
- **Automations** - Use List data in conditional logic and routing rules

### Common use cases

- **Vendor directories** - Supplier info, contact details, and procurement approval paths
- **Product catalogs** - Item codes, descriptions, and pricing
- **Employee roles** - Job titles, departments, and permission levels
- **Location data** - Office addresses, regions, and local requirements
- **Approval hierarchies** - Management chains and escalation paths
- **Compliance requirements** - Regulatory codes, standards, and procedures

### Getting started

To set up a List:

1. Create a new List with custom columns for your data
2. Add rows of data - or import from an existing source
3. Connect the List to form fields (dropdown, multiselect, or radio) in your templates
4. Update the List centrally - changes reflect across all linked processes
