## Store and reuse data with Lists

**Lists** in Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> let you create centralized collections of structured data that you can reference and reuse throughout your [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) and [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). Think of Lists as your organization's reference tables that ensure consistent data entry and reduce manual work.

:::note[Feature coming soon]
Lists functionality is currently in development and will be available soon. This documentation section is being prepared in advance of the feature release.

### Why Lists matter for workflow efficiency

Lists solve the common problem of repeatedly entering the same information across different workflows. Instead of manually typing vendor names, product codes, or approval steps every time, you can create a List once and reference it wherever needed.

This approach reduces errors, saves time, and ensures everyone uses the same standardized information across your organization's processes.

### How Lists work with Tallyfy features

Lists integrate seamlessly with existing Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> functionality:

- **[Form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/)** can pull options from Lists instead of requiring manual entry
- **[Templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)** can reference List data for consistent process setup
- **[Variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/)** can be populated from List values
- **[Automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/)** can use List data for conditional logic

### Common use cases for Lists

Organizations typically use Lists for:

- **Vendor directories** - Store supplier information, contact details, and approval workflows
- **Product catalogs** - Maintain item codes, descriptions, and pricing information
- **Employee roles** - Define job titles, departments, and permission levels
- **Location data** - Keep office addresses, regions, and local requirements
- **Approval hierarchies** - Set up management chains and escalation paths
- **Compliance requirements** - Store regulatory codes, standards, and procedures

### Getting started with Lists

When Lists becomes available, you'll be able to:

1. Create structured data tables with custom columns
2. Import existing data from spreadsheets or databases  
3. Connect List data to form fields and template variables
4. Update Lists centrally to reflect changes across all processes
5. Control access permissions for List viewing and editing

Lists will provide a powerful foundation for data-driven workflows while maintaining the simplicity that makes Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> easy to use.
