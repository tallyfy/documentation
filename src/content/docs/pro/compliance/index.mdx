## Enterprise security and compliance framework

Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> maintains enterprise-grade security infrastructure and comprehensive data protection protocols. Our platform adheres to rigorous compliance standards and industry-leading security frameworks. This section details our cybersecurity governance and compliance methodology.

### SOC 2 Type 2 compliance certification

Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> has successfully achieved SOC 2 Type 2 compliance certification through comprehensive third-party security assessments of our business process management platform.

- **Assessment Period:** This compliance evaluation encompassed **May 21, 2024, to August 21, 2024**.
- **Scope Coverage:** The assessment evaluated **Security** controls according to AICPA Trust Services Criteria frameworks.
- **Independent Auditor:** Prescient Assurance LLC conducted the comprehensive security compliance assessment.
- **Compliance Status:** Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> maintains continuous SOC 2 Type 2 adherence through systematic monitoring and annual certification renewals. The subsequent assessment cycle concludes **August 21, 2025**.

This SOC 2 Type 2 attestation validates Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> security control effectiveness and operational reliability over the specified evaluation period.

### Security governance framework

Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> implements comprehensive cybersecurity measures aligned with industry-standard data protection frameworks. Our security architecture encompasses:

#### Identity and access management

- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Users receive access exclusively to resources essential for designated role functions.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication:** Authentication protocols require unique credentials supplemented by secondary verification mechanisms for enhanced security across critical infrastructure.
- **Access Reviews:** Systematic privilege audits occur annually for standard users and quarterly for elevated access permissions, ensuring appropriate authorization alignment.
- **Environment Segregation:** Development, testing, and production systems maintain strict isolation. Production access requires explicit authorization protocols.

#### Enterprise Single Sign-On enforcement

Organizations demanding heightened authentication security can configure Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> for mandatory "SSO-only" access. This enforcement mode ensures:

*   Complete authentication routing through designated Single Sign-On providers without alternative access methods.
*   Comprehensive disabling of traditional email-password authentication across organizational accounts.
*   Centralized user provisioning exclusively through SSO identity providers, eliminating direct email invitation capabilities.

This configuration ensures complete adherence to corporate identity governance policies while streamlining administrative oversight. Organizations can enable mandatory SSO through [Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> support channels](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/).

#### Data security protocols

- **Transport Layer Encryption:** Data transmission utilizes robust encryption protocols (TLS 1.2 or higher) ensuring secure communication channels between client systems and Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> infrastructure.
- **Data-at-Rest Protection:** Information stored within AWS-hosted infrastructure receives comprehensive encryption protection using enterprise-grade security algorithms.
- **Tenant Isolation:** Organizational data maintains logical separation through unique identifier-based segregation mechanisms.

#### Operational security management

- **Vulnerability Assessment:** Regular security scanning and annual penetration testing by external specialists identify and address potential system weaknesses.
- **Change Control Procedures:** Infrastructure modifications undergo systematic development, testing, review, and approval protocols before implementation.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Real-time system surveillance through AWS CloudWatch and GuardDuty detects performance anomalies, availability issues, and suspicious activities with immediate alerting capabilities.
- **Incident Response Framework:** Documented security incident procedures undergo regular testing and refinement to ensure rapid response capabilities.

#### Third-party risk management

- **Vendor Security Assessment:** Third-party relationships undergo comprehensive security evaluations before engagement, with periodic reassessment protocols.
- **Supply Chain Oversight:** Critical infrastructure partners, including AWS, undergo regular compliance review through SOC 2 assessments and security documentation evaluation. According to [industry research](https://www.brightdefense.com/resources/soc-2-compliance-requirements-your-essential-2024-overview/), SOC 2 adoption increased 40% in 2024, reflecting growing enterprise security requirements.
