## Key Security Practices

We implement a comprehensive set of security controls aligned with industry best practices to safeguard our systems and your data. Key areas include:

### Access Control

- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Access is granted based on roles and responsibilities, ensuring users only have the permissions necessary for their job functions.
- **Authentication:** Unique user credentials and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) are enforced for access to sensitive systems.
- **Regular Access Reviews:** User access rights, particularly for privileged accounts, are reviewed periodically (annually for users, quarterly for privileged access) and adjusted as needed.
- **Separation of Duties:** Development, testing, and production environments are segregated, and access controls prevent developers from accessing production infrastructure without approval.

### Data Protection

- **Encryption in Transit:** All data transmitted over public networks, including between users and the Tallyfy platform, is encrypted using TLS 1.2 or higher.
- **Encryption at Rest:** Customer data stored within our AWS infrastructure (e.g., databases, file storage) is encrypted using industry-standard algorithms.
- **Data Segregation:** Customer data is logically separated using unique organization identifiers.

### System Security and Operations

- **Vulnerability Management:** We conduct regular vulnerability scans and annual third-party penetration tests to identify and remediate potential security weaknesses.
- **Change Management:** A formal change management process ensures that changes to the platform and infrastructure are developed, tested, reviewed, and approved before deployment.
- **Monitoring:** Systems are continuously monitored for performance, availability, and security threats using tools like AWS CloudWatch and GuardDuty. Intrusion detection systems are in place to identify and alert on suspicious activity.
- **Incident Response:** We maintain a documented Incident Response Plan and conduct regular training and testing to ensure readiness for security incidents.

### Vendor Management

- **Due Diligence:** Third-party vendors undergo a security review process before engagement and periodically thereafter.
- **Subservice Organization Monitoring:** We review the compliance reports (e.g., SOC 2) of critical subservice providers like AWS.
