## What security and compliance does Tallyfy provide?

Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> delivers SOC 2 Type 2 certified security with bank-level encryption, mandatory SSO options, and complete audit trails that meet the strictest regulatory requirements. You're getting robust security for your workflows - the kind that passes compliance audits without breaking a sweat.

Here's everything you need to know about our security certifications, audit capabilities, and data protection.

### What is Tallyfy's SOC 2 Type 2 compliance certification?

We've got SOC 2 Type 2 certification - and yes, it's the real deal. This means an independent auditor spent three months examining every aspect of our security controls to verify they actually work as advertised.

- **Assessment Period:** Our most recent audit covered **May 21, 2024, to August 21, 2024**.
- **Scope Coverage:** The assessment tested **Security** controls based on AICPA Trust Services Criteria (the gold standard for SaaS security).
- **Independent Auditor:** Prescient Assurance LLC handled the audit - they're tough, thorough, and don't miss a thing.
- **Compliance Status:** We maintain continuous SOC 2 Type 2 compliance with annual renewals. Our next assessment wraps up **August 21, 2025**.

What does this mean for you? Simple. Our security isn't just documented - it's tested, proven, and working round the clock.

Current customers and prospective clients operating under Non-Disclosure Agreements may request comprehensive compliance documentation through our Tallyfy sales or support channels.

### How does Tallyfy support regulatory audit trail requirements?

If you're in a regulated industry, you know the drill - auditors want to see everything. Who did what, when they did it, and what changed. Tallyfy tracks all of this automatically, creating an unbreakable chain of evidence for every single workflow action. No gaps, no guesswork.

#### What audit trail capabilities does Tallyfy provide?

- **Complete Process Documentation:** Every single step gets timestamped with the exact user and outcome - like a security camera for your workflows
- **Immutable Record Keeping:** Once something happens, it's locked in stone. Nobody can delete or modify audit records (not even admins)
- **User Activity Logging:** See exactly who clicked what button at 3:47 PM last Tuesday - it's all there
- **Export Capabilities:** Generate audit reports in seconds when regulators come knocking
- **Version Control:** Track every template change with who made it and why - perfect for those "why did we change this process?" moments

#### Which regulated industries benefit from Tallyfy's audit trail features?

Here's a reality check - if you're in any of these industries, you can't afford to have gaps in your audit trails:

**Financial Services Compliance:**
- Asset management firms dealing with SEC Rules 204-2 and 206(4)-7 (trust us, those auditors check everything)
- Banks navigating FINRA's audit requirements - where missing documentation means hefty fines
- Insurance companies tracking every claim decision and approval

**Healthcare and Life Sciences:**
- Pharma companies following FDA 21 CFR Part 11 - where a missing signature can derail drug approval
- Clinical research teams meeting ICH E6(R3) standards for trial documentation
- Medical device manufacturers proving ISO 13485 compliance with every design change
- Healthcare IT maintaining those mandatory HIPAA audit logs

**Manufacturing and Safety-Critical Industries:**
- Auto manufacturers tracking every part change for IATF 16949:2016
- Aviation maintenance shops where FAA AC 145-9A compliance is literally life-or-death
- Nuclear facilities following 10 CFR 50 Appendix B (because nobody wants surprises there)
- Chemical plants meeting OSHA's Process Safety Management requirements

**Infrastructure and Utilities:**
- Power companies dealing with NERC CIP cybersecurity audits
- Railroads documenting track inspections per 49 CFR 213
- Mining operations proving MSHA workplace examinations actually happened

The common thread? These organizations need bulletproof documentation showing "who did what, when" - and that's exactly what Tallyfy delivers. Automatically. Want specifics for your industry?

### What security governance framework does Tallyfy use?

We don't just talk security - we live it. Our entire platform runs on battle-tested security principles that would make your CISO smile.

Here's how we lock things down:

#### How does Tallyfy manage identity and access?

- **Principle of Least Privilege:** You only see what you need to see. Marketing can't peek at HR workflows, and finance can't browse sales templates. It's that simple.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication:** Password alone? Not enough. You'll need that second factor (like your phone) to get in. Every time.
- **Access Reviews:** We audit permissions like clockwork - annually for regular users, quarterly for admins. No zombie accounts hanging around here.
- **Environment Segregation:** Our developers can't touch your production data even if they wanted to. Dev, test, and production are completely walled off from each other.

#### How does Tallyfy enforce Single Sign-On?

Got strict authentication requirements? We've got you covered. You can lock down Tallyfy to accept logins ONLY through your company's SSO provider. No backdoors, no exceptions.

Here's what SSO-only mode gives you:

*   Every single login goes through your SSO provider - period. No sneaky password logins allowed.
*   Email-password authentication? Completely disabled for everyone in your organization.
*   User management happens in one place - your identity provider. No more chasing down rogue email invites.

This setup makes your security team happy (one authentication system to rule them all) and your IT team even happier (way less password reset tickets).

Ready to flip the switch? Contact [Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/) and we'll get you set up.

:::note[Advanced SSO for AI Integrations]
For organizations implementing AI workflows, [SSO integration with MCP servers](/products/pro/integrations/mcp-server/sso-authentication/) extends identity governance to AI-powered applications, ensuring centralized authentication across both traditional workflow systems and emerging AI tools.

#### What data security protocols does Tallyfy use?

- **Transport Layer Encryption:** Everything moving between you and Tallyfy uses TLS 1.2+ encryption. Think of it as an armored truck for your data - nobody's peeking inside during transit.
- **Data-at-Rest Protection:** Your data sitting in our AWS servers? Encrypted with AES-256. That's military-grade protection for your workflows.
- **Tenant Isolation:** Your organization's data lives in its own secure bubble. Even if another company uses the same server, they can't see your stuff (and you can't see theirs).

#### How does Tallyfy manage operational security?

- **Vulnerability Assessment:** We hire ethical hackers to attack our systems annually (yes, on purpose). Plus regular automated scans catch issues before the bad guys do.
- **Change Control Procedures:** Nobody pushes code straight to production - not even our CEO. Every change goes through dev, testing, review, then approval. No cowboys here.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** AWS CloudWatch and GuardDuty watch our systems 24/7. If something looks fishy at 3 AM on Sunday, our team gets pinged immediately.
- **Incident Response Framework:** We've got a battle plan for security incidents (and yes, we practice it). Think fire drills, but for cyber threats.

#### How does Tallyfy manage third-party risks?

- **Vendor Security Assessment:** Before any vendor touches our systems, they go through security vetting. And it's not a one-time thing - we recheck them regularly because trust needs verification.
- **Supply Chain Oversight:** Our infrastructure runs on AWS, and we review their SOC 2 reports religiously. Fun fact: According to [industry research](https://www.brightdefense.com/resources/soc-2-compliance-requirements-your-essential-2024-overview/)<a href="https://www.brightdefense.com/resources/soc-2-compliance-requirements-your-essential-2024-overview/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, SOC 2 adoption jumped 40% in 2024. Why? Because companies like yours demand proof, not promises.
