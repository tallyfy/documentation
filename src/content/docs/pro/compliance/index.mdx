## Security and compliance overview

Tallyfy is SOC 2 Type 2 certified with bank-level encryption, SSO enforcement options, and complete audit trails for regulatory needs. As an [independent, profitable company](/products/pro/miscellaneous/about-tallyfy/), we invest heavily in security.

### SOC 2 Type 2 certification

Tallyfy maintains SOC 2 Type 2 certification - an independent auditor examines our security controls over a rolling three-month period.

- **Assessment period:** Rolling three-month periods with continuous assessment
- **Scope:** **Security** controls based on AICPA Trust Services Criteria[^1]
- **Independent auditor:** A third-party audit firm handles each assessment
- **Status:** Continuous SOC 2 Type 2 compliance with annual renewals

:::note[Getting the SOC 2 report]
Current customers and prospective clients under NDAs can request full compliance documentation through Tallyfy sales or support.

### Audit trail

Tallyfy tracks all workflow actions automatically - who did what, when, and what changed.

#### What's tracked

- **Timestamped steps:** Every step records the user, time, and outcome
- **Immutable records:** Audit records can't be deleted or modified, not even by admins
- **Activity logging:** Full visibility into every user action
- **Exports:** Generate audit reports for regulatory compliance
- **Template version control:** Track all template changes with author and reason

#### Regulated industries using Tallyfy

**Financial services:**
- Asset management firms meeting SEC Rules 204-2 and 206(4)-7
- Banks complying with FINRA audit requirements
- Insurance companies tracking claim decisions and approvals

**Healthcare and life sciences:**
- Pharma companies following FDA 21 CFR Part 11[^2]
- Clinical research teams meeting ICH E6(R3) standards
- Medical device manufacturers proving ISO 13485 compliance
- Healthcare IT maintaining HIPAA audit logs

**Manufacturing and safety-critical industries:**
- Auto manufacturers tracking part changes for IATF 16949:2016
- Aviation maintenance shops meeting FAA AC 145-9A
- Nuclear facilities following 10 CFR 50 Appendix B
- Chemical plants meeting OSHA Process Safety Management requirements

**Infrastructure and utilities:**
- Power companies handling NERC CIP cybersecurity audits
- Railroads documenting track inspections per 49 CFR 213
- Mining operations proving MSHA workplace examinations

All these industries need documented proof of "who did what, when." See [industry-specific workflow applications](/products/pro/tutorials/industry-specific-workflow-applications/) for details.

### PCI-DSS considerations

**Tallyfy isn't PCI-DSS certified** - we don't process payment card data directly. You can still use Tallyfy in PCI-compliant environments:

- **Never store card data in Tallyfy** - don't enter credit card numbers, CVVs, or payment data in form fields
- **Use tokenization** - store only tokenized references from your payment processor
- **Use compensating controls** - Tallyfy's audit trails and access controls support your PCI compliance program
- **Separate systems** - keep payment processing separate from workflow management

Consult your QSA (Qualified Security Assessor) about including Tallyfy in your cardholder data environment.

### Security governance

Tallyfy applies enterprise security principles across the product.

#### Identity and access management

- **Least privilege:** Users only access workflows relevant to their role (Admin, Standard, or Light)
- **Role-based access:** Three distinct permission levels control what each user can see and do
- **Access reviews:** Regular permission audits for users and admins
- **Environment segregation:** Full separation between development, test, and production

#### Single Sign-On enforcement

Tallyfy can restrict login exclusively to your SSO provider. SSO-only mode means:

*   All logins go through your SSO provider only
*   Email-password login is disabled organization-wide
*   User management stays centralized in your identity provider

To enable SSO-only mode, contact [Tallyfy support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/).

:::note[Advanced SSO for AI integrations]
If you're using AI workflows, [SSO integration with MCP servers](/products/pro/integrations/mcp-server/sso-authentication/) extends identity governance to AI-powered applications - centralized authentication across both workflow systems and AI tools.
:::

#### Data security

- **Transport encryption:** TLS 1.2+ for all data in transit
- **At-rest encryption:** AES-256 for stored data on AWS servers
- **Tenant isolation:** Complete data separation between organizations

#### Operational security

- **Vulnerability testing:** Annual penetration testing plus automated security scanning
- **Change control:** All code changes go through development, testing, review, and approval before production
- **Continuous monitoring:** AWS CloudWatch and GuardDuty provide 24/7 monitoring with alerting
- **Incident response:** Documented and tested security incident response procedures

#### Third-party risk

- **Vendor assessment:** Security vetting required for all vendors with regular reassessments
- **Supply chain oversight:** Regular review of AWS SOC 2 reports and vendor security documentation
