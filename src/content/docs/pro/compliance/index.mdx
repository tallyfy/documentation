## Security and compliance overview

Tallyfy delivers SOC 2 Type 2 certified security with bank-level encryption, mandatory SSO options, and complete audit trails that meet regulatory requirements.

### SOC 2 Type 2 certification

Tallyfy maintains SOC 2 Type 2 certification. An independent auditor examines our security controls over a three-month period.

- **Assessment Period:** Our most recent audit covered **May 21, 2024, to August 21, 2024**.
- **Scope Coverage:** The assessment tested **Security** controls based on AICPA Trust Services Criteria[^1] (the gold standard for SaaS security).
- **Independent Auditor:** Prescient Assurance LLC handled the audit - they're tough, thorough, and don't miss a thing.
- **Compliance Status:** We maintain continuous SOC 2 Type 2 compliance with annual renewals. Our next assessment wraps up **August 21, 2025**.

Current customers and prospective clients operating under Non-Disclosure Agreements may request comprehensive compliance documentation through our Tallyfy sales or support channels.

### Regulatory audit trail requirements

Tallyfy tracks all workflow actions automatically, creating a complete audit trail showing who did what, when they did it, and what changed.

#### Audit trail capabilities

- **Complete Process Documentation:** Every step gets timestamped with user and outcome
- **Immutable Record Keeping:** Once something happens, it's locked in stone. Nobody can delete or modify audit records (not even admins)
- **User Activity Logging:** See exactly who clicked what button at 3:47 PM last Tuesday - it's all there
- **Export Capabilities:** Generate audit reports for regulatory compliance
- **Version Control:** Track all template changes with author and reason

#### Regulated industries using Tallyfy

**Financial Services Compliance:**
- Asset management firms meeting SEC Rules 204-2 and 206(4)-7
- Banks complying with FINRA audit requirements
- Insurance companies tracking every claim decision and approval

**Healthcare and Life Sciences:**
- Pharma companies following FDA 21 CFR Part 11[^2]
- Clinical research teams meeting ICH E6(R3) standards for trial documentation
- Medical device manufacturers proving ISO 13485 compliance with every design change
- Healthcare IT maintaining those mandatory HIPAA audit logs

**Manufacturing and Safety-Critical Industries:**
- Auto manufacturers tracking every part change for IATF 16949:2016
- Aviation maintenance shops meeting FAA AC 145-9A compliance
- Nuclear facilities following 10 CFR 50 Appendix B
- Chemical plants meeting OSHA's Process Safety Management requirements

**Infrastructure and Utilities:**
- Power companies dealing with NERC CIP cybersecurity audits
- Railroads documenting track inspections per 49 CFR 213
- Mining operations proving MSHA workplace examinations actually happened

These organizations require complete documentation showing "who did what, when." For industry-specific details, see [industry-specific workflow applications](/products/pro/tutorials/industry-specific-workflow-applications/).

### PCI-DSS compliance considerations

**Tallyfy itself is not PCI-DSS certified** as we don't process payment card data directly. However, you can use Tallyfy in PCI-compliant environments by:

- **Never storing card data in Tallyfy** - Don't enter credit card numbers, CVV codes, or other sensitive payment data in form fields
- **Using tokenization** - Store only tokenized references from your payment processor
- **Implementing compensating controls** - Use Tallyfy's audit trails and access controls as part of your PCI compliance program
- **Separating systems** - Keep payment processing separate from workflow management

For organizations requiring PCI compliance, consult your QSA (Qualified Security Assessor) about using Tallyfy as part of your cardholder data environment.

### Security governance framework

Tallyfy implements enterprise security principles across the platform:

#### Identity and access management

- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Users only access workflows relevant to their role
- **Multi-Factor Authentication:** Required second factor authentication for all logins
- **Access Reviews:** Annual permission audits for users, quarterly for admins
- **Environment Segregation:** Complete separation between development, test, and production environments

#### Single Sign-On enforcement

Tallyfy can restrict authentication exclusively to your SSO provider. SSO-only mode provides:

*   All logins through your SSO provider only
*   Email-password authentication disabled organization-wide
*   Centralized user management through your identity provider

To enable SSO-only mode, contact [Tallyfy support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/).

:::note[Advanced SSO for AI Integrations]
For organizations implementing AI workflows, [SSO integration with MCP servers](/products/pro/integrations/mcp-server/sso-authentication/) extends identity governance to AI-powered applications, ensuring centralized authentication across both traditional workflow systems and emerging AI tools.
:::

#### Data security protocols

- **Transport Layer Encryption:** TLS 1.2+ encryption for all data in transit
- **Data-at-Rest Protection:** AES-256 encryption for stored data in AWS servers
- **Tenant Isolation:** Complete data separation between organizations

#### Operational security management

- **Vulnerability Assessment:** Annual penetration testing plus automated security scanning
- **Change Control Procedures:** All code changes require development, testing, review, and approval before production deployment
- **Continuous Monitoring:** AWS CloudWatch and GuardDuty provide 24/7 system monitoring with immediate alerting
- **Incident Response Framework:** Documented and tested security incident response procedures

#### Third-party risk management

- **Vendor Security Assessment:** Security vetting required for all vendors with regular reassessments
- **Supply Chain Oversight:** Regular review of AWS SOC 2 reports. According to [industry research](https://www.brightdefense.com/resources/soc-2-compliance-requirements-your-essential-2024-overview/)<a href="https://www.brightdefense.com/resources/soc-2-compliance-requirements-your-essential-2024-overview/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, SOC 2 adoption increased 40% in 2024.
