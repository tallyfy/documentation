## Tallyfy's security and compliance overview

Tallyfy works hard to keep your data safe and our platform reliable. We follow strict security and [compliance](/products/pro/compliance/) rules. This section explains our security checks and practices.

### SOC 2 Type 2 compliance

Tallyfy has passed a detailed security check-up called SOC 2 Type 2 for our workflow platform.

- **Check-up Period:** This review covered **May 21, 2024, to August 21, 2024**.
- **What Was Checked:** The check focused on **Security**, following rules set by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).
- **Who Checked:** An independent company, Prescient Assurance LLC, performed the check.
- **Current Status:** We keep meeting SOC 2 Type 2 standards through ongoing checks and yearly reviews. The next review period ends on **August 21, 2025**.

The SOC 2 Type 2 report gives details about Tallyfy's security measures and proves they work well.

:::note[Getting the SOC 2 Report]
If you are a current customer or a potential customer who has signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), you can ask for the full SOC 2 Type 2 report. Contact our sales or support team to request it.

### Key security practices

We use many security methods based on best practices to protect our systems and your data. Here are some key areas:

#### Access control (who can access what)

- **Only Necessary Access:** People get access only to the information and tools they need for their specific job, nothing more.
- **Logging In:** Everyone needs a unique login and password. We also use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), like a code sent to your phone, for extra security on important systems.
- **Regular Checks:** We review who has access to what regularly (yearly for most users, quarterly for those with high-level access) and make changes if needed.
- **Keeping Things Separate:** We keep the areas where we build, test, and run Tallyfy separate. Developers can't access the live system without special approval.

#### Data protection (keeping your information safe)

- **Secure Connections (Encryption in Transit):** When your data travels over the internet (like between your computer and Tallyfy), it's scrambled using strong encryption (TLS 1.2 or higher) so others can't read it.
- **Secure Storage (Encryption at Rest):** When your data is stored on our servers (using AWS), it's also scrambled using strong encryption methods.
- **Keeping Data Separate:** Each organization's data is kept separate using unique IDs.

#### System security and operations (how we run things securely)

- **Finding Weaknesses (Vulnerability Management):** We regularly scan our systems for any security weak spots. We also hire outside experts once a year to try and find issues (penetration tests).
- **Making Changes Carefully (Change Management):** Before we update Tallyfy or its systems, we follow a strict process to develop, test, review, and approve the changes.
- **Watching the Systems (Monitoring):** We constantly watch our systems to make sure they are working well, available, and secure. We use tools like AWS CloudWatch and GuardDuty to look for problems or suspicious activity and alert us.
- **Handling Problems (Incident Response):** We have a plan for what to do if a security problem happens. We practice this plan regularly so we're ready.

#### Vendor management (checking our partners)

- **Checking Vendors:** Before we work with other companies (vendors), we check their security practices. We review them regularly too.
- **Monitoring Key Partners:** We review the security reports (like SOC 2) of important partners we rely on, such as AWS (Amazon Web Services).
