## Tallyfy's security and compliance overview

Tallyfy works hard to keep data safe and our platform reliable. We follow strict security and [compliance](/products/pro/compliance/) rules. This section explains our security practices.

### SOC 2 Type 2 compliance

Tallyfy has passed a detailed security audit called SOC 2 Type 2 for our workflow platform.

- **Audit Period:** This review covered **May 21, 2024, to August 21, 2024**.
- **What Was Audited:** The audit focused on **Security**, following criteria set by the AICPA (American Institute of Certified Public Accountants).
- **Who Audited:** An independent company, Prescient Assurance LLC, performed the audit.
- **Current Status:** We continue to meet SOC 2 Type 2 standards through ongoing monitoring and annual audits. The next review period ends on **August 21, 2025**.

The SOC 2 Type 2 report details Tallyfy's security controls and proves their effectiveness.

### Key security practices

We use many security methods based on industry best practices to protect Tallyfy systems and your data. Key areas include:

#### Access control

- **Only Necessary Access:** Users get access only to information and tools needed for their job.
- **Logging In:** Users need a unique login and password. We also use multi-factor authentication (MFA), like a code sent to your phone, for extra security for key systems.
- **Regular Checks:** We regularly review who has access (yearly for most users, quarterly for privileged access) and adjust access as needed.
- **Keeping Things Separate:** We keep development, testing, and production environments separate. Developers cannot access production without specific approval.

#### Data protection

- **Secure Connections (Encryption in Transit):** When data travels over the internet (e.g., between your computer and Tallyfy), it's encrypted using strong methods (TLS 1.2 or higher) so others cannot read it.
- **Secure Storage (Encryption at Rest):** When data is stored on Tallyfy servers (using AWS), it's also encrypted using strong methods.
- **Keeping Data Separate:** Each organization's data is kept logically separate using unique IDs.

#### System security and operations

- **Finding Weaknesses (Vulnerability Management):** We regularly scan Tallyfy systems for security vulnerabilities. We also hire external experts annually to find issues (penetration testing).
- **Making Changes Carefully (Change Management):** Before updating Tallyfy or its infrastructure, we follow a strict process for development, testing, review, and approval.
- **Watching the Systems (Monitoring):** We constantly monitor our systems to ensure they are working well, available, and secure. We use tools like AWS CloudWatch and GuardDuty to look for issues or suspicious activity and alert us.
- **Handling problems (incident response):** We have a plan for handling security incidents. We regularly test this plan so we're prepared.

#### Vendor management

- **Checking Vendors:** Before working with other companies (vendors/sub-processors), we assess their security practices. We review them periodically too.
- **Monitoring Key Partners:** We review security reports (like SOC 2) of key sub-processors we rely on, such as AWS (Amazon Web Services).
