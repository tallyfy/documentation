### What security governance framework does Tallyfy use?

Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> implements comprehensive cybersecurity measures aligned with industry-standard data protection frameworks.

Our security architecture encompasses:

#### How does Tallyfy manage identity and access?

- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Users receive access only to resources essential for their specific role functions.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication:** All authentication requires both unique credentials and secondary verification (such as mobile device confirmation) for enhanced security.
- **Access Reviews:** We conduct systematic privilege audits annually for standard users and quarterly for administrative access, ensuring permissions remain appropriate.
- **Environment Segregation:** Development, testing, and production systems maintain complete isolation. Production access requires explicit authorization and justification.

#### How does Tallyfy enforce Enterprise Single Sign-On?

Organizations requiring enhanced authentication security can configure Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> for mandatory "SSO-only" access.

This enforcement mode provides:

*   All authentication routes through your designated Single Sign-On provider - no alternative access methods.
*   Complete disabling of traditional email-password authentication for all organizational accounts.
*   Centralized user provisioning exclusively through your SSO identity provider, preventing direct email invitations.

This configuration ensures strict adherence to corporate identity governance policies while simplifying user management.

Organizations can enable mandatory SSO through [Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> support channels](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/).

:::note[Advanced SSO for AI Integrations]
For organizations implementing AI workflows, [SSO integration with MCP servers](/products/pro/integrations/mcp-server/sso-authentication/) extends enterprise identity governance to AI-powered applications, ensuring centralized authentication across both traditional workflow systems and emerging AI tools.

#### What data security protocols does Tallyfy use?

- **Transport Layer Encryption:** All data transmission uses TLS 1.2 or higher encryption protocols, ensuring secure communication between your systems and Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> infrastructure.
- **Data-at-Rest Protection:** Your information stored in our AWS-hosted infrastructure receives comprehensive encryption using AES-256 algorithms.
- **Tenant Isolation:** Each organization's data remains logically separated through unique identifiers, preventing any cross-organization data access.

#### How does Tallyfy manage operational security?

- **Vulnerability Assessment:** We conduct regular security scanning and annual penetration testing with external specialists to identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities.
- **Change Control Procedures:** All infrastructure modifications follow a structured process - development, testing, review, and approval - before production deployment.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Real-time system surveillance through AWS CloudWatch and GuardDuty detects performance anomalies, availability issues, and suspicious activities, triggering immediate alerts.
- **Incident Response Framework:** Our documented security incident procedures undergo regular testing and updates to ensure rapid, effective response to any security events.

#### How does Tallyfy manage third-party risks?

- **Vendor Security Assessment:** All third-party vendors undergo comprehensive security evaluations before engagement, with periodic reassessments to maintain security standards.
- **Supply Chain Oversight:** Critical infrastructure partners, including AWS, undergo regular compliance reviews through SOC 2 assessments and security documentation evaluation. According to [industry research](https://www.brightdefense.com/resources/soc-2-compliance-requirements-your-essential-2024-overview/)<a href="https://www.brightdefense.com/resources/soc-2-compliance-requirements-your-essential-2024-overview/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, SOC 2 adoption increased 40% in 2024, reflecting growing enterprise security requirements.
