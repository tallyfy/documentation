Tallyfy uses BIMI to display a verified logo next to emails sent from `tallyfy.com`. If you see the Tallyfy logo in your inbox, that email is genuinely from us. No logo? Don't trust it.

### How does BIMI authentication work?

BIMI checks multiple forms of identity before showing our logo next to a message. Here's how it works:

<Steps>
1.  **Email authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC[^1]):**
    Three layers of authentication prove that emails from `tallyfy.com` actually come from Tallyfy's servers.

2.  **Strict DMARC policy:**
    Tallyfy tells email providers: "If an email claims it's from us but fails our checks, reject it." Scammers can't pretend to be Tallyfy - their fake emails get blocked before reaching you.

3.  **BIMI DNS record:**
    A special DNS record points email providers to our official logo file. This is how providers know which logo to display.

4.  **Verified Mark Certificate (VMC[^2]):**
    Tallyfy holds a VMC that cryptographically proves ownership of the logo. Only verified organizations obtain these certificates.

5.  **Logo display:**
    When Gmail or Outlook receives an email from `tallyfy.com`, it runs through all these checks. Pass every one? The logo appears. Fail any? No logo.
</Steps>

### What security benefits does BIMI give you?

*   **Instant trust signal:** See the Tallyfy logo? It's really us. No logo on an email claiming to be from Tallyfy? Delete it.
*   **Faster recognition:** The Tallyfy logo makes our emails stand out in a crowded inbox, so you can spot them quickly.
*   **Phishing resistance:** Over time, you'll instinctively expect the logo on legitimate Tallyfy emails - making fakes obvious.

### How does BIMI protect against cyber threats?

*   **Domain spoofing prevention:** Someone sends a fake "password reset" from a spoofed tallyfy.com address. No logo appears, and the email goes to spam.
*   **Phishing detection:** An urgent "Update your payment method NOW!" email arrives without the Tallyfy logo. That's your red flag - real Tallyfy emails always show the verified logo.
*   **Brand impersonation resistance:** Scammers can copy Tallyfy's website design, but they can't fake the BIMI certificate. Fraudulent emails are immediately identifiable by the missing logo.

### What should I know about custom SMTP settings?

:::caution[Using custom SMTP disables BIMI benefits]
When you configure Tallyfy to send emails via your **own email server (Custom SMTP)** instead of Tallyfy servers (`tallyfy.com`), the BIMI logo **will not appear** on those emails.

Emails sent through custom SMTP come from *your* servers, not Tallyfy's. Email providers check the actual origin, and since the email didn't come from `tallyfy.com`, no logo appears. You'd need your own BIMI setup with your own VMC certificate.

To keep the verified logo on your emails, use Tallyfy's default email settings.
