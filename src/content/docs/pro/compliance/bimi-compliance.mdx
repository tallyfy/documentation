title: Understanding BIMI compliance for Tallyfy emails
---

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Brand Indicators for Message Identification (BIMI) is an email standard. It lets companies show their official logo next to real emails in your inbox. This helps you quickly see which emails are really from Tallyfy and trust Tallyfy emails.

### How BIMI works

BIMI adds a visual check to email security. Here's a simple explanation:

<Steps>
1.  **Security Checks:**
    Tallyfy uses standard email security like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC behind the scenes. These checks help prove that emails claiming to be from `tallyfy.com` were actually sent by us.

2.  **Strict Rules (DMARC):**
    For BIMI to work, Tallyfy uses strict DMARC rules. These rules tell email services (like Gmail or Outlook) to mark emails as spam or block them if they fail security checks. This helps stop fake emails pretending to be Tallyfy.

3.  **Logo Pointer (BIMI Record):**
    Tallyfy has a special instruction set up (a BIMI DNS record). This instruction points email services to our official logo file.

4.  **Logo Certificate (VMC):**
    Tallyfy uses a Verified Mark Certificate (VMC). It's like a digital badge proving we own the logo and have the right to use it in emails. A trusted company provides this.

5.  **Showing the Logo:**
    When your email service gets an email from `tallyfy.com`, it first runs security checks (SPF, DKIM, DMARC). If the email passes and our strict DMARC rules are met, the service looks up the logo pointer (BIMI record) and checks the logo certificate (VMC). If correct, it shows the Tallyfy logo next to our email in your inbox.
</Steps>

### Benefits for Tallyfy users

Because Tallyfy uses BIMI, you get:

*   **More Trust and Security:** Seeing the verified Tallyfy logo helps you trust emails are really from us. This makes it easier to spot fake emails (phishing) that don't have the logo.
*   **Easy Identification:** Quickly find official Tallyfy emails in your inbox by looking for our logo.
*   **Better Brand Recognition:** Seeing our logo regularly helps you recognize Tallyfy.

### Security threats avoided by BIMI and DMARC

The security checks (DMARC) BIMI uses help stop email scams:

*   **Fake Emails (Spoofing):** Scammers sending emails that look like they're from `tallyfy.com` will fail security checks. Their emails won't show the Tallyfy logo, making fakes easier to spot. For example, a fake password reset email won't have our logo.
*   **Tricking You (Phishing):** Phishing emails trying to trick you into giving away passwords or info are less likely to succeed if they can't show the trusted Tallyfy logo. A fake 'Update Your Account' email without the logo is a clear warning sign.
*   **Pretending to Be Tallyfy (Brand Impersonation):** BIMI makes it harder for criminals to impersonate Tallyfy in email campaigns, protecting Tallyfy's reputation.

### Important note on custom SMTP settings

:::caution[Using custom SMTP disables BIMI benefits]
If you set up Tallyfy to send emails via your **own email server (Custom SMTP)** instead of Tallyfy's servers (`tallyfy.com`), the BIMI logo **will not appear** on those emails.

This happens because the emails come from *your* system, not from Tallyfy. Tallyfy's security rules and logo certificate (BIMI/VMC) are not used. Whether a logo appears depends on *your* email system setup (your SPF, DKIM, DMARC, and possibly your own BIMI setup).
:::

To get the security benefits of the Tallyfy logo appearing via BIMI, use the default Tallyfy email settings.
