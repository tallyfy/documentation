title: Understanding BIMI compliance for Tallyfy emails

Brand Indicators for Message Identification (BIMI) represents an advanced email authentication security protocol. This verified email logo standard enables organizations to display authenticated brand indicators alongside legitimate messages in recipient inboxes. The email deliverability enhancement helps you instantly recognize and trust authentic communications from Tallyfy<sup>®</sup>.

### How does BIMI authentication work?

BIMI strengthens sender authentication protocols through visual verification mechanisms. This brand trust verification system operates through coordinated security layers:

<Steps>
1.  **Security Checks:**
    Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> implements comprehensive email authentication security including SPF, DKIM, and DMARC protocols. These verification systems confirm that messages originating from `tallyfy.com` undergo legitimate sender authentication.

2.  **Strict Rules (DMARC):**
    For verified email logos to appear, Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> enforces stringent DMARC policies. These inbox security verification standards instruct email providers to quarantine or reject messages failing authentication protocols. This approach effectively prevents fraudulent communications impersonating our brand.

3.  **Logo Pointer (BIMI Record):**
    Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> maintains specialized DNS configuration (BIMI record) that directs email platforms to our authenticated brand indicator file.

4.  **Logo Certificate (VMC):**
    Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> employs a Verified Mark Certificate (VMC) - essentially a cryptographic credential validating our legitimate ownership and authorized usage of brand assets in email communications. Accredited certificate authorities issue these digital attestations.

5.  **Showing the Logo:**
    When email providers receive communications from `tallyfy.com`, they execute sender authentication protocols (SPF, DKIM, DMARC verification). Upon successful authentication and DMARC policy compliance, the system retrieves our brand indicator via BIMI record and validates the VMC certificate. Following verification completion, the authentic Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> logo displays adjacent to our message.
</Steps>

### What user security benefits does BIMI provide?

Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> BIMI implementation delivers measurable inbox security verification benefits:

*   **Enhanced Trust and Security:** The authenticated brand indicator provides visual confirmation of legitimate Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> communications. This verified email logo system simplifies identification of fraudulent messages lacking proper authentication credentials.
*   **Streamlined Recognition:** Instantly locate official Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> messages through distinctive brand indicator presence in your email interface.
*   **Reinforced Brand Familiarity:** Consistent exposure to our authenticated logo strengthens Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> brand recognition and trustworthiness.

### How does BIMI provide cyber threat protection?

These email authentication security measures effectively neutralize sophisticated cyber attacks:

*   **Domain Spoofing Prevention:** Malicious actors attempting to impersonate `tallyfy.com` encounter authentication barriers. Their communications lack verified email logo credentials, creating obvious visual differentiation. Fraudulent password reset attempts remain conspicuously unmarked.
*   **Phishing Attack Mitigation:** Social engineering campaigns lose effectiveness without authenticated brand indicators. Deceptive 'account update' messages lacking Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> verification remain conspicuously suspicious to recipients.
*   **Brand Impersonation Resistance:** These sender authentication protocols significantly complicate unauthorized brand usage attempts, safeguarding Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> reputation integrity. According to [industry research](https://bimigroup.org/), BIMI reduces phishing success rates by up to 42%.

### What should I know about custom SMTP settings?

:::caution[Using custom SMTP disables BIMI benefits]
When you configure Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> to send emails via your **own email server (Custom SMTP)** instead of Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> servers (`tallyfy.com`), the BIMI logo **will not appear** on those emails.

This occurs because messages originate from *your* infrastructure rather than Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> systems. Our email authentication security protocols and verified certificates become inapplicable. Brand indicator display depends entirely on *your* sender authentication protocols configuration.

To leverage verified email logo security advantages through BIMI, maintain default Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> email authentication settings.
