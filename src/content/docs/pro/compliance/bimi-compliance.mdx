title: Understanding BIMI compliance for Tallyfy emails

Brand Indicators for Message Identification (BIMI) is an email standard. It lets companies like Tallyfy show their official logo next to real emails in your inbox. This helps you quickly see which emails are truly from Tallyfy and trust our messages.

### How BIMI works

BIMI adds a visual check on top of existing email security checks. Here's a simple explanation:

<Steps>
1.  **Security Checks:**
    Tallyfy uses standard email security checks like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC behind the scenes. These checks help prove that emails saying they are from `tallyfy.com` were actually sent by us.

2.  **Strict Rules (DMARC):**
    For BIMI to work, Tallyfy uses strict DMARC rules. These rules tell email services (like Gmail or Outlook) to put emails in spam or block them if they fail the security checks. This helps stop fake emails pretending to be from Tallyfy.

3.  **Logo Pointer (BIMI Record):**
    Tallyfy has a special instruction set up online (a BIMI DNS record). This instruction tells email services where to find our official logo file.

4.  **Logo Certificate (VMC):**
    Tallyfy uses a Verified Mark Certificate (VMC). Think of it like a digital badge that proves we own the Tallyfy logo and have the right to use it in emails. A trusted company issues this badge.

5.  **Showing the Logo:**
    When your email service gets an email from `tallyfy.com`, it first runs the standard security checks (SPF, DKIM, DMARC). If the email passes these checks and our strict DMARC rules are being followed, the service looks up our logo pointer (BIMI record). It then checks our logo certificate (VMC). If everything is correct, it shows the official Tallyfy logo next to our email in your inbox.
</Steps>

### Benefits for Tallyfy users

Because Tallyfy uses BIMI, you get:

*   **More Trust and Security:** Seeing the verified Tallyfy logo helps you trust that an email is really from us. This makes it easier to spot fake emails (phishing or spoofing) that don't have the logo.
*   **Easy Identification:** Find official Tallyfy emails quickly in your busy inbox by looking for our logo.
*   **Better Brand Recognition:** Seeing our logo regularly helps you recognize the Tallyfy brand.

### Security threats avoided by BIMI and DMARC

The security checks (DMARC) that BIMI uses help stop several types of email scams:

*   **Fake Emails (Spoofing):** Scammers trying to send emails that look like they're from `tallyfy.com` will fail the security checks. Their emails won't show the Tallyfy logo, making the fake easier to spot. For example, a fake password reset email wouldn't have our logo.
*   **Tricking You (Phishing):** Emails trying to trick you into giving away passwords or personal information are less likely to work if they can't show the trusted Tallyfy logo. A fake "Update Your Account" email without the logo is a big warning sign.
*   **Pretending to Be Tallyfy (Brand Impersonation):** BIMI makes it much harder for criminals to pretend to be Tallyfy in harmful email campaigns, protecting our reputation.

### Important note on custom SMTP settings

:::caution[Using Custom SMTP Disables BIMI Benefits]
If you set up Tallyfy to send emails using your **own email server (Custom SMTP)** instead of Tallyfy's default email servers (`tallyfy.com`), the BIMI logo **will not appear** on those emails.

This happens because the emails are sent from *your* system, not directly from Tallyfy. Tallyfy's security rules and logo certificate (BIMI/VMC) aren't used. Whether a logo appears depends entirely on how *your own* email system is set up (your SPF, DKIM, DMARC, and possibly your own BIMI configuration).
:::

To get the trust and security benefits of Tallyfy's logo showing up via BIMI, keep the default Tallyfy email settings.
