HSTS forces your browser to use encrypted connections only. It blocks any attempt to connect to Tallyfy without HTTPS - even if someone tricks you into clicking an `http://` link, your browser upgrades it automatically.

### How does HSTS work?

When you first visit Tallyfy over **HTTPS**, your browser receives a `Strict-Transport-Security` header. This tells the browser: "Always use encryption with Tallyfy - no exceptions."

Your browser remembers this for one year[^3]. Even if you type `http://` instead of `https://`, the browser catches it before sending any data.

### How does Tallyfy use HSTS preloading?

Tallyfy is on the **HSTS preload list[^1]** - hardcoded into Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and other major browsers. Your browser already knows to use HTTPS with Tallyfy **before you even visit for the first time**. There's no window of vulnerability. Not even for a millisecond.

### What attacks does HSTS prevent?

*   **SSL stripping[^2]:** Attackers try to downgrade your connection to plain HTTP. HSTS blocks this - your browser upgrades to HTTPS before any data leaves your device.
*   **Man-in-the-middle exploits:** Someone sitting between you and Tallyfy, pretending to be us? Your browser won't accept anything but a verified, encrypted connection.
*   **Session hijacking:** Login cookies and authentication tokens only travel over encrypted channels. No exceptions. This matters most on public Wi-Fi, where attackers commonly try to intercept traffic.
*   **Eavesdropping:** Every click, form submission, and document you view is encrypted. Network admins, ISPs, and nearby devices can't see what you're doing in Tallyfy.

### What are HSTS requirements?

Tallyfy meets all seven requirements for proper HSTS:

1.  **Valid TLS/SSL certificate** - proves you're connecting to the real Tallyfy, not an imposter.
2.  **Automatic HTTPS redirection** - any HTTP request gets redirected to HTTPS instantly, so you receive the HSTS header through a secure connection.
3.  **All resources over HTTPS** - every image, script, and resource loads over HTTPS. No mixed content.
4.  **Secure header delivery** - the HSTS header is only sent over HTTPS. Sending it over HTTP would let attackers modify it.
5.  **One-year minimum max-age** - browsers remember the HSTS policy for at least a year, so you're protected even after months away.
6.  **All subdomains covered** - whether you're on app.tallyfy.com or go.tallyfy.com, HSTS applies everywhere. The `includeSubDomains` directive covers them all.
7.  **Preload list inclusion** - Tallyfy is hardcoded into browsers, so new users get protection before their first visit.
