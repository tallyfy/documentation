title: How Tallyfy uses HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
---

HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a web security rule that Tallyfy uses to protect your data. It makes sure the connection between your web browser and Tallyfy is always secure. This article explains what HSTS is, how it helps you, and what security problems it prevents.

### What is HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)?

HSTS is a security rule that websites use. It tells web browsers (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari) that they must *only* talk to the website using a secure **HTTPS** connection. It's like Tallyfy telling your browser, "Always use a secret code when you talk to me."

When you visit Tallyfy using a secure HTTPS connection for the first time, our website sends a special message back to your browser (called the `Strict-Transport-Security` header). This message tells your browser to only use HTTPS for all future visits to Tallyfy for a long time (usually about two years).

### How Tallyfy uses HSTS

Tallyfy uses HSTS everywhere on our platform. More importantly, Tallyfy is included in the **HSTS preload lists** built into major web browsers.

Being on this list means your browser knows it *must* use a secure HTTPS connection for Tallyfy **even before you visit us for the first time**. This closes a small security loophole that could exist otherwise, giving you better security right from the start.

### Benefits of HSTS for Tallyfy customers

Tallyfy using HSTS gives you several security benefits:

*   **Protection Against Eavesdropping Attacks:** HSTS helps stop attackers from forcing your browser to switch from a secure HTTPS connection to an insecure HTTP one (this is called an **SSL stripping** attack). This often happens if you accidentally type `http://tallyfy.com` or click an old link. HSTS tells your browser to switch to HTTPS *before* sending any information, blocking this attack.
*   **Secure Cookies:** Information stored in your browser's cookies (like login information) could be stolen if sent over an insecure HTTP connection. HSTS makes sure that important cookies are never sent insecurely, protecting your account, especially on public Wi-Fi.
*   **Privacy:** By forcing all communication to be encrypted (scrambled), HSTS keeps your activity on Tallyfy private and safe from spying.
*   **Confidence:** Knowing Tallyfy uses security rules like HSTS shows we take protecting your data seriously.

### Security threats prevented by HSTS

HSTS helps stop these security problems:

*   **SSL Stripping:** As mentioned, HSTS stops attackers from tricking your browser into using insecure HTTP instead of secure HTTPS.
*   **Protocol Downgrade Attacks:** It prevents any tricks that try to force your browser to use the less secure HTTP connection.
*   **Cookie Theft:** It stops attackers from stealing your login information (session cookies) when you use insecure networks by ensuring cookies are only sent over secure HTTPS.

#### Real-life example: Public Wi-Fi

Imagine using Tallyfy on public Wi-Fi (like at a coffee shop). A hacker on the same network could try an SSL stripping attack. If you typed `http://tallyfy.com`, the hacker could try to stop your browser from switching to the secure HTTPS version. They could then potentially see your login details or other data. Because Tallyfy uses HSTS and is preloaded, your browser *automatically* switches to HTTPS *on your computer* before sending anything, stopping the hacker.

### HSTS requirements and why they exist

For HSTS (especially the preloading feature) to work safely, websites need to meet certain rules:

1.  **Have a Valid Security Certificate (TLS/SSL):** This is the basis of HTTPS. It proves the website is really Tallyfy and allows secure, scrambled communication. *Why? Ensures you're connected to the real Tallyfy, not a fake site.*
2.  **Send HTTP Visitors to HTTPS:** Anyone trying to visit the `http://` address must be automatically sent to the `https://` address. *Why? Guides everyone to the secure version and makes sure the HSTS rule is delivered securely.*
3.  **Serve Everything Over HTTPS:** The entire website, including all images, scripts, and styles, must work securely over HTTPS. *Why? Prevents security warnings and ensures your whole experience is safe.*
4.  **Send the HSTS Rule Only Over HTTPS:** The `Strict-Transport-Security` message must only be sent over a secure HTTPS connection. *Why? Messages sent over insecure HTTP can be changed or removed by attackers.*
5.  **Set a Long Time Limit (`max-age`):** The rule needs to tell browsers to use HTTPS for a long time (at least one year for preloading). *Why? Keeps your connection secure even if you don't visit Tallyfy for a while.*
6.  **Include Subdomains (for Preload):** The rule must apply to all parts of the Tallyfy website (like `app.tallyfy.com`). *Why? Protects the entire Tallyfy service.*
7.  **Include the `preload` Marker (for Preload):** This signals that Tallyfy agrees to be included in the browser's built-in HSTS list. *Why? This is needed to get the extra security of being preloaded.*

These rules make sure that once your browser learns the HSTS rule for Tallyfy, it can reliably force secure connections, protecting you from common attacks.
