HSTS forces your browser to use encrypted connections only - it's Tallyfy's way of saying "no unencrypted data allowed here." Think of it as a security bouncer that blocks any attempt to connect without proper encryption. Once your browser talks to Tallyfy, we tell it: "From now on, always use HTTPS with us, even if someone tries to trick you into using regular HTTP."

### How do transport layer security protocols work?

Here's what happens behind the scenes. When you first visit Tallyfy over **HTTPS**, we send your browser a special instruction called the `Strict-Transport-Security` header. It's like giving your browser a permanent note that says "Always use encryption when talking to Tallyfy - no exceptions!"

Your browser remembers this instruction for a really long time (we set it for two years[^3]). Even if you accidentally type `http://` instead of `https://`, your browser catches this mistake before sending any data. Smart, right?

### What is Tallyfy's HSTS implementation strategy?

We've taken HSTS a step further. Tallyfy is on something called the **HSTS preload list[^1]** - basically, we're hardcoded into Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and other major browsers. What does this mean for you?

Your browser already knows to use HTTPS with Tallyfy **before you even visit us for the first time**. There's no window of vulnerability, not even for a millisecond. You're protected from day one. That's serious security.

### What security advantages does HSTS provide for users?

Let's talk about what this actually protects you from. You might be thinking "Why all this fuss about HTTPS?" Here's why it matters:

*   **No more eavesdropping:** Remember those movie scenes where hackers intercept data? HSTS stops a nasty trick called **SSL stripping[^2]** where attackers try to downgrade your secure connection. If you accidentally click an old `http://` link to Tallyfy, your browser automatically upgrades it to HTTPS before sending anything. No data leaves your computer unencrypted.
*   **Your login stays safe:** All those session cookies that keep you logged in? They're transmitted only over encrypted connections. This matters big time when you're on public Wi-Fi at a coffee shop. Nobody can steal your session and pretend to be you.
*   **Everything stays private:** Every click, every form submission, every document you view - it's all encrypted. Period. Network admins, ISPs, or that person at the next table can't see what you're doing in Tallyfy.
*   **Peace of mind:** When you see that padlock icon, you know we're following the same security standards as your bank. It's not just marketing speak - it's real protection.

### How does HSTS mitigate cyber attacks?

Here's how HSTS blocks the bad guys:

*   **SSL Stripping Attacks:** You know when hackers try to force your connection back to plain HTTP? Can't happen. HSTS locks you into encrypted mode before any data leaves your device.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Exploits:** Those sophisticated attacks where someone sits between you and Tallyfy, pretending to be us? HSTS shuts them down cold. Your browser won't accept anything but our verified, encrypted connection.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Your authentication tokens and login cookies? They only travel over encrypted channels. No exceptions. Ever.

#### Real-life example: Public Wi-Fi

Picture this: You're at Starbucks, connecting to Tallyfy on their Wi-Fi. Someone else on that network is running hacking tools (happens more than you'd think). They try an SSL stripping attack - basically attempting to intercept your connection and force it to plain HTTP.

Here's the beautiful part: Even if you accidentally type `http://tallyfy.com`, your browser says "Nope!" It remembers our HSTS policy and upgrades to HTTPS before sending a single byte. The hacker gets nothing. You don't even know an attack was attempted. That's the power of HSTS preloading.

### What are HSTS requirements and why do they exist?

To make HSTS work properly, we follow seven strict rules. Here's what they are and why each one matters:

1.  **Valid TLS/SSL Certificate:** This proves we're actually Tallyfy, not some imposter. Think of it as our digital ID card that browsers verify before trusting us.
2.  **Automatic HTTPS Redirection:** If you somehow land on an HTTP page, we instantly redirect you to HTTPS. This ensures you get that protective HSTS header through a secure connection.
3.  **Everything Uses HTTPS:** Every image, script, and resource loads over HTTPS. No exceptions. Otherwise, you'd get those annoying "mixed content" warnings - and potential security holes.
4.  **Secure Header Delivery:** The HSTS instruction itself comes through HTTPS only. Why? Because if we sent it over plain HTTP, attackers could modify it. That would defeat the whole purpose.
5.  **Long Memory (One Year Minimum):** We tell browsers to remember our HSTS policy for at least a year. Even if you don't visit Tallyfy for months, you're still protected when you come back.
6.  **All Subdomains Protected:** Whether you're on app.tallyfy.com or api.tallyfy.com, HSTS covers everything. One policy, total protection.
7.  **Browser Preload List:** We've opted into the ultimate protection - being hardcoded into browsers themselves. New users get HSTS protection before they even know we exist.

These aren't just arbitrary rules. Each requirement closes a specific security gap. Together, they create an airtight system that keeps your data safe. According to [security research](https://www.upguard.com/blog/hsts), proper HSTS implementation reduces man-in-the-middle attack success rates by over 90%.
