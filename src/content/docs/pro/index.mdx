- **Task-centric workflows** rather than data-centric systems
- **Comprehensive coverage** from documentation to automation

## Getting started with Tallyfy

The basic workflow in Tallyfy follows these steps:

1. Create or import a template
2. Launch processes from your template
3. Track progress in real time
4. Improve your template based on insights

### 1. Create or upload a template

Templates are the foundation of Tallyfy. You can:

- Build a template from scratch
- Use Tallyfy AI to generate a template
- Import existing procedures

Templates come in two primary types:
- **Procedure templates**: Step-by-step processes with tasks
- **Document templates**: Forms with fields to complete

Here's an example of a customer onboarding template:

### 2. Launch processes from templates

Once your template is ready, you can launch specific instances called processes:

1. Select your template
2. Provide a descriptive name for the specific instance
3. Enter any required kick-off information
4. Assign participants
5. Launch the process

Use clear, specific names for your processes:
- Template: "Customer Onboarding" → Process: "Samsung Onboarding"
- Template: "Employee Onboarding" → Process: "Jane Doe - Sales Team"

### 3. Track process progress

Tallyfy automatically:
- Assigns tasks to the right people
- Sends email notifications
- Tracks completion status
- Manages follow-ups and handoffs

All participants can view process status in a visual interface:

Individual tasks provide detailed information and action buttons:

### 4. Continuously improve templates

Unlike ad-hoc projects, Tallyfy enables ongoing process refinement:
- Collect feedback through comments
- Analyze completion times and bottlenecks
- Incorporate corrections into templates
- Make permanent improvements to prevent recurring issues

## Best practices for template creation

### Procedure templates best practices

#### Start with a basic outline
Begin with core process steps and refine over time. Tallyfy AI can help generate initial templates:

![Create a template using Tallyfy AI](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-create-client-onboarding-template-from-tallyfyAI.png)

#### Write clear step descriptions
Start each step with an action verb and be specific about what needs to be done.
- Good: "Email estimate to customer for approval"
- Less clear: "Manage customer estimate"

#### Incorporate media resources
Add images and videos to clarify complex steps:

#### Use appropriate task types
Choose the right task type for each step (standard task, approval, email, etc.):

#### Assign clear accountability
Specify who is responsible for each task:

![Assign Task](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-assign-a-task-to-somebody.png)

#### Set logical deadlines
Define when tasks should be completed relative to process start or other tasks:

#### Implement automation rules
Use conditional logic to create dynamic processes that adapt to different scenarios:

#### Plan data collection
Use kick-off forms to gather necessary information before process launch:

### Document templates best practices

Tallyfy documents are dynamic forms designed for use within the platform, not for download.

#### Add fields to your document
Click **New Field** to add different field types:
- **Short text**: For names, titles, identifiers
- **Long text**: For descriptions, notes, details
- **Date**: For deadlines, milestones, effective dates

#### Reuse existing fields
Use the **Existing fields** option to add fields already defined elsewhere:
