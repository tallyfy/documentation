Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> is a workflow management platform designed for non-technical people. 

### What business problems does Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> solve?

* How can AI help create procedures quickly instead of writing for hours?
* How do you ensure people actually follow processes?
* How can tasks get done without constant reminders?
* How do you prevent tasks from being forgotten?
* How can you improve processes that nobody follows?
* How can AI automate tasks when everyone does them differently?
* How do you make sure work gets done the same way every time?

These are massive, under-rated problems that impact business efficiency significantly.

You can't use AI effectively without agreed processes that people **already** follow. Using AI without standardized processes is like trying to build a roof without a foundation!

### 1. Document - Store business process instructions

Keep all business procedures in one centralized location. People forget important details (the "Forgetting Curve"), so having everything centralized helps everyone execute tasks correctly.

However, if nobody reads your documentation - what's the point?

### 2. Track - Follow workflow progress in real-time

See who's doing what with automatic reminders and notifications. Using step-by-step guides helps people learn faster, reduces status update meetings, and ensures consistent, predictable work execution across your organization. 

### 3. Improve - Continuously optimize processes with AI

Use AI to improve and automate business processes. Bake improvements directly into templates without retraining team members.

> James Clear

You can't improve or automate steps that aren't documented **and** followed. Repeatable processes are far more valuable than projects because they're standardized, predictable, automatable, and improvable.

### How does Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> work?

- **Document** processes clearly using Workflow Made Easy<sup>®</sup>
- **Launch** standard workflows easily
- **Track** [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) progress live
- **[Automate](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/)** repetitive steps

### How can Tallyfy help with lots of small papercuts?

Many vital business processes lack dedicated software and are managed via email, chat or spreadsheets.

Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> empowers users to:

- Document processes as reusable [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)
- Launch and track workflows consistently
- Automate repetitive steps where possible

This self-service approach reduces wasted effort and brings complete visibility to **all** organizational workflows.

## What kinds of processes work best with Tallyfy?

Focus on processes currently managed manually where no dedicated app exists.

Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> excels for processes that:

-   **Need structured data**: Consistent information collection
-   **Are frequent**: Occur often enough to benefit from digitization
-   **Require standardization**: Must be done the same way for quality/compliance
-   **Need to scale**: Establish correctly now to handle higher volumes later
-   **Are complex**: Many steps or conditional rules hard to remember
-   **Require audit trails**: Proof of who completed what
-   **Need tracking**: Visibility for workers, managers, leaders, or customers
-   **Must be predictable**: Everyone knows what happened and what's next

### What are the key benefits?

- **Save time**: Reduce routine work
- **Control quality**: Maintain consistent standards
- **Show real-time status**: Track progress live
- **Automate handovers**: Smooth task transitions
- **Improve continuously**: Use data and feedback

### What makes Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> unique?

- **Repeatable processes**, not one-off projects
- **Simple conditional logic** ("if-this-then-that")
- **Workflows centered on tasks**
- **Integrated documentation with automation**

## How can I get started with Tallyfy?

Start with Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> in phases:

<Steps>
1.  **Document and centralize.** Create [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) using AI or import existing documents. Centralize your SOPs.
2.  **Launch and track.** Launch templates as active [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). Track completion and introduce [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/).
3.  **Automate and improve.** Add [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/). Use [analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/) to refine templates.
</Steps>

### 1. Create or upload a template

[Templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) are central to Tallyfy:

- Build from scratch
- Use AI to generate drafts
- Import existing procedures

Two main types:
- **[Procedure templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)**: Step-by-step processes (e.g., employee onboarding)
- **[Document templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/)**: Standardized documents with fillable [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) (e.g., policies)

Example customer onboarding template:

![Tallyfy customer onboarding workflow template showing step-by-step process structure](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-show-template-example.png)

### 2. Launch processes from templates

Launch specific instances called [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/):

<Steps>
1. Choose your template
2. Name descriptively (e.g., "Onboarding for Samsung")
3. Enter kick-off information
4. Assign people
5. Launch
</Steps>

### 3. Track progress

Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> automatically:
- Assigns [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/)
- Sends email updates
- Tracks completion
- Manages handoffs

Process status view:

Task detail view:

### 4. Continuously improve templates

- Collect feedback via comments
- Monitor task durations
- Update templates easily
- Make lasting improvements

## What are best practices for template creation?

### How do I create effective procedures?

#### Start with a basic outline
List main steps, add details later. Use AI for initial drafts:

![Create a template using Tallyfy® AI](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-create-client-onboarding-template-from-tallyfyAI.png)

#### Write clear step descriptions
Begin with action verbs:
- Good: "Email the estimate to the customer"
- Avoid: "Customer estimate handling"

#### Add helpful media
Include images/videos for complex instructions:

![Insert Media](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-add-media-to-tasks.png)

#### Use the right task types
Select appropriate types (Task, Approve/Reject, Email Draft):

![Approval Tasks](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-switch-to-approvereject.png)

#### Assign clear responsibility

![Assign Task](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-assign-a-task-to-somebody.png)

#### Set realistic deadlines

![Specify Deadline](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-specify-deadline-to-task.png)

#### Use automation rules
Apply conditional logic:

![Automation Rules](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-click-automations.png)

#### Plan data collection
Use [kick-off forms](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/):

![Kick-off Form](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-how-to-add-kickoff-forms.png)

### How do I create effective documents?

[Document templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) create forms for platform use.

#### Add fields
Click **New Field** for various [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/):

![Add new field](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-add-field-document.png)

#### Reuse existing fields
Ensure consistency:
