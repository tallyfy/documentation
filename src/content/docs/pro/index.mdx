## Welcome to Tallyfy Pro

Tallyfy is a workflow automation platform. It helps you reduce routine work, see the status of tasks in real time, and maintain consistent quality through repeatable [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).

### Platform overview

Tallyfy helps you:

- **Document** your processes clearly.
- **Launch** standard workflows easily.
- **Track** [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) progress live.
- **[Automate](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/)** repetitive steps using rules.

### Handling smaller, specific processes

Many important business processes aren't large or company-wide. They are the common, specific workflows for particular teams or tasks, which often don't have dedicated software.

Currently, you might manage these using emails, spreadsheets, documents, or chats. They might seem too specific or small for busy IT teams to build solutions for.

Tallyfy allows business users to manage these processes directly. You can:

- Quickly document specific processes as reusable [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).
- Launch and track them consistently, adding structure to work that was previously disorganized.
- Automate steps where possible to save time.

This self-service approach, supported by IT when needed, reduces wasted effort and the risk of teams using unapproved tools ("shadow IT"). Tallyfy brings visibility and standards to these vital, everyday workflows.

### Key benefits

Tallyfy helps organizations by:

- **Saving time**: Reduce routine administrative work.
- **Controlling quality**: Maintain consistent standards for all processes.
- **Showing real-time status**: See who is assigned what and track progress live.
- **Automating handovers**: Pass tasks between people smoothly.
- **Improving continuously**: Make processes better using data and feedback.

### Tallyfy's unique approach

Compared to other tools, Tallyfy focuses on:

- **Repeatable processes**, not just one-off projects.
- **Simple conditional logic** ("if this, then that"), not complex flowcharts.
- **Workflows centered on tasks**, not just data storage.
- **Integrating documentation with automation**.

## Getting started with Tallyfy

The basic steps in Tallyfy involve:

<Steps>
1. Create or import a template
2. [Launch processes](/products/pro/launching/) from your template
3. Track progress in real time
4. Improve your template based on feedback and data
</Steps>

### Recommended way to start

For the best results, consider starting in phases:

<Steps>
1.  Document and centralize.** First, focus on documenting your main processes as Tallyfy [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). Use AI features or upload existing documents to speed this up. Keep all your standard operating procedures (SOPs) in one place.
2.  Launch and track.** Once key templates are ready, start [launching](/products/pro/launching/) them as active [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). Begin tracking completion and introduce your team to completing [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in Tallyfy.
3.  Automate and improve.** Explore [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) to make workflows even smoother. Use feedback options and [analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/) data (if available) to continuously improve your templates.
</Steps>

Starting with documentation provides a solid foundation before introducing tracking and automation to your team. This phased approach can make the transition smoother.

### 1. Create or upload a template

[Templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) are central to Tallyfy. You can:

- Build a template from scratch.
- Use Tallyfy AI to generate a template draft.
- Import procedures you already have documented.

There are two main types of templates:
- **[Procedure templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)**: Define step-by-step processes containing tasks.
- **[Document templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/)**: Create forms with [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to be filled in.

Here's an example of a customer onboarding template:

![Customer Onboarding Template Example](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-show-template-example.png)

### 2. Launch processes from templates

After creating a template, you launch specific instances called [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/):

<Steps>
1. Choose your template.
2. Give the specific process instance a clear, descriptive name.
3. Enter any required information to start (this is the kick-off information).
4. Assign relevant people to the process.
5. Launch the process.
</Steps>

Use clear and specific names for your processes to easily identify them:
- Template: "Customer Onboarding" → Process: "Onboarding for Samsung"
- Template: "Employee Onboarding" → Process: "Jane Doe - Sales Team Onboarding"

### 3. Track process progress

Tallyfy automatically handles several tracking aspects:
- Assigns [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to the correct people based on the template.
- Sends relevant email updates.
- Tracks task completion status.
- Manages follow-ups and task handoffs between steps.

All participants can view the process status visually:

Individual tasks show detailed information and action buttons:

### 4. Continuously improve templates

Tallyfy is designed for improving repeatable processes over time:
- Collect feedback through comments within tasks and processes.
- Monitor how long tasks take to identify bottlenecks or delays.
- Update templates easily with improvements or corrections.
- Make lasting improvements to standard procedures, avoiding repeated mistakes.

## Best practices for template creation

Follow these tips when building your [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).

### Procedure template best practices

#### Start with a basic outline
Begin by listing the main steps of the process. You can add details and refine later. Tallyfy AI can help create an initial draft:

![Create a template using Tallyfy AI](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-create-client-onboarding-template-from-tallyfyAI.png)

#### Write clear step descriptions
Start each step description with an action verb (e.g., **Send**, **Review**, **Upload**). Clearly state the required action.
- Good: "Email the estimate to the customer for approval."
- Less clear: "Customer estimate handling."

#### Add helpful media
Include images and videos in step descriptions to clarify complex instructions:

![Insert Media](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-add-media-to-tasks.png)

#### Use the right task types
Select the appropriate type for each step (Task, Approve/Reject, Expiring Step, Email Draft, or Auto-Send Email) based on its function:

![Approval Tasks](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-switch-to-approvereject.png)

#### Assign clear responsibility
Specify exactly who needs to complete each task:

![Assign Task](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-assign-a-task-to-somebody.png)

#### Set realistic deadlines
Define when tasks are due, based either on when the process starts or when previous tasks are completed:

![Specify Deadline](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-specify-deadline-to-task.png)

#### Use automation rules
Apply conditional logic ("if this, then that" rules) to make processes adapt to different situations automatically:

![Automation Rules](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-click-automations.png)

#### Plan how to collect data
Use [kick-off forms](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/) to gather necessary information before a process begins:

![Kick-off Form](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-how-to-add-kickoff-forms.png)

### Document template best practices

Tallyfy [document templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) create forms used within the platform. They are not primarily designed for downloading.

#### Add fields to your document
Click **New Field** to add various types of [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/):
- **Short text**: For names, titles, IDs.
- **Long text**: For descriptions, notes, details.
- **Date**: For deadlines, milestones, effective dates.
- *And many other types.*

![Add new field](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-add-field-document.png)

#### Reuse existing fields
Use the **Existing fields** option to add fields you've already defined in other templates or forms, ensuring consistency:
