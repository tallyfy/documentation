Tallyfy turns your business processes into self-driving workflows in minutes - without coding or flowcharts. It's built for non-technical people.

Whether you're dealing with small papercuts or big inefficient processes - hundreds of organizations save 2 hours per employee daily with Tallyfy.

Simple workflow is a basic human right. Tallyfy makes AI useful and practical for your everyday processes.

### Problems Tallyfy solves

* **Start quick** - AI creates or imports processes in minutes.
* **Run it - don't read it** - Remove the burden of reading and remembering everything. Everyone follows the latest process.
* **Prevent mistakes** - Stop tasks from being forgotten or done inconsistently. Nothing falls through the cracks.
* **Track it** - Track any process in real-time. No more manual status updates and meetings.
* **Improve it** - Improve your process easily. Automate certain tasks.
* **Delegate** - Auto-delegate to people, automation, or AI. Scale operations and grow margins while improving quality.

People forget 90% of their training within a week. It's called the [forgetting curve](/products/pro/tutorials/why-documentation-training-fails-forgetting-curve/)[^1] - but Tallyfy embeds guidance directly into tasks. These workflow failures can cost your organization 20% - 40% of **all work time**. That's an invisible, massive waste.

You can't delegate tasks to AI without agreed processes that people already follow. Without standardized processes, AI becomes guesswork. Tallyfy provides the foundation for AI to deliver practical benefits.

### 1. Document

Tallyfy centralizes all business procedures where they're actually used - inside active workflows. Capture every task, how to do it, who's doing it, and by when.

### 2. Track

Instantly turn what you documented into a running workflow. Track who's doing what in real-time - no more busywork asking "what's the status?". Trackable workflows cut status meetings by 80% while making sure work gets done right every time. Your clients can be assigned work and see progress too.

### 3. Improve

Delegate selected tasks to automations, scripts, or AI. Compound the value of improvements in your repeatable processes over time. You can't improve or automate chaos. Tallyfy makes processes visible, measurable, and 40% faster on average.

### How to succeed with any process

- **Document** your process in minutes (like a recipe)
- **Launch** workflows with one click - processes run themselves
- **Track** [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) progress and capture data (clients love this). Tallyfy handles reminders automatically.
- **[Automate](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/)** rules with "if this then that"
- **Improve** quickly by delegating certain tasks to AI, scripts, or middleware.

### Daily workflow benefits

80% of business processes live in email, chat, and spreadsheets.

Tallyfy lets anyone:

- Transform processes into reusable [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in 10 minutes
- Launch client-facing workflows that impress
- Eliminate 90% of follow-up emails


## Best-fit processes


Tallyfy works best for workflows that:

-   **Need structured data**: Consistent information collection
-   **Are frequent**: Occur often enough to benefit from digitization
-   **Require standardization**: Must be done the same way 
-   **Need to scale**: Establish correctly now to handle higher volumes later
-   **Are complex**: Many steps or conditional rules hard to remember
-   **Require audit trails**: Proof of who completed what
-   **Need tracking**: Visibility for workers, managers, leaders, or customers
-   **Must be predictable**: Everyone knows what happened and what's next

### Key benefits

- **Save 2 hours daily** - Eliminate status updates and follow-ups
- **100% consistency** - Every process follows your best practice
- **Client transparency** - Share real-time progress externally
- **Zero dropped balls** - Automatic handoffs don't fail
- **40% faster processes** - Data-driven improvements compound

### Unique features

- **Client-facing workflows** that make money, not just save money
- **[Knowledge-only mode](/products/pro/tutorials/knowledge-only-mode/)** - Publish procedures as searchable reference guides without tracking. Perfect for how-to documentation and SOPs that teams need to read but don't formally complete
- **[Conditional logic automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/conditional-visibility-guide/)** - IF-THEN rules that show or hide tasks based on form inputs, creating adaptive workflows that change based on user selections[^2]
- **No-code automation** anyone can set up in 3 clicks - conditional branching, auto-assignments, and deadline actions
- **Self-driving processes** that run themselves with automatic routing
- **Works in minutes** - not months of implementation

## Getting started

Get your first workflow running in under 10 minutes:

<Steps>
1.  **Document and centralize.** Create [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) using AI or import existing documents. Centralize your SOPs.
2.  **Launch and track.** Launch templates as active [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). Track completion and assign [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/).
3.  **Automate and improve.** Add [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/). Use [analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/) to refine your templates.
</Steps>

:::tip[New user onboarding]
**First time using Tallyfy?** The system automatically launches an onboarding process with sample tasks to complete. The first task asks you to mark it complete - just click the **Complete** button in that task. If the **Start Process** button appears grayed out, complete the onboarding tasks first. This helps you understand the basics before launching your own processes.

### 1. Create a template

[Templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) are your workflow blueprints in Tallyfy:

- Create with AI in 60 seconds
- Import existing SOPs instantly
- Start from proven examples

Two types cover everything:
- **[Procedure templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)** - Multi-step workflows (onboarding drops from 5 days to 5 hours)[^3]
- **[Document templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/)** - Smart forms with automatic [routing](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/)[^4]


![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-show-template-example.png)

### 2. Launch processes

Launch live workflows called [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) - it's that simple:

<Steps>
1. Pick your template
2. Name it clearly ("Samsung Onboarding - Q4 2024")
3. Fill quick kick-off form
4. Tallyfy auto-assigns the right people
5. Click launch - done!
</Steps>

### 3. Track progress

Tallyfy runs workflows on autopilot:

## Template creation best practices

### Creating effective procedures

#### Start simple
Outline main steps first. Tallyfy's AI fills in the details in seconds:

![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-create-client-onboarding-template-from-tallyfyAI.png)

#### Make steps clear
Start each step with an action verb:
- Good: "Email the estimate to the customer within 24 hours"
- Vague: "Handle customer communications"

#### Add helpful media
Include images or videos for complex instructions:

![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-add-media-to-tasks.png)

#### Use the right task types
Select appropriate types (Task, Approve/Reject, Email Draft):

![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-switch-to-approvereject.png)

#### Assign clear responsibility

![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-assign-a-task-to-somebody.png)

#### Set realistic deadlines

![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-specify-deadline-to-task.png)

#### Use automation rules
Apply conditional logic:

![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-click-automations.png)

#### Plan data collection
Use [kick-off forms](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/):

![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-how-to-add-kickoff-forms.png)

### Creating effective documents

[Document templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) let you create forms for use across the platform.

#### Add fields
Click **New Field** for various [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/):

![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-add-field-document.png)

#### Reuse existing fields
Ensure consistency:

## Comparison to traditional tools

### Document tools

Word, Google Docs, wikis, and Notion create static documentation. Here's how Tallyfy's active workflows compare:

| Static Documentation | Tallyfy Active Workflows |
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Reads like a manual | Runs like software |
| People must remember to check | Notifications bring work to people |
| No accountability tracking | See exactly who did what, when |
| Manual status updates | Real-time progress visibility |
| Copy-paste for each use | Launch once, runs automatically |
| Hope people follow it | Enforces the process |
| Separate tools for forms | Forms built into workflow |
| Email chains for approvals | Approvals happen in-context |

Key differences:
- Launch as live processes - not PDFs nobody reads
- Tasks happen inside the workflow with assignments and deadlines
- [Snippets](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/) eliminate copy-paste[^5]
- Auto-[translates](/products/pro/miscellaneous/how-can-i-translate-content-in-tallyfy/) to 25+ languages[^6]
- Updates flow to all active processes
- See who actually follows procedures
- Collect data through forms at each step
- Automate handoffs and routing decisions

### Spreadsheets

Key differences:
- Workflows that run themselves (not manual tracking)
- One source of truth - no more "v2_final_FINAL.xlsx"
- Guests see only their tasks
- If-this-then-that automation built in
- Clients love the real-time visibility

## Next steps

Create your first [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) - it takes 10 minutes and can save 10 hours weekly.

import { CardGrid, LinkTitleCard } from "~/components";
import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

[^1]: Based on Hermann Ebbinghaus's research - without reinforcement, people forget 50% of new information within an hour, 70% within 24 hours, and 90% within a week. Tallyfy solves this by embedding training directly into the workflow.

[^2]: Unlike traditional workflow tools that need IT departments for setup, Tallyfy's automation rules can be configured by any business user in a few clicks using simple if-then logic.

[^3]: This time reduction comes from eliminating manual handoffs, automatic task assignment based on availability, and parallel task execution where sequential processing isn't required.

[^4]: Document routing uses conditional logic to send forms to the right approvers based on field values - for example, purchase orders over $10,000 go to senior management while smaller amounts route to department heads.

[^5]: Snippets are reusable text blocks that update everywhere when changed once. Updating a compliance disclaimer in one place automatically updates it across all documents and active processes.

[^6]: Powered by Azure Cognitive Services, this auto-translates task instructions, forms, and process documentation into the user's preferred language while maintaining context and technical accuracy.
