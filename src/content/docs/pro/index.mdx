Tallyfy turns your business processes into self-driving workflows in under 10 minutes - no coding, no flowcharts, no IT needed. Join 500+ companies who save 2 hours daily per person by making workflow automation a basic human right.

### Problems Tallyfy solves

* AI creates procedures in minutes instead of hours
* Ensures people follow processes consistently
* Prevents forgotten or inconsistent tasks
* Enables process improvement and automation through standardization

These workflow failures cost companies 20% of their productivity - that's one full day per week.

You can't use AI effectively without agreed processes that people **already** follow. Without standardized workflows, AI suggestions become guesswork - Tallyfy provides the foundation AI needs to deliver real results.

### 1. Document - Capture the process

Tallyfy centralizes all business procedures where they're actually used - inside active workflows. People forget 90% of training within a week (the [forgetting curve](/products/pro/tutorials/why-documentation-training-fails-forgetting-curve/)), but Tallyfy embeds guidance directly into tasks.


### 2. Track - Follow progress in real-time

Track who's doing what in real-time - no more "what's the status?" emails. Tallyfy's step-by-step workflows cut status meetings by 80% while ensuring work gets done right every time. Your clients see progress too. 

### 3. Improve - Automate processes with AI

Tallyfy's AI analyzes your actual workflow data to suggest improvements - not theoretical best practices. Build enhancements directly into templates. Team members see updates instantly.

Here's the key: You can't improve or automate chaos. Tallyfy makes processes visible, measurable, and 40% faster on average. Repeatable workflows compound value over time.

### Core workflow

- **Document** processes in minutes with AI assistance (Workflow Made Easy)
- **Launch** workflows with one click - they run themselves
- **Track** [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) progress live (clients love this)
- **[Automate](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/)** repetitive steps - save 2 hours daily

### Daily workflow benefits

80% of business processes live in email, chat, and spreadsheets.

Tallyfy empowers anyone to:

- Transform processes into reusable [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in 10 minutes
- Launch client-facing workflows that impress
- Eliminate 90% of follow-up emails


## Best-fit processes


Tallyfy excels for workflows that:

-   **Need structured data**: Consistent information collection
-   **Are frequent**: Occur often enough to benefit from digitization
-   **Require standardization**: Must be done the same way for quality/compliance
-   **Need to scale**: Establish correctly now to handle higher volumes later
-   **Are complex**: Many steps or conditional rules hard to remember
-   **Require audit trails**: Proof of who completed what
-   **Need tracking**: Visibility for workers, managers, leaders, or customers
-   **Must be predictable**: Everyone knows what happened and what's next

### Key benefits

- **Save 2 hours daily**: Eliminate status updates and follow-ups
- **100% consistency**: Every process follows your best practice
- **Client transparency**: Share real-time progress externally
- **Zero dropped balls**: Automatic handoffs never fail
- **40% faster processes**: Data-driven improvements compound

### Unique features

- **Client-facing workflows** that make money, not just save money
- **No-code automation** anyone can set up in 3 clicks
- **Self-driving processes** - they run themselves
- **Works in minutes**, not months of implementation

## Getting started

Get your first workflow running in under 10 minutes:

<Steps>
1.  **Document and centralize.** Create [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) using AI or import existing documents. Centralize your SOPs.
2.  **Launch and track.** Launch templates as active [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). Track completion and introduce [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/).
3.  **Automate and improve.** Add [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/). Use [analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/) to refine templates.
</Steps>

### 1. Create or upload a template

[Templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) are your workflow blueprints in Tallyfy:

- Create with AI in 60 seconds
- Import existing SOPs instantly
- Start from proven examples

Two types that cover everything:
- **[Procedure templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)**: Multi-step workflows (onboarding takes 5 days â†’ 5 hours)
- **[Document templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/)**: Smart forms with automatic [routing](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/)

### 2. Launch processes from templates

Launch live workflows called [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) - it's this simple:

<Steps>
1. Pick your template
2. Name it clearly ("Samsung Onboarding - Q4 2024")
3. Fill quick kick-off form
4. Tallyfy auto-assigns the right people
5. Click launch - done!
</Steps>

### 3. Track progress

Tallyfy runs workflows on autopilot:
- Smart-assigns [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) based on workload
- Sends updates only when needed (not spam)
- Shows live progress to everyone
- Never drops handoffs - guaranteed

## Template creation best practices

### Creating effective procedures

#### Start simple
Outline main steps first. Tallyfy's AI writes the details in seconds:

![Create a template using Tallyfy AI](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-create-client-onboarding-template-from-tallyfyAI.png)

#### Make steps clear
Start with action verbs:
- Perfect: "Email the estimate to the customer within 24 hours"
- Vague: "Handle customer communications"

#### Add helpful media
Include images/videos for complex instructions:

![Insert Media](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-add-media-to-tasks.png)

#### Use the right task types
Select appropriate types (Task, Approve/Reject, Email Draft):

![Approval Tasks](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-switch-to-approvereject.png)

#### Assign clear responsibility

![Assign Task](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-assign-a-task-to-somebody.png)

#### Set realistic deadlines

![Specify Deadline](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-specify-deadline-to-task.png)

#### Use automation rules
Apply conditional logic:

![Automation Rules](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-click-automations.png)

#### Plan data collection
Use [kick-off forms](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/):

![Kick-off Form](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-how-to-add-kickoff-forms.png)

### Creating effective documents

[Document templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) create forms for platform use.

#### Add fields
Click **New Field** for various [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/):

![Add new field](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-add-field-document.png)

#### Reuse existing fields
Ensure consistency:

## Comparison to traditional tools

### Document tools (Word, Google Docs, wikis)

Key differences:
- Launch as live processes - not PDFs nobody reads
- Tasks happen inside the workflow
- [Snippets](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/) eliminate copy-paste
- Auto-[translates](/products/pro/miscellaneous/how-can-i-translate-content-in-tallyfy/) to 25+ languages
- Updates flow to all active processes
- See who actually follows procedures

### Spreadsheets

Key differences:
- Workflows that run themselves (not manual tracking)
- One source of truth - no "v2_final_FINAL.xlsx"
- Guests see only their tasks
- If-this-then-that automation built in
- Clients love the real-time visibility

## Next steps

Create your first [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) - it takes 10 minutes and saves 10 hours weekly.
