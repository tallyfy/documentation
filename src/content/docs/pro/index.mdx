## Tallyfy is Workflow Made Easy<sup>®</sup>

Tallyfy is workflow software that empowers organizations to eliminate administrative work through automated status updates and reporting. It provides real-time visibility into the status of any task or process.

### Key Benefits

* **Save Time** – Eliminate administrative work by approximately 2 hours per person daily
* **Start Quickly** – Document processes with AI assistance
* **Track Status** – Monitor task assignments and progress in real-time
* **Delegate & Scale** – Assign to team members or automation systems
* **Prevent Errors** – Maintain quality and consistency standards
* **Transform Culture** – Convert unstructured processes into defined workflows
* **Automate Handovers** – Transfer tasks between people automatically
* **Automate Reminders** – Send notifications to appropriate stakeholders
* **Automate Rules** – Configure conditional logic to trigger time-saving automations

Tallyfy is designed for users without technical or process expertise, with key differentiators:

* Focus on repeatable processes rather than one-time projects
* Comprehensive workflow coverage – document, run, track, and automate
* Intuitive conditional logic instead of complex flowcharts
* Task-centric rather than data-centric approach

Tallyfy specializes in process management, not project management. Processes are scalable, repeatable, improvable, and predictable – projects are not.

## Create or Upload a Template

To run a process, first create a template. Build from scratch or use Tallyfy AI to generate one. Templates can be procedures or documents. Here's a customer onboarding template example:

![Customer Onboarding](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-show-template-example.png)

## Launch and Track Processes

After creating a template, launch a process from it – similar to making a copy of a master document and using it for a specific instance.

Tallyfy automatically assigns tasks, emails participants, and manages follow-ups and hand-offs.

A process is a unique instance of using a template for a specific purpose. Use descriptive names for processes:

* Template: "Customer Onboarding" → Process: "Samsung Onboarding"
* Template: "Employee Onboarding" → Process: "Jane Doe - Sales Team"
* Template: "Financial Spend Approval" → Process: "Purchase 18 widgets for warehouse"

Track process status visually:

All participants can track individual tasks and view completion status.

## Improve Continuously

Templates can be continuously improved through feedback and collaborative refinement. Team members can add comments on templates to suggest enhancements.

Incorporate corrections for mistakes into your templates to prevent recurrence. Unlike ad-hoc projects and tasks, templates enable incremental, permanent improvements.

## Template Types

* **Procedure** – A step-by-step process
* **Document** – A form with fields to complete

## Best Practices for Procedures

### Create a Basic Outline

Design your initial template with core elements. Start using it and improve gradually. Tallyfy AI can provide ideas for steps and templates if needed.

### Refine Each Step

Make steps clear and specific with precise action verbs at the beginning. "Email estimate to customer for approval" is more precise than "Manage customer estimate."

### Create Important Steps First

Focus on primary actions that require tracking. Not every minor step needs to be included if it's common knowledge.

### Incorporate Media Resources

Enhance step descriptions with images and videos via the **Insert** button. This captures critical knowledge about how tasks are performed for future delegation.

### Plan Data Requirements

Collect necessary information using a "Kick off form." For example, employee onboarding requires first name, last name, team, and other details before the process can begin.

### Use Task Types Appropriately

Tasks have types beyond the default "Task." Set types like approvals or emails to specify the action required.

### Assign Accountability

Assign each step to a person, job title, or group. If the exact person is unknown, specify the appropriate job title.

### Set Appropriate Deadlines

Each step can have relative due dates, calculated from process launch or after completion of other steps.

### Implement Automation

Automations use conditional logic to hide/show tasks, adjust deadlines, or assign people automatically. They replace complex flowcharts with functionality that flowcharts cannot provide.

## Best Practices for Documents

Tallyfy documents are designed for use, not download. Launch a document template to use it.

Customize templates by marking editable fields in the **Builder** section. Set default content within editable fields to allow users to either accept defaults or customize allowed fields.

This approach reduces document clutter by eliminating multiple copies of the same document stored in different locations.

### Add Fields to Your Document

Click **New Field** to add field types:
* **Short text** – For client names, project names, etc.
* **Long text** – For descriptions or notes
* **Date** – For deadlines or current date

![Add new field](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-add-field-document.png)

### Use Existing Fields 

Click **Existing fields** and drag desired fields into your document. This is ideal for information entered once but used multiple times throughout a template, such as a name that appears in several places in a legal contract.
