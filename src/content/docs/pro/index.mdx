## Tallyfy is Workflow Made Easy<sup>®</sup>

Workflow chaos ends **here** and **now**.

Tallyfy is workflow software that empowers you to eliminate busywork of meetings, manual status updates, and reporting. 

It provides real-time answers to "What is the status?" for any task or process.

Benefits include:

* **Save Time** – Eliminate 2 hours of administrative work per person each day.
* **Start Quickly** – Document processes with AI assistance.
* **Track Status** – Monitor who's doing what in real-time.
* **Delegate & Scale** – Assign to people or automations.
* **Prevent Errors** – Maintain quality and consistency.
* **Transform Culture** – Convert chaos into confidence.
* **Automate Handovers** – Move tasks between people automatically.
* **Automate Reminders** – Send timely notifications to everyone.
* **Automate Rules** – Set if-this-then-that conditions to run time-saving automations.

Tallyfy is designed for users without technical or process expertise. Key points:

* Focuses on repeatable processes, not projects
* Covers the complete workflow spectrum – document, run, track, and automate
* Replaces complex flowcharts with intuitive if-this-then-that automations
* Moves tasks between people rather than data between apps

Tallyfy specializes in process management, not project management. Processes are scalable, repeatable, improvable, and predictable – projects are not.

## Create or upload a template

To run a process, first create a template. Build from scratch or use Tallyfy AI to upload one. Templates can be procedures or documents. Here's a customer onboarding template example:

![Customer Onboarding](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-show-template-example.png)

## Launch and track processes

After creating a template, launch a new process from it – similar to making a copy of a recipe and using it.

Tallyfy automatically assigns tasks, emails participants, and manages follow-ups and hand-offs.

A process is a unique instance of using a template for a specific employee, customer, approval, or other purpose. Use descriptive names for processes:

* Template: "Customer Onboarding" → Process: "Samsung Onboarding"
* Template: "Employee Onboarding" → Process: "Jane Doe - Sales Team"
* Template: "Financial Spend Approval" → Process: "Purchase 18 widgets for warehouse"

Track process status visually:

All participants can track individual tasks and see completion status.

## Improve continuously

Templates can be continuously improved through feedback and brainstorming sessions. Team members can add comments on templates.

Incorporate fixes for mistakes into your templates to prevent recurrence. Unlike ad-hoc projects and tasks, templates enable compound, incremental, permanent improvements.

## Two types of templates

* **Procedure** – A step-by-step process
* **Document** – A form with fields to complete

## Tips for procedures

:::note[Create a basic outline]
Design your initial template but don't overanalyze details. Start using it and improve gradually. Tallyfy AI can provide creative ideas for steps and templates if you need inspiration.

![Template created](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-click-create-template-by-tallyfyai.png)

:::note[Refine each step]
Make steps clear and specific with precise action verbs at the beginning. "Email estimate to customer for approval" is more precise than "Manage customer estimate."
:::

:::note[Create important steps first]
Focus on primary actions that require tracking. Not every minor step needs to be included if it's common knowledge.
:::

:::note[Incorporate images and videos]
Enhance step descriptions with media via the **Insert** button. This captures critical knowledge about how tasks are performed for future delegation.
:::

![Insert Media](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-add-media-to-tasks.png)

:::note[Think about data needed before launch]
Collect necessary information using a "Kick off form." For example, employee onboarding requires first name, last name, team, and other details before the process can begin.
:::

![Kick-off Form](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-how-to-add-kickoff-forms.png)

:::note[Use task types to clarify intent]
Tasks have types beyond the default "Task." Set types like approvals or emails to specify the action required.
:::

![Approval Tasks](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-switch-to-approvereject.png)

:::note[Assign accountability]
Assign each step to a person, job title, or group. If the exact person is unknown, specify the appropriate job title.
:::

![Assign Task](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-assign-a-task-to-somebody.png)

:::note[Set deadlines when needed]
Each step can have relative due dates, calculated from process launch or after completion of other steps.
:::

![Specify Deadline](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-specify-deadline-to-task.png)

:::note[Discover automation capabilities]
Automations use simple "if this then that" rules to hide/show tasks, adjust deadlines, or assign people automatically. They replace complex flowcharts and offer functionality flowcharts cannot provide.

## Tips for documents

Tallyfy documents are designed for use, not download. Launch a document template to use it.

Customize templates by marking editable fields in the **Builder** section. Set default content within editable fields to allow users to either accept defaults or customize allowed fields.

This approach reduces document clutter by eliminating multiple copies of the same document stored in different locations.

### Add fields to your document

Click **New Field** to add field types:
* **Short text** – For client names, project names, etc.
* **Long text** – For descriptions or notes
* **Date** – For deadlines or current date

![Add new field](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-add-field-document.png)

### Use existing fields 

Click **Existing fields** and drag desired fields into your document. This is ideal for information entered once but used multiple times throughout a template, such as a name that appears in several places in a legal contract.

![Select existing field](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-select-existing-field-document.png)
