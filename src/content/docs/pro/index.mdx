Tallyfy turns your business processes into self-driving workflows in minutes - without coding or flowcharts. It's designed for non-technical people. 

Whether you have lots of papercuts or big inefficient processes - hundreds of organizations are saving 2 hours (per employee) daily with Tallyfy. 

Simple workflow is a basic human right. Tallyfy is here to make AI useful and practical for your everyday processes.

### Problems Tallyfy solves

* **Start quick** - AI creates or imports processes in minutes.
* **Run it - don't read it** - Remove the burden of reading and remembering everything. Everyone follows the latest process.
* **Prevent mistakes** - Prevent tasks being forgotten or inconsistently completed. Ensure nothing falls through the cracks again.
* **Track it** - Ensure any process can be tracked in real-time. No need for manual status updates and meetings anymore.
* **Improve it** - Easily improve your process. Automate certain tasks.
* **Delegate** - Auto-delegate to people, automation or AI. Scale your operations and grow margins while improving quality.

Did you know that people forget 90% of their training within a week? It's called the [forgetting curve](/products/pro/tutorials/why-documentation-training-fails-forgetting-curve/))[^1] but Tallyfy embeds guidance directly into tasks. These workflow failures and problems can cost your organization around 20% - 40% of **all work time**. It's an invisible and massive waste.

You can't delegate tasks to AI without agreed processes that people already follow. Without standardized processes, using AI becomes guesswork. Tallyfy provides the critical foundation for AI to deliver practical benefits.

### 1. Document - Capture the process

Tallyfy centralizes all business procedures where they're actually used - inside active workflows. Capture every task, how to do it, who is doing it and by when. 

### 2. Track - Follow progress in real-time

Instantly turn what you documented into a running workflow. Track who's doing what in real-time - no more busywork asking "what's the status?". Trackable workflows cut status meetings by 80% while ensuring work gets done right every time. Your clients can be assigned work and see progress too. 

### 3. Improve - Automate processes with AI

Delegate selected task to automations, scripts or AI. Compound improvement and the value of gains in your repeatable processes over time. You can't improve or automate chaos. Tallyfy makes processes visible, measurable, and 40% faster on average. 

### How to succeed with any process

- **Document** your process in minutes (like a recipe)
- **Launch** workflows with one click - processes run themselves
- **Track** [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) progress and capture data (clients love this). Tallyfy also handles the chore of reminders.
- **[Automate](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/)** rules with "if this then that"
- **Improve** quickly by delegating certain tasks to AI, scripts or middleware.

### Daily workflow benefits

80% of business processes live in email, chat, and spreadsheets.

Tallyfy empowers anyone to:

- Transform processes into reusable [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in 10 minutes
- Launch client-facing workflows that impress
- Eliminate 90% of follow-up emails


## Best-fit processes


Tallyfy excels for workflows that:

-   **Need structured data**: Consistent information collection
-   **Are frequent**: Occur often enough to benefit from digitization
-   **Require standardization**: Must be done the same way 
-   **Need to scale**: Establish correctly now to handle higher volumes later
-   **Are complex**: Many steps or conditional rules hard to remember
-   **Require audit trails**: Proof of who completed what
-   **Need tracking**: Visibility for workers, managers, leaders, or customers
-   **Must be predictable**: Everyone knows what happened and what's next

### Key benefits

- **Save 2 hours daily**: Eliminate status updates and follow-ups
- **100% consistency**: Every process follows your best practice
- **Client transparency**: Share real-time progress externally
- **Zero dropped balls**: Automatic handoffs never fail
- **40% faster processes**: Data-driven improvements compound

### Unique features

- **Client-facing workflows** that make money, not just save money
- **[Knowledge-only mode](/products/pro/tutorials/knowledge-only-mode/)** - Publish procedures as searchable reference guides without tracking - perfect for how-to documentation and SOPs that teams need to read but not formally complete
- **[Conditional logic automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/conditional-visibility-guide/)** - Dynamic IF-THEN rules that show/hide tasks based on form inputs, creating adaptive workflows that change based on user selections[^2]
- **No-code automation** anyone can set up in 3 clicks - including conditional branching, auto-assignments, and deadline actions
- **Self-driving processes** - run themselves with automatic routing
- **Works in minutes** - not months of implementation

## Getting started

Get your first workflow running in under 10 minutes:

<Steps>
1.  **Document and centralize.** Create [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) using AI or import existing documents. Centralize your SOPs.
2.  **Launch and track.** Launch templates as active [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). Track completion and introduce [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/).
3.  **Automate and improve.** Add [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/). Use [analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/) to refine templates.
</Steps>

:::tip[New user onboarding]
**First time using Tallyfy?** The system automatically launches an onboarding process with sample tasks to complete. The first task asks you to mark it complete - simply click the **Complete** button in that task. If the **Start Process** button appears grayed out, complete the onboarding tasks first. This ensures you understand the basics before launching your own processes.

## Template creation best practices

### Creating effective procedures

#### Start simple
Outline main steps first. Tallyfy's AI writes the details in seconds:

![Create a template using Tallyfy AI](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-create-client-onboarding-template-from-tallyfyAI.png)

#### Make steps clear
Start with action verbs:
- Perfect: "Email the estimate to the customer within 24 hours"
- Vague: "Handle customer communications"

#### Add helpful media
Include images/videos for complex instructions:

![Insert Media](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-add-media-to-tasks.png)

#### Use the right task types
Select appropriate types (Task, Approve/Reject, Email Draft):

![Approval Tasks](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-switch-to-approvereject.png)

#### Assign clear responsibility

![Assign Task](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-assign-a-task-to-somebody.png)

#### Set realistic deadlines

![Specify Deadline](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-specify-deadline-to-task.png)

#### Use automation rules
Apply conditional logic:

![Automation Rules](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-click-automations.png)

#### Plan data collection
Use [kick-off forms](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/):

![Kick-off Form](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-how-to-add-kickoff-forms.png)

### Creating effective documents

[Document templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) create forms for platform use.

#### Add fields
Click **New Field** for various [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/):

![Add new field](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-add-field-document.png)

#### Reuse existing fields
Ensure consistency:

![Select existing field](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-select-existing-field-document.png)

## Comparison to traditional tools

### Document tools (Word, Google Docs, wikis, Notion)

**Static documentation** (wikis, SOPs, Notion) vs **Active workflows** (Tallyfy):

| Static Documentation | Tallyfy Active Workflows |
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Reads like a manual | Runs like software |
| People must remember to check | Notifications bring work to people |
| No accountability tracking | See exactly who did what, when |
| Manual status updates | Real-time progress visibility |
| Copy-paste for each use | Launch once, runs automatically |
| Hope people follow it | Enforces the process |
| Separate tools for forms | Forms built into workflow |
| Email chains for approvals | Approvals happen in-context |

Key differences:
- Launch as live processes - not PDFs nobody reads
- Tasks happen inside the workflow with assignments and deadlines
- [Snippets](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/) eliminate copy-paste[^5]
- Auto-[translates](/products/pro/miscellaneous/how-can-i-translate-content-in-tallyfy/) to 25+ languages[^6]
- Updates flow to all active processes
- See who actually follows procedures
- Collect data through forms at each step
- Automate handoffs and routing decisions

### Spreadsheets

Key differences:
- Workflows that run themselves (not manual tracking)
- One source of truth - no "v2_final_FINAL.xlsx"
- Guests see only their tasks
- If-this-then-that automation built in
- Clients love the real-time visibility

## Next steps

Create your first [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) - it takes 10 minutes and saves 10 hours weekly.

import PageTree from '@/components/PageTree.astro';
import { CardGrid, LinkTitleCard } from "~/components";
import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

[^1]: Based on Hermann Ebbinghaus's research, without reinforcement or application, people forget 50% of new information within an hour, 70% within 24 hours, and 90% within a week. Tallyfy solves this by embedding training directly into the workflow.

[^2]: Unlike traditional workflow tools that require IT departments to set up complex integrations, Tallyfy's automation rules can be configured by any business user in just a few clicks using simple if-then logic.

[^3]: This dramatic time reduction comes from eliminating manual handoffs, automatic task assignment based on availability, and parallel task execution where sequential processing isn't required.

[^4]: Document routing uses conditional logic to automatically send forms to the right approvers based on field values - for example, purchase orders over $10,000 go to senior management while smaller amounts route to department heads.

[^5]: Snippets are reusable text blocks that update everywhere when changed once. For instance, updating a compliance disclaimer in one place automatically updates it across hundreds of documents and active processes.

[^6]: Powered by Azure Cognitive Services, this feature auto-translates task instructions, forms, and process documentation into the user's preferred language, maintaining context and technical accuracy.
