Tallyfy turns your business processes into self-driving workflows in  minutes - without coding or flowcharts. Tallyfy frees IT from the burden of hand-holding everyone to drive practical benefits from workflow automation because it's designed for non-technical people. 

Whether you have lots of small papercuts or big inefficient processes - join hundreds of organizations saving 2 hours (per employee) daily on Tallyfy. We're growing organically because we take incredible care of you - our customer. 

Simple workflow is a basic human right. Every organization deserves the opportunity to gain practical benefits from foundational AI - not marketing hype and confusion. Tallyfy is here to make AI usable and real.

### Problems Tallyfy solves

* **Start quick** - AI creates or imports processes in minutes instead of hours. Eliminate the pain of capturing a process.
* **Run it - don't read it** - Ensure everyone follows the latest process consistently. Remove the burden of reading and remembering.
* **Eliminate mistakes** - Prevent forgotten or inconsistent tasks. Ensure nothing falls through the cracks.
* **Track it** - Ensure any process can be tracked in real-time. No need for status updates and meetings.
* **Improve it** - Easily and continuosly improve your process. Automate certain tasks.
* **Delegate** - Automatically delegate specific tasks to people, automation or AI. Scale operations without reducing quality.

Did you know that people forget 90% of their training within a week? It's called the [forgetting curve](/products/pro/tutorials/why-documentation-training-fails-forgetting-curve/))[^1], but Tallyfy embeds guidance directly into tasks. These workflow failures and problems can cost your organization around 20% - 40% of **all work time**. That's more than one full day a week. It's an invisible and massive waste.

You can't delegate tasks to AI without agreed processes that people **already** follow. Without standardized workflows, using AI becomes guesswork. Tallyfy provides the critical foundation for AI to deliver practical benefits.

### 1. Document - Capture the process

Tallyfy centralizes all business procedures where they're actually used - inside active workflows. 

### 2. Track - Follow progress in real-time

Track who's doing what in real-time - no more "what's the status?" emails. Tallyfy's step-by-step workflows cut status meetings by 80% while ensuring work gets done right every time. Your clients see progress too. 

### 3. Improve - Automate processes with AI

Tallyfy's AI analyzes your actual workflow data to suggest improvements - not theoretical best practices. Build enhancements directly into templates. Team members see updates instantly.

Here's the key: You can't improve or automate chaos. Tallyfy makes processes visible, measurable, and 40% faster on average. Repeatable workflows compound value over time.

### Core workflow

- **Document** processes in minutes with AI assistance (Workflow Made Easy)
- **Launch** workflows with one click - they run themselves
- **Track** [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) progress live (clients love this)
- **[Automate](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/)** repetitive steps - save 2 hours daily

## Best-fit processes


Tallyfy excels for workflows that:

-   **Need structured data**: Consistent information collection
-   **Are frequent**: Occur often enough to benefit from digitization
-   **Require standardization**: Must be done the same way for quality/compliance
-   **Need to scale**: Establish correctly now to handle higher volumes later
-   **Are complex**: Many steps or conditional rules hard to remember
-   **Require audit trails**: Proof of who completed what
-   **Need tracking**: Visibility for workers, managers, leaders, or customers
-   **Must be predictable**: Everyone knows what happened and what's next

### Key benefits

- **Save 2 hours daily**: Eliminate status updates and follow-ups
- **100% consistency**: Every process follows your best practice
- **Client transparency**: Share real-time progress externally
- **Zero dropped balls**: Automatic handoffs never fail
- **40% faster processes**: Data-driven improvements compound

## Getting started

Get your first workflow running in under 10 minutes:

<Steps>
1.  **Document and centralize.** Create [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) using AI or import existing documents. Centralize your SOPs.
2.  **Launch and track.** Launch templates as active [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). Track completion and introduce [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/).
3.  **Automate and improve.** Add [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/). Use [analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/) to refine templates.
</Steps>

:::tip[New user onboarding]
**First time using Tallyfy?** The system automatically launches an onboarding process with sample tasks to complete. The first task asks you to mark it complete - simply click the **Complete** button in that task. If the **Start Process** button appears grayed out, complete the onboarding tasks first. This ensures you understand the basics before launching your own processes.

## Template creation best practices

### Creating effective procedures

#### Start simple
Outline main steps first. Tallyfy's AI writes the details in seconds:

![Create a template using Tallyfy AI](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-create-client-onboarding-template-from-tallyfyAI.png)

#### Make steps clear
Start with action verbs:
- Perfect: "Email the estimate to the customer within 24 hours"
- Vague: "Handle customer communications"

#### Add helpful media
Include images/videos for complex instructions:

![Insert Media](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-add-media-to-tasks.png)

#### Use the right task types
Select appropriate types (Task, Approve/Reject, Email Draft):

![Approval Tasks](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-switch-to-approvereject.png)

#### Assign clear responsibility

![Assign Task](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-assign-a-task-to-somebody.png)

#### Set realistic deadlines

![Specify Deadline](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-specify-deadline-to-task.png)

#### Use automation rules
Apply conditional logic:

![Automation Rules](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-click-automations.png)

#### Plan data collection
Use [kick-off forms](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/):

![Kick-off Form](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-how-to-add-kickoff-forms.png)

### Creating effective documents

[Document templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) create forms for platform use.

#### Add fields
Click **New Field** for various [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/):

![Add new field](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-add-field-document.png)

#### Reuse existing fields
Ensure consistency:

![Select existing field](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-select-existing-field-document.png)

## Comparison to traditional tools

### Document tools (Word, Google Docs, wikis, Notion)

**Static documentation** (wikis, SOPs, Notion) vs **Active workflows** (Tallyfy):

| Static Documentation | Tallyfy Active Workflows |
|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Reads like a manual | Runs like software |
| People must remember to check | Notifications bring work to people |
| No accountability tracking | See exactly who did what, when |
| Manual status updates | Real-time progress visibility |
| Copy-paste for each use | Launch once, runs automatically |
| Hope people follow it | Enforces the process |
| Separate tools for forms | Forms built into workflow |
| Email chains for approvals | Approvals happen in-context |

Key differences:
- Launch as live processes - not PDFs nobody reads
- Tasks happen inside the workflow with assignments and deadlines
- [Snippets](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/) eliminate copy-paste[^5]
- Auto-[translates](/products/pro/miscellaneous/how-can-i-translate-content-in-tallyfy/) to 25+ languages[^6]
- Updates flow to all active processes
- See who actually follows procedures
- Collect data through forms at each step
- Automate handoffs and routing decisions

### Spreadsheets

Key differences:
- Workflows that run themselves (not manual tracking)
- One source of truth - no "v2_final_FINAL.xlsx"
- Guests see only their tasks
- If-this-then-that automation built in
- Clients love the real-time visibility

## Next steps

Create your first [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) - it takes 10 minutes and saves 10 hours weekly.

import PageTree from '@/components/PageTree.astro';
import { CardGrid, LinkTitleCard } from "~/components";
import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<PageTree />

[^1]: Based on Hermann Ebbinghaus's research, without reinforcement or application, people forget 50% of new information within an hour, 70% within 24 hours, and 90% within a week. Tallyfy solves this by embedding training directly into the workflow.

[^2]: Unlike traditional workflow tools that require IT departments to set up complex integrations, Tallyfy's automation rules can be configured by any business user in just a few clicks using simple if-then logic.

[^3]: This dramatic time reduction comes from eliminating manual handoffs, automatic task assignment based on availability, and parallel task execution where sequential processing isn't required.

[^4]: Document routing uses conditional logic to automatically send forms to the right approvers based on field values - for example, purchase orders over $10,000 go to senior management while smaller amounts route to department heads.

[^5]: Snippets are reusable text blocks that update everywhere when changed once. For instance, updating a compliance disclaimer in one place automatically updates it across hundreds of documents and active processes.

[^6]: Powered by Azure Cognitive Services, this feature auto-translates task instructions, forms, and process documentation into the user's preferred language, maintaining context and technical accuracy.
