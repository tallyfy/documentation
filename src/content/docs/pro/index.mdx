Tallyfy is a workflow platform designed for non-technical people. 

### Problems Tallyfy solves

* How can AI help create procedures quickly instead of writing for hours?
* How do you ensure people actually follow processes?
* How can tasks get done without constant reminders?
* How do you prevent tasks from being forgotten?
* How can you improve processes that nobody follows?
* How can AI automate tasks when everyone does them differently?
* How do you make sure work gets done the same way every time?

These are massive, under-rated problems. You can't use AI effectively without agreed processes that people **already** follow. It's like trying to build a roof without a foundation!

### 1. Document - Store instructions

Keep all procedures in one place. People forget things (the "Forgetting Curve"), so having everything centralized helps everyone do things right. But if nobody reads it - what's the point?

### 2. Track - Follow progress

See who's doing what with automatic reminders. Using guides helps people learn, cuts update meetings, and ensures consistent, predictable work. 

### 3. Improve - Keep getting better

Use AI to improve and automate processes. Bake in improvements without retraining.

You can't improve or automate steps that aren't documented **and** followed. Repeatable processes are far more valuable than projects because they're standardized, predictable, automatable, and improvable.

### What does Tallyfy do?

- **Document** processes clearly
- **Launch** standard workflows easily
- **Track** [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) progress live
- **[Automate](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/)** repetitive steps

### Have lots of small papercuts?

Many vital processes lack dedicated software and are managed via email, chat or spreadsheets. Tallyfy empowers business users to:

- Document them as reusable [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)
- Launch and track them consistently
- Automate steps where possible

This self-service approach reduces wasted effort and brings visibility to **all** workflows.

## What kinds of processes is it best for?

Focus on processes currently managed manually where no dedicated app exists.

Tallyfy excels for processes that:

-   **Need structured data**: Consistent information collection
-   **Are frequent**: Occur often enough to benefit from digitization
-   **Require standardization**: Must be done the same way for quality/compliance
-   **Need to scale**: Establish correctly now to handle higher volumes later
-   **Are complex**: Many steps or conditional rules hard to remember
-   **Require audit trails**: Proof of who completed what
-   **Need tracking**: Visibility for workers, managers, leaders, or customers
-   **Must be predictable**: Everyone knows what happened and what's next

### Key benefits

- **Save time**: Reduce routine work
- **Control quality**: Maintain consistent standards
- **Show real-time status**: Track progress live
- **Automate handovers**: Smooth task transitions
- **Improve continuously**: Use data and feedback

### Tallyfy's unique focus

- **Repeatable processes**, not one-off projects
- **Simple conditional logic** ("if-this-then-that")
- **Workflows centered on tasks**
- **Integrated documentation with automation**

## Getting started

Start with Tallyfy in phases:

<Steps>
1.  **Document and centralize.** Create [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) using AI or import existing documents. Centralize your SOPs.
2.  **Launch and track.** Launch templates as active [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). Track completion and introduce [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/).
3.  **Automate and improve.** Add [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/). Use [analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/) to refine templates.
</Steps>

### 1. Create or upload a template

[Templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) are central to Tallyfy:

- Build from scratch
- Use AI to generate drafts
- Import existing procedures

Two main types:
- **[Procedure templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)**: Step-by-step processes (e.g., employee onboarding)
- **[Document templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/)**: Standardized documents with fillable [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) (e.g., policies)

Example customer onboarding template:

### 2. Launch processes from templates

Launch specific instances called [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/):

<Steps>
1. Choose your template
2. Name descriptively (e.g., "Onboarding for Samsung")
3. Enter kick-off information
4. Assign people
5. Launch
</Steps>

### 3. Track progress

Tallyfy automatically:
- Assigns [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/)
- Sends email updates
- Tracks completion
- Manages handoffs

Process status view:

Task detail view:

### 4. Continuously improve templates

- Collect feedback via comments
- Monitor task durations
- Update templates easily
- Make lasting improvements

## Best practices for template creation

### Creating procedures

#### Start with a basic outline
List main steps, add details later. Use AI for initial drafts:

![Create a template using Tallyfy AI](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-create-client-onboarding-template-from-tallyfyAI.png)

#### Write clear step descriptions
Begin with action verbs:
- Good: "Email the estimate to the customer"
- Avoid: "Customer estimate handling"

#### Add helpful media
Include images/videos for complex instructions:

![Insert Media](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-add-media-to-tasks.png)

#### Use the right task types
Select appropriate types (Task, Approve/Reject, Email Draft):

![Approval Tasks](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-switch-to-approvereject.png)

#### Assign clear responsibility

![Assign Task](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-assign-a-task-to-somebody.png)

#### Set realistic deadlines

![Specify Deadline](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-specify-deadline-to-task.png)

#### Use automation rules
Apply conditional logic:

![Automation Rules](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-click-automations.png)

#### Plan data collection
Use [kick-off forms](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/):

![Kick-off Form](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-how-to-add-kickoff-forms.png)

### Creating documents

[Document templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) create forms for platform use.

#### Add fields
Click **New Field** for various [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/):

![Add new field](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-add-field-document.png)

#### Reuse existing fields
Ensure consistency:
