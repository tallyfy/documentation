## Welcome to Tallyfy Pro

Tallyfy is a workflow automation platform. It helps you reduce routine tasks, see the status of work in real time, and ensure consistent quality through repeatable [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).

### Platform overview

Tallyfy helps you:

- **Write down** your processes clearly.
- **Start** standard workflows easily.
- **See** [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) progress live.
- **[Automate](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/)** repeating tasks using rules.

### Handling smaller, specific processes

Many important business processes are not large or company-wide. They are the common, specific workflows for particular teams or tasks, which often lack dedicated software.

Currently, you might manage these using emails, spreadsheets, documents, or chat messages. They might seem too specialized or small for busy IT teams to create solutions for.

Tallyfy lets business users manage these processes directly. You can:

- Quickly document these specific processes as reusable [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).
- Start and track them consistently, adding structure to previously unorganized work.
- Automate steps where possible to save time.

This self-service approach, with IT support available, reduces wasted effort and the risk of teams using unapproved tools. Tallyfy brings visibility and standards to these important, everyday workflows.

### Key benefits

Tallyfy helps organizations by:

- **Saving time**: Reduce routine administrative work.
- **Controlling quality**: Keep standards consistent for all processes.
- **Showing real-time status**: See who is assigned what and track progress live.
- **Automating handovers**: Pass tasks between people smoothly.
- **Improving continuously**: Make processes better using data and feedback.

### Tallyfy's unique approach

Compared to other tools, Tallyfy focuses on:

- **Repeatable processes**, not one-off projects.
- **Simple conditional logic**, not complicated flowcharts.
- **Workflows centered on tasks**, not just data.
- **Integrating documentation with automation**.

## Getting started with Tallyfy

The basic steps in Tallyfy are:

<Steps>
1. Create or import a template
2. [Launch processes](/products/pro/launching/) from your template
3. Track progress in real time
4. Improve your template based on insights
</Steps>

### Recommended way to start

For the best results, follow these phases:

<Steps>
1.  **Phase 1: Document & Centralize.** First, focus on documenting your main processes as Tallyfy [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). You can use AI features or upload existing documents to make this faster. Keep all your standard operating procedures (SOPs) in one place.
2.  **Phase 2: Launch & Track.** Once your key templates are ready, start [launching](/products/pro/launching/) them as active [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). Begin tracking completion and introduce your team to completing tasks in Tallyfy.
3.  **Phase 3: Automate & Improve.** Look into [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) to make workflows even smoother. Use feedback options and [analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/) data (if available) to keep improving your templates.
</Steps>

Starting with documentation gives you a strong base before introducing tracking and automation to your team. This can make the change easier for everyone.

### 1. Create or upload a template

[Templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) are the core of Tallyfy. You can:

- Build a template from scratch.
- Use Tallyfy AI to create a template for you.
- Import procedures you already have.

There are two main types of templates:
- **[Procedure templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)**: Step-by-step processes containing tasks.
- **[Document templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/)**: Forms with [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) for you to fill in.

Here's an example of a customer onboarding template:

![Customer Onboarding Template Example](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-show-template-example.png)

### 2. Launch processes from templates

After creating a template, you can launch specific instances called processes:

<Steps>
1. Choose your template.
2. Give the specific process instance a clear name.
3. Enter any information needed to start (kick-off information).
4. Assign people to the process.
5. Launch the process.
</Steps>

Use clear and specific names for your processes:
- Template: "Customer Onboarding" → Process: "Onboarding for Samsung"
- Template: "Employee Onboarding" → Process: "Jane Doe - Sales Team Onboarding"

### 3. Track process progress

Tallyfy automatically:
- Gives [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to the correct people.
- Sends email updates.
- Tracks if tasks are complete.
- Manages follow-ups and task handoffs.

All participants can view process status in a visual interface:

Individual tasks provide detailed information and action buttons:

### 4. Continuously improve templates

Tallyfy helps you improve processes over time, unlike one-off projects:
- Get feedback through comments.
- Check how long tasks take and find delays.
- Update templates with corrections.
- Make lasting improvements to avoid repeating the same problems.

## Best practices for template creation

### Procedure template best practices

#### Start with a basic outline
Begin with the main steps of the process and add details later. Tallyfy AI can help create initial templates:

![Create a template using Tallyfy AI](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-create-client-onboarding-template-from-tallyfyAI.png)

#### Write clear step descriptions
Start each step description with an action verb (like **Send**, **Review**, **Upload**). Be specific about the action required.
- Good: "Email the estimate to the customer for approval."
- Less clear: "Manage customer estimate."

#### Add helpful media
Include images and videos to make complex steps easier to understand:

![Insert Media](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-add-media-to-tasks.png)

#### Use the right task types
Select the correct type for each step (Task, Approve/Reject, Expiring, Email Draft, or Email Auto-Send):

![Approval Tasks](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-switch-to-approvereject.png)

#### Assign clear responsibility
Clearly state who needs to complete each task:

![Assign Task](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-assign-a-task-to-somebody.png)

#### Set realistic deadlines
Define when tasks need to be done, based on when the process starts or when other tasks are finished:

![Specify Deadline](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-specify-deadline-to-task.png)

#### Use automation rules
Apply conditional logic ("if this, then that") to make processes flexible for different situations:

![Automation Rules](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-click-automations.png)

#### Plan how to collect data
Use [kick-off forms](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/) to gather needed information before a process starts:

![Kick-off Form](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-how-to-add-kickoff-forms.png)

### Document template best practices

Tallyfy documents are forms you use inside the platform. They are not meant to be downloaded.

#### Add fields to your document
Click **New Field** to add different types of fields:
- **Short text**: For names, titles, or IDs.
- **Long text**: For descriptions, notes, or details.
- **Date**: For deadlines, milestones, or effective dates.

![Add new field](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-add-field-document.png)

#### Reuse existing fields
Use the **Existing fields** option to add fields you have already defined elsewhere:
