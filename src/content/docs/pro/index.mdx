## Welcome to Tallyfy Pro

Tallyfy is a workflow automation platform that eliminates administrative work, provides real-time visibility into task status, and helps organizations maintain quality standards through repeatable [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).

### Platform overview

Tallyfy offers a platform that helps you:

- **Document** your processes clearly and consistently
- **Launch** standardized workflows at scale
- **Track** [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) progress and completion in real time
- **[Automate](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/)** repetitive work with rules and logic

### Handling the 'long tail' of processes

Many critical business processes aren't major, company-wide initiatives. They are the frequent, often niche workflows unique to specific teams or tasks – the 'long tail' of processes that often lack dedicated software solutions.

These might currently live scattered across emails, spreadsheets, documents, or chat messages. They can be too specialized or considered too small for overburdened IT teams to prioritize building custom solutions for.

Tallyfy allows business users to tackle this long tail directly. You can:

-   Quickly document these niche processes as reusable [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).
-   Launch and track them consistently, bringing structure to previously unstructured work.
-   Automate steps where possible, freeing up time.

This self-service approach, supported by IT when needed, reduces operational inefficiency and minimizes the risk of 'shadow IT' – where teams adopt unapproved tools out of necessity. Tallyfy brings visibility and standardization to these vital, everyday workflows.

### Key benefits

Tallyfy provides value to organizations through:

- **Time savings**: Reduce administrative work by approximately 2 hours per person daily
- **Quality control**: Maintain consistent standards across all processes
- **Real-time visibility**: Monitor task assignments and progress as it happens
- **Automated handovers**: Transfer tasks between people
- **Continuous improvement**: Refine processes based on data and feedback

### Tallyfy's unique approach

Unlike traditional tools, Tallyfy focuses on:

- **Repeatable processes** rather than one-time projects
- **Intuitive conditional logic** instead of flowcharts
- **Task-centric workflows** rather than data-centric systems
- **Comprehensive coverage** from documentation to automation

## Getting started with Tallyfy

The basic workflow in Tallyfy follows these steps:

1. Create or import a template
2. [Launch processes](/products/pro/launching/) from your template
3. Track progress in real time
4. Improve your template based on insights

### Recommended adoption approach

For effective adoption, we recommend a phased approach:

1.  **Phase 1: Document & Centralize.** Focus first on getting your core processes documented as Tallyfy [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). Use the AI features or upload existing documents to speed this up. Centralize your SOPs in one place.
2.  **Phase 2: Launch & Track.** Once key templates are built, begin [launching](/products/pro/launching/) them as active [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). Start tracking completion and introduce your team to completing tasks within Tallyfy.
3.  **Phase 3: Automate & Improve.** Explore [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) to further streamline workflows. Use the feedback mechanisms and [analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/) data (if enabled) to continuously refine your templates.

Starting with documentation ensures you have a solid foundation before introducing the tracking and automation aspects to your team, which can help with change management.

### 1. Create or upload a template

[Templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) are the foundation of Tallyfy. You can:

- Build a template from scratch
- Use Tallyfy AI to generate a template
- Import existing procedures

Templates come in two primary types:
- **[Procedure templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)**: Step-by-step processes with tasks
- **[Document templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/)**: Forms with [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to complete

Here's an example of a customer onboarding template:

![Customer Onboarding Template Example](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-show-template-example.png)

### 2. Launch processes from templates

Once your template is ready, you can launch specific instances called processes:

1. Select your template
2. Provide a descriptive name for the specific instance
3. Enter any required kick-off information
4. Assign participants
5. Launch the process

Use clear, specific names for your processes:
- Template: "Customer Onboarding" → Process: "Samsung Onboarding"
- Template: "Employee Onboarding" → Process: "Jane Doe - Sales Team"

### 3. Track process progress

Tallyfy automatically:
- Assigns [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to the right people
- Sends email notifications
- Tracks completion status
- Manages follow-ups and handoffs

All participants can view process status in a visual interface:

Individual tasks provide detailed information and action buttons:

### 4. Continuously improve templates

Unlike ad-hoc projects, Tallyfy enables ongoing process refinement:
- Collect feedback through comments
- Analyze completion times and bottlenecks
- Incorporate corrections into templates
- Make permanent improvements to prevent recurring issues

## Best practices for template creation

### Procedure templates best practices

#### Start with a basic outline
Begin with core process steps and refine over time. Tallyfy AI can help generate initial templates:

![Create a template using Tallyfy AI](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-create-client-onboarding-template-from-tallyfyAI.png)

#### Write clear step descriptions
Start each step with an action verb and be specific about what needs to be done.
- Good: "Email estimate to customer for approval"
- Less clear: "Manage customer estimate"

#### Incorporate media resources
Add images and videos to clarify complex steps:

![Insert Media](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-add-media-to-tasks.png)

#### Use appropriate task types
Choose the right task type for each step (Task, Approve/Reject, Expiring, Email Draft, or Email Auto-Send):

![Approval Tasks](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-switch-to-approvereject.png)

#### Assign clear accountability
Specify who is responsible for each task:

![Assign Task](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-assign-a-task-to-somebody.png)

#### Set logical deadlines
Define when tasks should be completed relative to process start or other tasks:

![Specify Deadline](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-specify-deadline-to-task.png)

#### Implement automation rules
Use conditional logic to create dynamic processes that adapt to different scenarios:

![Automation Rules](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-click-automations.png)

#### Plan data collection
Use [kick-off forms](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/) to gather necessary information before process launch:

![Kick-off Form](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-how-to-add-kickoff-forms.png)

### Document templates best practices

Tallyfy documents are dynamic forms designed for use within the platform, not for download.

#### Add fields to your document
Click **New Field** to add different field types:
- **Short text**: For names, titles, identifiers
- **Long text**: For descriptions, notes, details
- **Date**: For deadlines, milestones, effective dates

![Add new field](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-add-field-document.png)

#### Reuse existing fields
Use the **Existing fields** option to add fields already defined elsewhere:

![Select existing field](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-select-existing-field-document.png)
