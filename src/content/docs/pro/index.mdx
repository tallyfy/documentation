snippet: Tallyfy is a comprehensive workflow automation platform that helps businesses
  streamline operations through documenting tracking and improving processes while
  eliminating manual tasks and maintaining quality standards.
title: Introduction
---

Tallyfy is a workflow automation platform. It helps you reduce routine work, see the status of tasks in real time, and maintain consistent quality through repeatable [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).

### The three legs of the operations tripod

Three elements are critical for efficient, digitized operations, in this order:

1. **Documenting**: Establish a single source of truth for process knowledge to prevent disorganized chaos.
2. **Tracking**: Monitor who does what in real-time with automated reminders. This saves time otherwise spent on status updates and meetings, ensuring everyone follows the defined process.
3. **Improving**: Enable easy continuous improvement and automate steps with AI or scripts. This leads to increasingly efficient operations and builds a competitive advantage.

These needs aren't unique to Tallyfy; they're **common sense**. You can't improve a process that isn't documented or followed.

Tallyfy is the workflow automation app designed for non-technical people that addresses all three needs. We believe repeatable **processes** are more valuable than one-off projects because processes are standardized, predictable, automatable, and improvable. Projects lack these qualities, which is why project management tools often fail for process-driven work.

### Why workflow automation matters

Workflow automation eliminates time-wasting manual tasks and reduces errors. Without it, businesses often face inconsistent processes, poor visibility into work status, and challenges maintaining quality standards. Tallyfy provides a structured, transparent system for smooth work handoffs, consistent standards, and clear accountability. This frees teams to focus on higher-value activities while routine processes run efficiently.

### Platform overview

Tallyfy helps you:

- **Document** your processes clearly.
- **Launch** standard workflows easily.
- **Track** [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) progress live.
- **[Automate](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/)** repetitive steps using rules.

### Handling smaller, specific processes

Many vital business processes involve specific team or task workflows that lack dedicated software. You might manage these informally via email, spreadsheets, or chat, often because they seem too small for IT to prioritize.

Tallyfy allows business users to manage these processes directly. You can:

- Quickly document specific processes as reusable [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).
- Launch and track them consistently, adding structure to work that was previously disorganized.
- Automate steps where possible to save time.

This self-service approach, supported by IT when needed, reduces wasted effort and the risk of teams using unapproved tools ("shadow IT"). Tallyfy brings necessary visibility and standards to these everyday workflows.

### Key benefits

Tallyfy helps organizations by:

- **Saving time**: Reduce routine administrative work.
- **Controlling quality**: Maintain consistent standards for all processes.
- **Showing real-time status**: See who is assigned what and track progress live.
- **Automating handovers**: Pass tasks between people smoothly.
- **Improving continuously**: Make processes better using data and feedback.

### Tallyfy's unique approach

Compared to other tools, Tallyfy focuses on:

- **Repeatable processes**, not just one-off projects.
- **Simple conditional logic** ("if this, then that"), not complex flowcharts.
- **Workflows centered on tasks**, not just data storage.
- **Integrating documentation with automation**.

## Getting started with Tallyfy

The basic steps in Tallyfy involve:

<Steps>
1. Create or import a template
2. [Launch processes](/products/pro/launching/) from your template
3. Track progress in real time
4. Improve your template based on feedback and data
</Steps>

### Recommended way to start

For the best results, consider starting in phases:

<Steps>
1.  **Document and centralize.** Document your main processes as Tallyfy [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), using AI features or importing existing documents. Centralize your standard operating procedures (SOPs) here.
2.  **Launch and track.** Launch key templates as active [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). Track task completion and introduce your team to completing [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in Tallyfy.
3.  **Automate and improve.** Explore [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) to streamline workflows further. Use feedback and [analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/) data (if available) to continuously refine your templates.
</Steps>

Starting with documentation provides a solid foundation before introducing tracking and automation. This phased approach helps smooth the transition for your team.

### 1. Create or upload a template

[Templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) are central to Tallyfy. You can:

- Build a template from scratch.
- Use Tallyfy AI to generate a template draft.
- Import procedures you already have documented.

There are two main types of templates:
- **[Procedure templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)**: Define step-by-step processes containing tasks.
- **[Document templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/)**: Create forms with [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to be filled in.

Here's an example of a customer onboarding template:

![Customer Onboarding Template Example](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-show-template-example.png)

### 2. Launch processes from templates

After creating a template, you launch specific instances called [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/):

<Steps>
1. Choose your template.
2. Give the specific process instance a clear, descriptive name (e.g., "Onboarding for Samsung", not just "Customer Onboarding").
3. Enter any required kick-off information.
4. Assign relevant people.
5. Launch the process.
</Steps>

Using clear, specific names makes processes easy to identify later.

### 3. Track progress

Tallyfy automatically handles several tracking aspects:
- Assigns [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to the correct people based on the template.
- Sends relevant email updates.
- Tracks task completion status.
- Manages follow-ups and task handoffs between steps.

All participants can view the process status visually:

Individual tasks show detailed information and action buttons:

### 4. Continuously improve templates

Tallyfy facilitates improving repeatable processes over time:
- Collect feedback directly within tasks and processes using comments.
- Monitor task durations to identify bottlenecks.
- Easily update templates with improvements.
- Make lasting changes to standard procedures, preventing repeated mistakes.

## Best practices for template creation

Follow these tips when building your [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).

### Procedure template best practices

#### Start with a basic outline
Begin by listing the main steps of the process. You can add details and refine later. Tallyfy AI can help create an initial draft:

![Create a template using Tallyfy AI](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-create-client-onboarding-template-from-tallyfyAI.png)

#### Write clear step descriptions
Start each step description with an action verb (e.g., **Send**, **Review**, **Upload**) and state the required action clearly.
- Good: "Email the estimate to the customer for approval."
- Needs improvement: "Customer estimate handling."

#### Add helpful media
Include images and videos in step descriptions to clarify complex instructions:

![Insert Media](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-add-media-to-tasks.png)

#### Use the right task types
Select the appropriate type (Task, Approve/Reject, Expiring Step, Email Draft, Auto-Send Email) for each step based on its purpose:

![Approval Tasks](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-switch-to-approvereject.png)

#### Assign clear responsibility
Specify exactly who needs to complete each task:

![Assign Task](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-assign-a-task-to-somebody.png)

#### Set realistic deadlines
Define task due dates based on either the process start date or the completion of previous tasks:

![Specify Deadline](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-specify-deadline-to-task.png)

#### Use automation rules
Apply conditional logic ("if this, then that" rules) to make processes adapt to different situations automatically:

![Automation Rules](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-click-automations.png)

#### Plan how to collect data
Use [kick-off forms](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/) to gather necessary information *before* a process begins:

![Kick-off Form](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-how-to-add-kickoff-forms.png)

### Document template best practices

Tallyfy [document templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) create forms used within the platform. They are not primarily designed for downloading.

#### Add fields to your document
Click **New Field** to add different types of [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/), such as:
- **Short text**: For names, titles, IDs.
- **Long text**: For descriptions, notes.
- **Date**: For deadlines, milestones.
- *And many others.*

![Add new field](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-add-field-document.png)

#### Reuse existing fields
Use the **Existing fields** option to add fields you've already defined in other templates or forms, ensuring consistency:
