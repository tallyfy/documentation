## Tallyfy is Workflow Made Easy<sup>®</sup>

Workflow chaos ends **here** and **now**.

Tallyfy is workflow software re-imagined. It empowers you and your coworkers to eliminate the busywork of meetings, manual status updates via chats and meetings - and all that manual reporting. 

It gives you the answer to "What is the status?" for any given task or process in real-time.

These are the benefits:

* **Save Time** – Stop wasting 2 hours/person/day.
* **Start Quickly** – Document any process with AI.
* **Track Status** – See who’s doing what in real-time.
* **Delegate & Scale** – To people or automations.
* **Sleep Better** – Prevent errors and omissions.
* **Transform Culture** – Turn chaos into confidence.
* **Automate Handovers** - Tallyfy moves tasks between people.
* **Automate Reminders** - Everyone gets reminders.
* **Automate Rules** - Ditch the flowcharts. Set if-this-then-that conditions of various kinds and run time-saving automations.

Tallyfy is designed for everyone - especially people with no technical or process expertise. Here's a quick summary of what it does and doesn't do:

* **It focuses on repeatable processes** - not projects.
* **It covers the workflow spectrum** - when it comes to process, Tallyfy doesn't just let you document them. You can run, track and automate them as well.
* **It doesn't use flowcharts anywhere** - they are complex, out-dated and if-this-then-that automations can achieve a lot more than flowcharts _ever_ could.
* **It doesn't move data between apps** - it moves tasks between people. If you need integrations, middleware apps [may be more appropriate](https://tallyfy.com/products/pro/integrations/).

Tallyfy specializes in _process management_ - not project management. The difference is huge. Processes are scalable, repeatable, improvable and predictable. Projects are _none_ of those things.

## Create or upload a template

The first step to running a process is to create a template for it. You can build a template from scratch or use Tallyfy AI to upload one. Templates can be procedures or documents. Here's a screenshot of a template to onboard new customers the right way, every time:

![Customer Onboarding](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-show-template-example.png)

## Launch and track processes

Once you have a template - you can launch a new process from it. Think of it like making a cope of a recipe and running it.

Tallyfy automatically assigns tasks, emails people and manages  follow-ups and hand-offs. 

A process is a unique instance of you "using" a template for a _specific_ employee, customer, approval and so on. You can launch many processes from a template. You should use unique names for your process:

* If your template is "Customer Onboarding" - a process might be named "Samsung Onboarding"
* If your template is "Employee Onboarding" - a process might be named "Jane Doe - Sales Team"
* If your template is "Financial Spend Approval" - a process might be named "Purchase 18 widgets for warehouse"

You can track the status of your processes visually like this:

Everyone involved can track every task individually and see what's done and not done.

## Improve continuously

You don't have to keep improving your template - but it's a really good idea to do so via feedback or brainstorming sessions. People can add feedback on the template using simple comments. 

Make sure you improve your template with every mistake you make, so that the fix is baked in for next time and you don't make that mistake again. You can't get compound, incremental, permanent improvements easily with ad-hoc projects and ad-hoc tasks.

## Two types of templates

* A procedure - a step-by-step process
* A document - a document where you've set fields to fill in the blanks

## Tips for procedures

:::note[Create a basic outline]

Design your template as best as you can in the beginning - but don't sweat on small details. Just started using it, and you can improve it gradually. Use Tallyfy AI if you're feeling stuck to give you creative ideas for steps and templates.

![Template created](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-click-create-template-by-tallyfyai.png)

:::note[Refine each step]

Make each step unambiguous with precise action verbs at the beginning. A step named "Email estimate to customer for approval" is better and more precise than "Manage customer estimate".

:::

:::note[Create important steps first]

Concentrate on the primary actions required by team members, especially important ones that need tracking. You don't need every minute step in your process if you know it's common sense and people already know how to do those steps.

:::

:::note[Incorporate images and videos]

Enhance your step descriptions with images, videos, and links via the _Insert_ button. This captures critical knowledge about how someone does that step today, so that you can delegate it in future.

:::note[Think about data needed before you launch]

You can collect necessary information before a process begins using a "Kick off form". Imagine your template is called "New employee onboarding". It's reasonable to assume that you cannot begin to onboard a new employee without knowing their first name, last name, team, or other information - so those can be fields in your kick off form.

:::

:::note[Use task types to sharpen intent]

A task in Tallyfy has a "type" and by default it's just a "Task". However, you can also set other types like approvals, emails that need to be sent, etc. Search for "task types" in the search box above to learn more.

![Approval Tasks](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-switch-to-approvereject.png)

:::note[Assign every step to a person, job title, group, and so on]

There's various ways to assign a task for accountability. If you don't know who does the task, just enter the job title that _should_ do it.

:::

![Assign Task](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-assign-a-task-to-somebody.png)

:::note[Set deadlines if you need to]

Every step can have separate due dates. Since you're making a template - they are not real-dates, but relative dates. A due date can be a certain time after launching a process, or dynamically generated - after another step is completed.

:::

![Specify Deadline](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-specify-deadline-to-task.png)

:::note[Discover the power of automations]

Automations in Tallyfy are really simple "if this then that" rules that hide/show tasks, shift deadlines, assign certain people automatically and so on. They entirely replace complex flowcharts and they can do actions that flowcharts could _never_ do, so they're actually much better than flowcharts.

## Tips for documents

Tallyfy documents are not designed to download, but to _use_. You can use a document or playbook by launching it.

Customize templates in Tallyfy by marking fields which are editable via the _Builder_ section on the right of a document template. You can even set default content within editable fields. This means if I someone wants "their own version" of a document - they just launch the template, and either accept the defaults or customize the fields they are allowed to customize.

It's far better than getting a Word document and making a copy of it - resulting in two documents. People want (and need) to eliminate the clutter of hundreds of copies of the same document  lying around in random places.

### Add fields to your document

To add a new field, click on _New Field_ and select the type of field you want to add to your document. You can add **Short text**, for something like the name of a client or a project, **Long text** for a description or notes and **Date** for a deadline or the current date!.

![Add new field](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-add-field-document.png)

### Use existing fields 

Click on _Existing fields_ and drag the one you want to use into your document - they will fill in with whatever the value was. This is perfect for fields where you collect the data once like  "First Name" but you then have to pull that into many different spots throughout the template without re-entering it again, like on legal contracts.

## Tallyfy is better than Word, Google Docs or wikis

There's a bunch more features like re-usable content snippets, automatic translation, and tasks within documents.

You might be able to auto-migrate content between a documentation-only app to Tallyfy. Create a ticket with our support team to chat through this.

## Tallyfy is better than spreadsheets

Upgrade to organized structure, efficiency and controlled access. Stop fighting busywork hell via spreadsheets.
