snippet: A workflow platform enabling non-technical users to document track and automate
  business processes through reusable templates while providing real-time task visibility
  and continuous improvement capabilities.
title: Introduction
---

Tallyfy is a workflow platform designed for non-technical people. 

### Problems Tallyfy solves

* How can AI help create procedures quickly instead of writing for hours?
* How do you ensure people actually follow processes?
* How can tasks get done without constant reminders?
* How do you prevent tasks from being forgotten?
* How can you improve processes that nobody follows?
* How can AI automate tasks when everyone does them differently?
* How do you make sure work gets done the same way every time?

These are massive, under-rated, foundational problems. For example - it's very hard to use the power of AI if you don't have any agreed process with clear steps that people **already** follow today. 

It's like trying to build the roof of a house when you haven't even built the foundation! To run far better, digitized operations - you need to work on 3 stages, in this order.

### 1. Document - Store instructions

Keep all procedures in one place. People always forget stuff (it's called the "Forgetting Curve"), so having everything in one place helps everyone remember how to do things right. This is a great start, but if nobody reads this stuff - what's the point? And no - "quizzes" and "tests" will never work. Move up to stage 2.

### 2. Track - Follow progress

See who's doing what with automatic reminders. Using the guides helps people learn better, cuts down on update meetings, and makes sure work gets done the same way every time. It also makes sure that work and outcomes are consistent, predictable and standardized. Amazing, right? Move on to stage 3.

### 3. Improve - Keep getting better

Use AI to improve and automate your processes. Bake in improvements without retraining. Making every step better without hassle gives you an incredible competitive advantage as a business. It's like a secret recipe for compounding success. 

> "Improve 1% each day and you'll end up 37 times better after a year." - James Clear

### Why 3 stages in order? It's obvious

You can't improve or automate steps in a process that aren't documented *and* followed. Repeatable **processes** are far more valuable than projects because they are standardized, predictable, automatable, and improvable.

### Why workflow automation matters

Tallyfy helps you reduce routine work, track tasks in real time, and improve quality and efficiency through repeatable processes. 

Workflow automation eliminates time-wasting manual tasks and reduces errors, addressing issues like inconsistent processes and poor visibility into work status. 

Tallyfy provides a structured, transparent system for smooth work handoffs, consistent standards, and clear accountability, freeing teams to move on with higher-value activities.

### Platform overview

Tallyfy helps you:

- **Document** your processes clearly.
- **Launch** standard workflows easily.
- **Track** [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) progress live.
- **[Automate](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/)** repetitive steps using rules.

### Handling smaller, specific processes

Many vital business processes involve team or task workflows that lack dedicated software and are often managed informally (e.g., via email or spreadsheets). Tallyfy empowers business users to directly manage these by:

- Quickly documenting them as reusable [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).
- Launching and tracking them consistently.
- Automating steps where possible.

This self-service approach, with IT support when needed, reduces wasted effort and "shadow IT," bringing visibility and standards to everyday workflows.

## What kinds of processes is it best for?

Focus on processes currently managed manually (e.g., via email, chat, spreadsheets) where no dedicated app exists.

Tallyfy is particularly effective for processes that:

-   **Need structured data**: Require consistent information collection from your team or clients.
-   **Are frequent**: Occur often enough to benefit from digitization.
-   **Require standardization**: Workflows where it's important that tasks are done the same way every time to ensure quality or meet compliance standards.
-   **Need to scale or automate**: Processes you want to establish correctly now so you can handle higher volumes or automate steps in the future.
-   **Are complex**: Procedures with many steps, details, or conditional rules (like "if this, then that") that are hard for one person to remember accurately.
-   **Require an audit trail**: Any workflow where you need proof that specific steps were completed correctly and by whom.
-   **Need tracking**: Processes that require visibility for those doing the work, their managers, company leaders, or even customers.
-   **Must be predictable**: Workflows where everyone involved needs to know what has happened and what comes next.

If your process has several of these characteristics, Tallyfy Pro can likely help you manage it more effectively.

### Key benefits

Tallyfy helps organizations by:

- **Saving time**: Reduce routine administrative work.
- **Controlling quality**: Maintain consistent standards for all processes.
- **Showing real-time status**: See who is assigned what and track progress live.
- **Automating handovers**: Pass tasks between people smoothly.
- **Improving continuously**: Make processes better using data and feedback.

### Tallyfy's unique approach

Tallyfy focuses on:

- **Repeatable processes**, not just one-off projects.
- **Simple conditional logic** ("if this, then that"), not complex flowcharts.
- **Workflows centered on tasks**, not just data storage.
- **Integrating documentation with automation**.

## Getting started with Tallyfy

The most effective way to start with Tallyfy is in phases:

<Steps>
1.  **Document and centralize.** Document your main processes as Tallyfy [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), using AI features or importing existing documents. Centralize your standard operating procedures (SOPs) here.
2.  **Launch and track.** Launch key templates as active [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). Track task completion and introduce your team to completing [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in Tallyfy.
3.  **Automate and improve.** Explore [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) to streamline workflows. Use feedback and [analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/) data (if available) to continuously refine your templates.
</Steps>

Starting with documentation provides a solid foundation before introducing tracking and automation. This phased approach helps smooth the transition for your team.

### 1. Create or upload a template

[Templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) are central to Tallyfy. You can:

- Build a template from scratch.
- Use Tallyfy AI to generate a template draft.
- Import procedures you already have documented.

There are two main types of templates:
- **[Procedure templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)**: Define step-by-step processes, SOPs, or how-to guides containing tasks (e.g., employee onboarding, purchase approvals).
- **[Document templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/)**: Create standardized documents, policies, or reference materials with fillable [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) (e.g., social media policy, client contact list, WiFi passwords).

Here's an example of a customer onboarding template:

![Customer Onboarding Template Example](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-show-template-example.png)

### 2. Launch processes from templates

After creating a template, launch specific instances called [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/):

<Steps>
1. Choose your template.
2. Name the process instance descriptively (e.g., "Onboarding for Samsung," not just "Customer Onboarding").
3. Enter any required kick-off information.
4. Assign relevant people.
5. Launch the process.
</Steps>

Clear, specific names make processes easy to identify.

### 3. Track progress

Tallyfy automatically:
- Assigns [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) per the template.
- Sends relevant email updates.
- Tracks task completion status.
- Manages follow-ups and task handoffs between steps.

All participants can view the process status visually:

Individual tasks show detailed information and action buttons:

### 4. Continuously improve templates

Tallyfy helps improve repeatable processes by enabling you to:
- Collect feedback via comments within tasks and processes.
- Monitor task durations to identify bottlenecks.
- Easily update templates with improvements.
- Make lasting changes to standard procedures, preventing repeated mistakes.

## Best practices for template creation

Follow these tips when building your [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).

### Procedure template best practices

#### Start with a basic outline
List the main process steps, then add details later. Tallyfy AI can help draft an initial outline:

![Create a template using Tallyfy AI](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-create-client-onboarding-template-from-tallyfyAI.png)

#### Write clear step descriptions
Begin step descriptions with an action verb (e.g., **Send**, **Review**, **Upload**) and clearly state the required action.
- Good: "Email the estimate to the customer for approval."
- Avoid: "Customer estimate handling."

#### Add helpful media
Include images and videos in step descriptions to clarify complex instructions:

![Insert Media](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-add-media-to-tasks.png)

#### Use the right task types
Select the appropriate type (Task, Approve/Reject, Expiring Step, Email Draft, Auto-Send Email) for each step:

![Approval Tasks](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-switch-to-approvereject.png)

#### Assign clear responsibility
Specify who needs to complete each task:

![Assign Task](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-assign-a-task-to-somebody.png)

#### Set realistic deadlines
Define task due dates based on the process start date or the completion of previous tasks:

![Specify Deadline](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-specify-deadline-to-task.png)

#### Use automation rules
Apply conditional logic ("if this, then that" rules) for adaptive processes:

![Automation Rules](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-click-automations.png)

#### Plan how to collect data
Use [kick-off forms](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/) to gather information *before* a process starts:

![Kick-off Form](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-how-to-add-kickoff-forms.png)

### Document template best practices

Tallyfy [document templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) create forms for use within the platform, not primarily for download.

#### Add fields to your document
Click **New Field** to add various [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/), like **Short text**, **Long text**, **Date**, and more.

![Add new field](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-add-field-document.png)

#### Reuse existing fields
Use **Existing fields** to add fields already defined elsewhere, ensuring consistency:
