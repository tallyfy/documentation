## Tallyfy believes in Workflow Made Easy<sup>®</sup>

Tallyfy empowers you to fight and eliminate the busywork of meetings, manual status updates and reporting - and gives you an automatic, real-time answer to "What is the status?" for any given task or any given process.

You can set and forget a template for any playbook, SOP, approval workflow, procedure or process. Tallyfy automatically moves tasks between people and auto-reminds everyone what they need to do and when. It also hides tasks that aren't necessary and runs automated rules to remove manual admin.

Tallyfy is designed for anyone - including people with no technical or process expertise at all. Here's a quick summary of what Tallyfy does and doesn't do:

* **Tallyfy focuses on repeatable processes** - not projects, so Tallyfy is not a project management app.
* **Tallyfy doesn't use flowcharts anywhere** - they are complex, out-dated and if-this-then-that automations can achieve a lot more than flowcharts _ever_ could.
* **Tallyfy covers your entire set of needs** - when it comes to process, Tallyfy doesn't just let you document them. You can also run, track and automate them.
* **Tallyfy doesn't currently move data between apps** - it moves tasks between people. If you need integrations, middleware apps [may be more appropriate](https://tallyfy.com/products/pro/integrations/).

## Create a template

The first step to running a process is to create a template for it. You can build a template from scratch or with Tallyfy AI to standardize operations and save time. Templates can be procedures or documents. Here's a screenshot of a template to onboard new customers the right way, every time:

## Launch and track processes

Launch a new process using a template (it's like making a copy of a recipe) - automatically assigning tasks and managing follow-ups and hand-offs. A process is when you're "using" the template for a _specific_ employee, customer, approval and so on. You can launch many processes from a template. Here's a view to track the status of processes:

Everyone involved can track every task individually and see what is done and not done.

## Improve continuously

You don't have to keep improving your template - but it's a really good idea to do so via feedback or brainstorming sessions. People can add feedback on the template itself on Tallyfy using simple comments.

With continuos improvement - your operations will keep getting better and better, and every mistake you learn from will be baked into the template so that you don't make the same mistake again.

When you make incremental improvements you get significant gains over time, outpacing your competitors and enhancing efficiency. You can't get compound, incremental, permanent improvements easily with ad-hoc projects and ad-hoc tasks.

Tallyfy specializes in _process management_ - not project management. The difference is huge - because processes are scalable, repeatable, improvable and predictable. Projects are _none_ of those things.

## Tips to create great document templates

Tallyfy documents are not designed to download, but to _use_. You use a document or playbook by launching it.

Customize templates in Tallyfy by marking fields which are editable via the _Builder_. You can even set default content within editable fields. This means if I someone wants "their own version" of a document - they just launch the template, and either accept the defaults or customize the fields they are allowed to customize with whatever they like.

### Add reusable fields to your document

To add a new field, click on _New Field_ and select the type of field you want to add to your document. You can add **Short text**, for something like the name of a client or a project, **Long text** for a description or notes and **Date** for a deadline or the current date!.

![Add new field](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-add-field-document.png)

### Use existing fields in your document

Click on _Existing fields_ and drag the one you want to use into your document - they will fill in with whatever the value collected was - great for fields where you collect the data once e.g. "First Name" but then have to pull it into many different slots throughout the document without re-entering it again.

![Select existing field](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-select-existing-field-document.png)

Edit and view documents on any device with features like re-usable content snippets, automatic translation, and mobile-ready UI's.

## Better than Word or Google Docs or wikis

Tallyfy eliminates the inefficiencies of traditional documents. No more random copies scattered around, and no more giant attachments over email.

You might be able to auto-migrate content between a documentation-only app to Tallyfy. Get in touch with us to talk about this.

## Move from flowcharts to flowtables

Flowcharts just don't compare to Tallyfy FlowTables. They lack instructions, timings and the ability to be easily consumed on mobile devices. Plus, Tallyfy fosters collaboration and creativity for modern teams - not a command-and-control culture with flowcharts.

## Better than spreadsheets

Upgrade to organized structure, efficiency and controlled access. Stop fighting busywork hell via spreadsheets.
