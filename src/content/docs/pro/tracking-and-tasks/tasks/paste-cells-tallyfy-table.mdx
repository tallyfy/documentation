## How to paste data from Excel/CSV into a Table form field

If you have data in a spreadsheet (like Microsoft Excel or a CSV file) that you need to enter into a Tallyfy **Table** [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/), you don't have to type it all in manually. You can copy and paste the data directly.

### Before you paste:

*   **Matching Headers are Crucial**: The column headers in your spreadsheet file **must exactly match** the column headers set up in the Tallyfy Table field. Tallyfy will only paste data into columns where the headers match. If headers don't match, the data for that column won't be pasted.
*   **Format**: Your spreadsheet data should be copied to your clipboard (e.g., select cells in Excel and press Ctrl+C or Cmd+C).

### Pasting into the Tallyfy Table

<Steps>
1. Go to the Tallyfy task containing the Table field you want to paste into.
2. Click the menu button (often three dots or similar) at the top-right corner *of the table field itself*.
3. Select the option **Paste rows from Excel/CSV** (or similar wording).
4. A box will appear. Paste your copied spreadsheet data into this box (Ctrl+V or Cmd+V).
5. Click the button to confirm the paste (e.g., "Paste" or "Import").
</Steps>

The data from your clipboard will be added as new rows in the Tallyfy table, matching the columns based on the headers. Blank cells in your copied data will result in blank cells in the Tallyfy table.
