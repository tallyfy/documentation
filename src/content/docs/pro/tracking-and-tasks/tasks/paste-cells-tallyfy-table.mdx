## How to paste cells into a Tallyfy table

Sometimes you'll have a lengthy list of items that you need to add to a Tallyfy table. Instead of manually entering each item, you can paste them directly into the table if it's either in CSV or Excel format.

## Pasting cells into a Tallyfy table

:::note[Note on pasting cells]

To paste cells into a Tallyfy table, you need to have the data in either CSV or Excel format. If you have the data in another format, you'll need to convert it to CSV or Excel before pasting it into the table.

You'll also need to have the same headers on the table as the columns in your CSV or Excel file. This will ensure that the data is pasted correctly into the table. **Tallyfy will only paste the data into the columns that match the headers in your file.**

:::

To paste cells into a Tallyfy table:

1. Go to your table field and click on the top-right button.
2. Select "Copy rows from Excel/CSV" from the dropdown menu.
3. Select the file that contains the data you want to paste.
4. Click on "Open" to paste the data into the table.

Note that even if there's blank data on any row, Tallyfy will leave that row blank in the table.
