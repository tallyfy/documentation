## Import data from Excel/CSV into a Table form field

You can import data from an Excel or CSV file directly into a Tallyfy **Table** [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/). No retyping needed.

### What should I know before importing?

- **Column order matters**: Data from your spreadsheet is mapped to the Tallyfy table by column position - the first column in your file maps to the first column in the table, second to second, and so on. Make sure your spreadsheet columns are in the same order as the Tallyfy table columns.
- **Supported file types**: .xlsx, .xls, and .csv files are accepted.
- **First row is skipped**: The first row of your file is treated as a header row and won't be imported as data.

### How do I import data into the Tallyfy table?

<Steps>
1. Open the Tallyfy task with the Table field you want to import data into.
2. Click the menu icon (bars icon) in the table header area.
3. Select **Copy rows from Excel/CSV**.
4. A file picker opens. Choose your .xlsx, .xls, or .csv file.
</Steps>

The rows from your file are added to the table automatically. Blank cells in your spreadsheet stay blank in Tallyfy.
