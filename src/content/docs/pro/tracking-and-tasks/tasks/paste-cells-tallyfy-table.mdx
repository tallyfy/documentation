## How to paste data from Excel/CSV into a Table form field

If you have data in a spreadsheet (like Microsoft Excel or a CSV file) that you need in a Tallyfy **Table** [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/), you don't have to retype it. You can paste it directly.

### Before you paste

*   **Matching headers are crucial**: The column headers in your spreadsheet **must exactly match** the column headers configured in the Tallyfy Table field. Tallyfy will only paste data where headers match. If headers don't match, data for that column is ignored.
*   **Copy data**: Copy the spreadsheet data (including headers) to your clipboard (e.g., select the cells in Excel and press `Ctrl+C` or `Cmd+C`).

### Pasting into the Tallyfy table

<Steps>
1. Open the Tallyfy task with the Table field you want to paste data into.
2. Click the menu icon (...) at the top right *of the Table field* itself.
3. Select **Paste rows from Excel/CSV** (or similar wording).
4. A pop-up box appears. Paste your copied data here (`Ctrl+V` or `Cmd+V`).
5. Click the **Paste** button.
</Steps>

The data from your clipboard will be added as new rows to the table, matching columns based on headers. Blank cells from your spreadsheet will result in blank cells in the Tallyfy table.
