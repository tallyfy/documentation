## Overview of available form field types

[Form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) are how you collect info within Tallyfy [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/). Add them to the **Kick-off Form** (filled before the process starts) or to individual tasks in the process.

:::tip[Form fields create variables]
Remember that data entered in these fields is often what you use later via [variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/).
:::

This article describes the types of form fields available.

:::note[Required vs. optional]
You can mark most fields as required (must be filled) or optional. Checklists use validation rules instead.
:::

:::note[Guidance text]
All field types allow adding extra help text (Guidance Text) below the label to give more instructions.
