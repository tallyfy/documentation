## What form field types are available in Tallyfy?

Form fields are how you collect info within Tallyfy tasks. You can add them to the **Kick-off Form** (filled before the process starts) or to individual tasks in the process. This gives you a solid way to gather structured data throughout your workflow.

:::tip[Form fields create variables]
Remember that data entered in these fields is often what you use later via [variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/).

Here are the different types of form fields you can use.

:::note[Required vs. optional]
You can mark most fields as required (must be filled) or optional. Checklists use validation rules instead.
:::

:::note[Guidance text]
All field types allow adding extra help text (Guidance Text) below the label to give more instructions.

### How do different field types work?

#### Short text
*   Single line for short text (up to 200 characters).
*   Use for names, IDs, emails, URLs, numbers, etc.
*   **Options**: Enforce validation (e.g., must be number, email, URL), min/max length, prefix/suffix (e.g., $, kg).

#### Dropdown list
*   Lets users pick **one** option from a list you create.
*   **Options**: Define list items, set default.
*   Use when there are several choices, one allowed (e.g., select department).

#### Checklist

*   **Options**: Define list items, set defaults, validation (require 'at least one' or 'all items').
*   Use for sub-task lists, required docs, feature selection. See [Create Subtasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-create-and-use-subtasks/).

#### Table
*   Create a table with columns you define. Users add rows of data.
*   **Options**: Define column headers. No default content.
*   Use for collecting structured lists (e.g., order line items, attendee lists).
*   **Adding Columns**: When setting up the field in the template editor, click **Add New Column** to define the structure.
*   **Using in Tasks**: When the task is active, users click **Add Row** to enter data into the table you defined.
*   **Using with Variables**: You can insert the entire table's data into a later step description using the [Insert Variable](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/how-can-i-use-insert-variables-in-tallyfy/) feature.
*   **Using in Rules**: You can create [automation rules](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) that check if a specific column within the table **Contains** a certain value.

#### Assignee picker
*   Lets user select a Tallyfy member or group.
*   **Options**: Set as required.
*   Use when the person doing a later task needs to be chosen during the process.

### What other field settings are available?

Most fields also have these settings available when setting them up:

*   **Name**: Field label (the question).
*   **Guidance**: Optional help text below the label. Add this in the **Advanced** section of the field settings within the template editor. It appears in italics below the field name when the task is active, and any URLs included become clickable links.
*   **Field Alias**: Unique internal ID for integrations (API/Webhooks). It is automatically generated based on the *first* name you give the field and **does not change** even if you edit the field name later. This ensures that variables or integrations using the alias continue to work.
*   **Required**: Mark if required before task completion.
*   **Default Value**: Set default value (can use variables for text fields). See [Set default content for form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-set-default-content-for-form-fields/) for detailed instructions.

Remember, incomplete optional form fields can be seen and addressed in completed tasks.
