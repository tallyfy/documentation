## Form field types in Tallyfy

Form fields let Tallyfy processes collect user input that can change how the process flows. Add them to the **Kick-off Form** (filled before the process starts) or to individual tasks.

:::tip[Form fields create variables]
Input collected through form fields becomes data that processes use to modify their flow via [variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/) and [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/).
:::

:::note[Required vs. optional]
You can mark most fields as required or optional. Checklists use validation rules instead.
:::

:::note[Guidance text]
All field types support adding help text (Guidance Text) below the label to guide users.
:::

### How do different field types work?

#### Short text
*   Single line for brief input (up to 200 characters).
*   **Options**: Validation rules (numeric, email, URL, alpha, alpha_num, alpha_dash), min/max length, prefix/suffix (e.g., $, kg).
*   **Tip**: Store [file request links](mdc:products/pro/integrations/document-management/file-request-links/) from your document management system for secure external file collection.

#### Long text
*   Multi-line input for detailed responses (up to 30,000 characters).
*   **Options**: Enable rich text formatting (bold, lists) via the WYSIWYG editor toggle.
*   Use for descriptions, notes, or feedback.

:::tip[Rich text copy/paste behavior]
**When pasting from Microsoft Word or other apps**, formatting is stripped to prevent broken HTML. Use the formatting toolbar to reapply styles after pasting.

**Preserving complex formatting**:
- **Option 1**: Use "Show HTML" toggle to paste raw HTML
- **Option 2**: Use an online HTML editor, then copy clean HTML into Tallyfy
- **Option 3**: Set up [global branding CSS](/products/pro/settings/org-settings/how-can-i-personalize-my-tallyfy-branding-and-emails/) for consistent styling
:::

#### Dropdown list
*   Pick **one** option from a list. Useful for branching workflows (e.g., selecting a department determines approvers).
*   **Options**: Define list items, set default, add prefix/suffix.
*   **Important**: When reordering options in the template editor, click save explicitly. Changes won't persist if you leave the page without saving.

#### Checklist
*   Check **one or more** items from a list.
*   **Options**: Define list items, set defaults, validation (require 'at least one' via the required flag, or 'all items' via the must-all-checked setting).
*   Use for requirements lists where checked items determine next steps. See [Create Subtasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-create-and-use-subtasks/).
    ![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-checklist-field.png)

#### Radio buttons
*   Pick **only one** option. Requires at least 2 options.
*   **Options**: Define list items, set default.
*   Great for Yes/No decisions or priority levels that branch the process.
    ![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-radiobuttons-field.png)

#### Date
*   Pick a date (and optionally time) from a calendar. The `collect_time` toggle controls whether time selection appears.
*   **Options**: Set a default date (e.g., today, today + 7 days).
*   Use for deadlines, start dates, meeting dates, and other scheduling.
    ![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-datetime-field.png)

#### File upload
*   Upload file(s) up to 100MB each[^2].
*   **Options**: Set as required.
*   Use for collecting docs, images, or reports. Supports multiple file uploads in a single field.
*   **Alternative**: For sensitive or larger files, use [file request links](mdc:products/pro/integrations/document-management/file-request-links/) from your document management system.
    ![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-file-upload-field.png)

#### Table
*   Define columns, and users add rows of data. Default values aren't supported for tables.
*   **Adding columns**: In the template editor, click **Add New Column** to define the structure.
*   **Using in tasks**: Users click **Add Row** to enter data into your defined table.
*   **Using with variables**: Insert the entire table's data into a later step description using the [Insert Variable](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/how-can-i-use-insert-variables-in-tallyfy/) feature.
*   **Using in rules**: Create [automation rules](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) that check if a specific column **Contains** a certain value.

#### Assignee picker
*   Select a Tallyfy member, guest, or group. Default values aren't supported for this field type.
*   **Options**: Set as required.
*   Use when the person doing a later task needs to be chosen during the process.

:::important[Assignee picker captures data but doesn't auto-assign]
**The assignee picker captures who was selected but does NOT automatically reassign tasks.**

To use the selected assignee, create an automation rule:
1. Add the assignee picker field to your step
2. Go to **Automations** in your template
3. Create a rule with:
   - **IF condition**: When the step with assignee picker is completed
   - **THEN action**: Assign/unassign specific tasks
   - Use the assignee picker field value to determine assignment

**Common use case**: Manager selects team member in Step 1 → Automation assigns Step 2 to that person.

Without the automation rule, the selection is just stored data. It won't change any task assignments.
:::

### Form field limitations

:::note[Calculations not supported]
**Tallyfy form fields don't support automatic calculations** (e.g., Unit Price x Quantity = Total).

**Workarounds**:
1. **External calculation** - Users calculate externally and enter the result
2. **Guidance text** - Provide calculation instructions in the field's guidance text
3. **Automation rules** - Route to different steps based on entered values
4. **Webhooks/API** - Send data to external calculation services
5. **Multiple fields** - Collect components separately (price, quantity) and calculate in reporting
:::

:::tip[Deleting form fields with rule dependencies]
**Can't delete a form field?** If it's referenced in automation rules in other steps, you'll see: "Cannot delete a form field that is being used in a rule in other steps." Delete or modify those rules first, then delete the field.
:::

### What other field settings are available?

Most fields have these settings:

*   **Name**: The field label (the question your process asks).
*   **Guidance**: Optional help text below the label. Add this in the **Advanced** section of field settings in the template editor. It appears in italics below the field name when the task is active, and any URLs become clickable links.
*   **Field Alias[^1]**: Auto-generated internal ID based on the *first* name you give the field. It **doesn't change** even if you rename the field later, so automations and integrations using the alias keep working.
*   **Required**: Whether this field must be filled before the task can be completed.
*   **Default Value**: Pre-fill a value (can use variables for text fields). Not available for table, file upload, or assignee picker fields. See [Set default content for form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-set-default-content-for-form-fields/) for details.

[^1]: System-generated ID frozen after creation, safe for API/webhook integrations even if field renamed
[^2]: Single file limit; multiple files can be uploaded but each must be under 100MB individually
