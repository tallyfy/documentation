## Overview of available form fields

[Form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) are an essential part of organizing and gathering information within [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), forms, and [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in Tallyfy. There are two types of form fields: Kick-off Form Fields and Step or Task Form Fields. Kick-off form fields are the ones that appear before a process can be launched, while all other form fields appear within steps or tasks.

:::tip[Form Fields: The Source of Variable Data]
Think of the information you collect using these form fields (like a customer name, email address, or project ID) as the starting point for [variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/). Often, the data entered into a form field becomes the "package" that a variable, acting like a mail carrier, delivers to other steps in your process where that information is needed.
:::

This article provides an overview of the different types of form fields available in Tallyfy.

:::note[Required vs. Optional Fields]
All fields can be set to required or not required except the Checklist - which has no required/not required setting. Note that if you set default content in a field, the required setting may not apply since the field already has a value selected.
:::

:::note[Guidance Text]
All field types support guidance text, which is a block of help text that shows up when people interact with a field. This text helps users understand what the field is for and how to properly fill it out.

### Types

Tallyfy offers various field types to help you organize and collect information effectively.

#### Short text field

A single-line text field that allows you to capture up to 200 characters of information.

**Settings and Validation Options:**
- **Validation types:**
  - No validation (Default)
  - Enforce number only
  - Enforce a single email address only
  - Enforce a URL only
  - Enforce an integer only
  - Enforce alphabetical characters only
  - Enforce alphabetical and numeric characters only
- **Data length validation:** Set minimum or maximum number of characters allowed
- **Default content:** Pre-fill the field with text or variables from other fields in the process
- **Prefix:** Add text that appears before the input (e.g., "$")
- **Suffix:** Add text that appears after the input (e.g., "cars" or "houses")

**Best Practices:**
- **DO:** Use short text fields for collecting specific, concise information like names, IDs, or single data points
- **DON'T:** Use for collecting detailed explanations or multiple pieces of information that should be broken into separate fields
- **Example:** For collecting a customer reference number, use a short text field with number-only validation and a prefix like "REF-"

#### Long text field

A field that can hold a large amount of text, with a character limit of 6,000.

![Long Text Field](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-long-text-field.png)

**Settings and Options:**
- **Rich text (WYSIWYG) editor:** Toggle on/off to allow formatting options
- **Default content:** Pre-fill the field with text or variables from other fields in the process

**Best Practices:**
- **DO:** Use for detailed descriptions, instructions, or when capturing comprehensive feedback
- **DON'T:** Use for data that needs to be analyzed or sorted (structured data is better for analysis)
- **Example:** When gathering detailed incident reports or collecting comprehensive customer feedback, use a long text field with the rich text editor enabled so users can format their responses for better readability

#### Dropdown list

Choose one option from a drop-down list.

![Dropdown List Field](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-dropdown-list.png)

**Settings and Requirements:**
- Requires at least two options to be entered
- You can set one of the dropdown options as the default choice

**Best Practices:**
- **DO:** Use when there are multiple predefined options but only one selection is needed
- **DON'T:** Use when multiple selections should be possible (use Checklist instead)
- **Example:** For a status field with options like "Pending," "In Progress," "Complete," or "Cancelled," a dropdown ensures users select only one valid status

#### Checklist

Select one or multiple options from a list.

![Checklist Field](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-checklist-field.png)

**Settings and Validation Options:**
- **Validation types:**
  - No validation (Default)
  - At least one item must be checked
  - All items must be checked
- You can set default choices that are pre-checked in the checklist

**Best Practices:**
- **DO:** Use checklists for procedural verification steps or when multiple selections from a defined list are needed
- **DON'T:** Use when items need to be mutually exclusive (use Radio Buttons instead)
- **Example:** For a pre-flight checklist where multiple safety checks need to be verified, use a checklist with "All items must be checked" validation

Tallyfy's [checklist software](https://tallyfy.com/solutions/checklist-software/) capabilities go beyond simple lists to create accountability, tracking, and standardization throughout your processes.

:::

#### Radio buttons

Insert several options and select a single option from the list. This field type is suitable for a short list of choices.

![Radio Buttons Field](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-radiobuttons-field.png)

**Settings and Requirements:**
- Requires at least two options to be entered
- You can set a default choice that's pre-selected

**Best Practices:**
- **DO:** Use when you need to display all options visibly at once for quick selection
- **DON'T:** Use when there are many options (use Dropdown instead) or when multiple selections are needed
- **Example:** For a priority selection with options like "Low," "Medium," "High," radio buttons make all choices immediately visible and ensure only one priority is selected

#### Date

Capture a date and time, with options to select the year, month, day, and time.

![Date and Time Field](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-datetime-field.png)

**Settings and Default Options:**
- **Default date options:**
  - The current date and time
  - The current date and time plus or minus a certain number of days
- Tallyfy stores the actual date and time entered only, with no timezone conversion

**Best Practices:**
- **DO:** Use for capturing event dates, deadlines, or timestamps that will be used for scheduling or reporting
- **DON'T:** Use when only collecting general timeframes where precise dates aren't necessary
- **Example:** For scheduling a follow-up meeting, use a date field with "current date plus 7 days" as the default to suggest a one-week follow-up

#### File upload

Upload multiple files up to a 100Mb limit per file. Accepts various file types.

![File Upload Field](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-file-upload-field.png)

**Features and Limitations:**
- Allows multiple files to be uploaded
- Has file size limitations (100MB per file)
- Accepts various common file types

**Best Practices:**
- **DO:** Use when documentation, evidence, or specific files are needed for a process
- **DON'T:** Use as the only method of collecting information when structured data is also needed
- **Example:** For collecting signed contracts or supporting documentation, use a file upload field with guidance text specifying acceptable file types

#### Table

A table field allows you to define the columns of a table, which can then be filled in by the assignee once the process goes live.

**Settings and Requirements:**
- You need to enter at least one column name
- It does not have any default content options

**Best Practices:**
- **DO:** Use for collecting structured, repetitive data with multiple entries of the same type
- **DON'T:** Use for single data points or when the structure of the data varies widely
- **Example:** For recording inventory items with attributes like item name, quantity, and price, a table allows users to add multiple entries in a structured format

#### Assignee picker

An assignee picker field allows you to dynamically select one or more people as assignees for tasks.

![Assignee Picker Field](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-assignee-picker.png)

**Settings and Requirements:**
- If set to required, at least one assignee must be selected
- Allows selection from groups, [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/), or [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) within your organization

**Best Practices:**
- **DO:** Use when task ownership needs to be determined during process execution rather than predefined
- **DON'T:** Use when assignees are fixed and won't change based on process context
- **Example:** In an approval process where the approver depends on the transaction amount, use an assignee picker to allow the initiator to select the appropriate approver based on company policy

### Additional settings

To add more functionality to your forms, Tallyfy provides additional settings for each field:

- **Name**: A label that explains the requirement of the form field.
- **Guidance**: Additional description, instructions, or examples to help complete the field.
- **Field alias**: Required for [webhooks integration](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) to refer to this field.
- **Options**: Provide selectable options for a field.
- **Required**: Indicate whether a field is optional or required for completion.
- **Default value**: Pre-fill the field with a default value, which can be a variable in the cases of short-text and long text fields that don't use the rich text option.

Remember, incomplete form fields can be spotted and addressed in completed tasks.
