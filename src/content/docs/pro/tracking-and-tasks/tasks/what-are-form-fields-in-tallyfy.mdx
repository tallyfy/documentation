## Overview of available form field types

[Form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) are how you collect info within Tallyfy [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/). Add them to the **Kick-off Form** (filled before the process starts) or to individual tasks in the process.

:::tip[Form fields create variables]
Remember that data entered in these fields is often what you use later via [variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/).
:::

This article describes the types of form fields available.

:::note[Required vs. optional]
You can mark most fields as required (must be filled) or optional. Checklists use validation rules instead.

:::note[Guidance text]
All field types allow adding extra help text (Guidance Text) below the label to give more instructions.

*   **Using in Tasks**: When the task is active, users click **Add Row** to enter data into the table you defined.
*   **Using with Variables**: You can insert the entire table's data into a later step description using the [Insert Variable](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/how-can-i-use-insert-variables-in-tallyfy/) feature.
*   **Using in Rules**: You can create [automation rules](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) that check if a specific column within the table **Contains** a certain value.

#### Assignee picker
*   Lets user select a Tallyfy member or group.
*   **Options**: Set as required.
*   Use when the person doing a later task needs to be chosen during the process.

### Other field settings

Most fields also have these settings available when setting them up:

*   **Name**: Field label (the question).
*   **Guidance**: Optional help text below the label. Add this in the **Advanced** section of the field settings within the template editor. It appears in italics below the field name when the task is active, and any URLs included become clickable links.
*   **Field Alias**: Unique internal ID for integrations (API/Webhooks). It is automatically generated based on the *first* name you give the field and **does not change** even if you edit the field name later. This ensures that variables or integrations using the alias continue to work.
*   **Required**: Mark if required before task completion.
*   **Default Value**: Set default value (can use variables for text fields).

Remember, incomplete optional form fields can be seen and addressed in completed tasks.
