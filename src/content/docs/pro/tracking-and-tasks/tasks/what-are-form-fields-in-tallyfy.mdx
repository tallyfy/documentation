## What types of form fields exist in Tallyfy

Form fields are an essential part of organizing and gathering information within processes, forms, and tasks in Tallyfy. There are two types of form fields: Kick-off Form Fields and Step or Task Form Fields. Kick-off form fields are the ones that appear before a process can be launched, while all other form fields appear within steps or tasks.

Let's explore the different types of form fields available and how they can help you in your workflow.

## Types

Tallyfy offers various field types to help you organize and collect information effectively. Let's take a look at some of them:

### Short Text

A single-line text field that allows you to capture up to 200 characters of information.

- Short text fields allow you to set validation options in it, such as email, URL, phone number, etc.

- You can set a default value for the field, which will be pre-filled when the form is opened. This default field can either be a manual entry, or a [variable](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/how-can-i-use-insert-variables-in-tallyfy/)

### Long Text

A field that can hold a large amount of text, with a character limit of 6,000.

- Long text fields allow you to use **Rich text** formatting, which includes bold, italic, underline, bullet points, and numbered lists. You can learn more about rich text formatting [here](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/edit-task/how-can-i-use-tallyfys-rich-text-editor-for-tasks/).

- Similar to short text fields, long text fields allow you to set default values and guidance text.

If you choose to use the rich text editor for a long text field, you'll still be able to use variables in the default value. However, you won't be able to use variables for the default value specifically.

### Dropdown List

Choose one option from a drop-down list.

- Dropdown lists allow you to choose a default value from the list of options.

### Checklist

Select one or multiple options from a list.

- Dropdown lists allow you to choose a default value from the list of options.

### Radio Buttons

Insert several options and select a single option from the list. Great for a short list of choices.

- Radio buttons allow you to choose a default value from the list of options.

### Date and Time

Capture a date and time, with options to select the year, month, day, and time.

![Date and Time Field](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-datetime-field.png)

- Date and time fields allow you to set a default value, which can be the current date and time or a specific date and time.
- Tallyfy entirely ignores your current timezone and stores the actual date and time entered only, with no conversion or assumption of timezone. When the information entered renders, we ignore the timezone in that situation as well. There's no usage of timezones and they have no relevance when it comes to a date and time field.

### File Upload

Upload multiple files up to a 100Mb limit per file. Accepts various file types.

### Table field

A table field allows you to define the columns of a table, which can then be filled in by the assignee once the process goes live.

### Assignee picker

An assignee picker field allows you to dynamicaly assign the task to an assignee.

## Additional Settings

To make your forms even more robust, Tallyfy provides additional settings for each field:

- **Name**: A label that explains the requirement of the form field.
- **Guidance**: Additional description, instructions, or examples to help complete the field.
- **Field alias**: Required for webhooks integration to refer to this field.
- **Options**: Provide selectable options for a field.
- **Required**: Indicate whether a field is optional or required for completion.
- **Default value**: Pre-fill the field with a default value, which can be a variable in the cases of short-text and long text fields that don't use the rich text option.

Now you have a better understanding of the different form field types and how to customize them. Start gathering information seamlessly with Tallyfy!

Remember, incomplete form fields can easily be spotted and addressed in completed tasks.
