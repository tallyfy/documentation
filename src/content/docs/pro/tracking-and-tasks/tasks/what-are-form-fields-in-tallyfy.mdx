## What types of form fields exist in Tallyfy

Form fields are an essential part of organizing and gathering information within processes, forms, and tasks in Tallyfy. There are two types of form fields: Kick-off Form Fields and Step or Task Form Fields. Kick-off form fields are the ones that appear before a process can be launched, while all other form fields appear within steps or tasks.

This article provides an overview of the different types of form fields available in Tallyfy.

:::note[Required vs. Optional Fields]
All fields can be set to required or not required except the Checklist - which has no required/not required setting. Note that if you set default content in a field, the required setting may not apply since the field already has a value selected.
:::

:::note[Guidance Text]
All field types support guidance text, which is a block of help text that shows up when people interact with a field. This text helps users understand what the field is for and how to properly fill it out.

## Types

Tallyfy offers various field types to help you organize and collect information effectively.

### Short Text Field

A single-line text field that allows you to capture up to 200 characters of information.

**Settings and Validation Options:**
- **Validation types:**
  - No validation (Default)
  - Enforce number only
  - Enforce a single email address only
  - Enforce a URL only
  - Enforce an integer only
  - Enforce alphabetical characters only
  - Enforce alphabetical and numeric characters only
- **Data length validation:** Set minimum or maximum number of characters allowed
- **Default content:** Pre-fill the field with text or variables from other fields in the process
- **Prefix:** Add text that appears before the input (e.g., "$")
- **Suffix:** Add text that appears after the input (e.g., "cars" or "houses")

**Best Practices:**
- **DO:** Use short text fields for collecting specific, concise information like names, IDs, or single data points
- **DON'T:** Use for collecting detailed explanations or multiple pieces of information that should be broken into separate fields
- **Example:** For collecting a customer reference number, use a short text field with number-only validation and a prefix like "REF-"

### Long Text Field

A field that can hold a large amount of text, with a character limit of 6,000.

![Long Text Field](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-long-text-field.png)

**Settings and Options:**
- **Rich text (WYSIWYG) editor:** Toggle on/off to allow formatting options
- **Default content:** Pre-fill the field with text or variables from other fields in the process

**Best Practices:**
- **DO:** Use for detailed descriptions, instructions, or when capturing comprehensive feedback
- **DON'T:** Use for data that needs to be analyzed or sorted (structured data is better for analysis)
- **Example:** When gathering detailed incident reports or collecting comprehensive customer feedback, use a long text field with the rich text editor enabled so users can format their responses for better readability

### Dropdown List

Choose one option from a drop-down list.

![Dropdown List Field](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-dropdown-list.png)

**Settings and Requirements:**
- Requires at least two options to be entered
- You can set one of the dropdown options as the default choice

**Best Practices:**
- **DO:** Use when there are multiple predefined options but only one selection is needed
- **DON'T:** Use when multiple selections should be possible (use Checklist instead)
- **Example:** For a status field with options like "Pending," "In Progress," "Complete," or "Cancelled," a dropdown ensures users select only one valid status

### Checklist

Select one or multiple options from a list.

![Checklist Field](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-checklist-field.png)

**Settings and Validation Options:**
- **Validation types:**
  - No validation (Default)
  - At least one item must be checked
  - All items must be checked
- You can set default choices that are pre-checked in the checklist

**Best Practices:**
- **DO:** Use checklists for procedural verification steps or when multiple selections from a defined list are needed
- **DON'T:** Use when items need to be mutually exclusive (use Radio Buttons instead)
- **Example:** For a pre-flight checklist where multiple safety checks need to be verified, use a checklist with "All items must be checked" validation

:::

### Radio Buttons

Insert several options and select a single option from the list. Great for a short list of choices.

![Radio Buttons Field](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-radiobuttons-field.png)

**Settings and Requirements:**
- Requires at least two options to be entered
- You can set a default choice that's pre-selected

**Best Practices:**
- **DO:** Use when you need to display all options visibly at once for quick selection
- **DON'T:** Use when there are many options (use Dropdown instead) or when multiple selections are needed
- **Example:** For a priority selection with options like "Low," "Medium," "High," radio buttons make all choices immediately visible and ensure only one priority is selected

### Date

Capture a date and time, with options to select the year, month, day, and time.

![Date and Time Field](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-datetime-field.png)

**Settings and Default Options:**
- **Default date options:**
  - The current date and time
  - The current date and time plus or minus a certain number of days
- Tallyfy stores the actual date and time entered only, with no timezone conversion

**Best Practices:**
- **DO:** Use for capturing event dates, deadlines, or timestamps that will be used for scheduling or reporting
- **DON'T:** Use when only collecting general timeframes where precise dates aren't necessary
- **Example:** For scheduling a follow-up meeting, use a date field with "current date plus 7 days" as the default to suggest a one-week follow-up

### File Upload

Upload multiple files up to a 100Mb limit per file. Accepts various file types.

![File Upload Field](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-file-upload-field.png)

**Features and Limitations:**
- Allows multiple files to be uploaded
- Has file size limitations (100MB per file)
- Accepts various common file types

**Best Practices:**
- **DO:** Use when documentation, evidence, or specific files are needed for a process
- **DON'T:** Use as the only method of collecting information when structured data is also needed
- **Example:** For collecting signed contracts or supporting documentation, use a file upload field with guidance text specifying acceptable file types

### Table

A table field allows you to define the columns of a table, which can then be filled in by the assignee once the process goes live.

**Settings and Requirements:**
- You need to enter at least one column name
- It does not have any default content options

**Best Practices:**
- **DO:** Use for collecting structured, repetitive data with multiple entries of the same type
- **DON'T:** Use for single data points or when the structure of the data varies widely
- **Example:** For recording inventory items with attributes like item name, quantity, and price, a table allows users to add multiple entries in a structured format

### Assignee Picker

An assignee picker field allows you to dynamically select one or more people as assignees for tasks.

![Assignee Picker Field](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-assignee-picker.png)

**Settings and Requirements:**
- If set to required, at least one assignee must be selected
- Allows selection from groups, members, or guests within your organization

**Best Practices:**
- **DO:** Use when task ownership needs to be determined during process execution rather than predefined
- **DON'T:** Use when assignees are fixed and won't change based on process context
- **Example:** In an approval process where the approver depends on the transaction amount, use an assignee picker to allow the initiator to select the appropriate approver based on company policy

## Additional Settings

To make your forms even more robust, Tallyfy provides additional settings for each field:

- **Name**: A label that explains the requirement of the form field.
- **Guidance**: Additional description, instructions, or examples to help complete the field.
- **Field alias**: Required for webhooks integration to refer to this field.
- **Options**: Provide selectable options for a field.
- **Required**: Indicate whether a field is optional or required for completion.
- **Default value**: Pre-fill the field with a default value, which can be a variable in the cases of short-text and long text fields that don't use the rich text option.

Remember, incomplete form fields can easily be spotted and addressed in completed tasks.
