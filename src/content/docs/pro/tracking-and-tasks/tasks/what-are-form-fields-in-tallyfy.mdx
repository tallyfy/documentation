## What form field types are available in Tallyfy?

Tallyfy form fields are how smart processes ask for user input. This user input can then modify the flow based on what users enter or select. You can add form fields to the **Kick-off Form** (filled before the process starts) or to individual tasks throughout the process. This creates intelligent workflows that adapt based on user responses.

:::tip[Form fields create variables]
Remember that user input collected through these fields becomes data that smart processes use to modify their flow via [variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/) and [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/).
:::

Here are the different types of form fields you can use to ask for user input.

:::note[Required vs. optional]
You can mark most fields as required (must be filled) or optional. Smart processes can use either type to modify their flow. Checklists use validation rules instead.
:::

:::note[Guidance text]
All field types allow adding extra help text (Guidance Text) below the label to guide users on what input the smart process needs.
:::

### How do different field types work?

#### Short text
*   Single line for short user input (up to 200 characters).
*   Smart processes can use this input to modify flow (e.g., different paths for different company names).
*   **Options**: Enforce validation (e.g., must be number, email, URL), min/max length, prefix/suffix (e.g., $, kg).
*   **Tip**: Use short text fields to store [file request links](mdc:products/pro/integrations/document-management/file-request-links/) from your document management system for secure external file collection.

#### Long text
*   Larger box for detailed user input (up to 6,000 characters).
*   **Options**: Enable rich text formatting (bold, lists).
*   Use for collecting descriptions, notes, or feedback that can influence how the process flows.

:::tip[Rich text copy/paste behavior]
**When pasting from Microsoft Word or other applications**, formatting is intentionally stripped to prevent non-compliant HTML. After pasting, use the formatting toolbar to reapply styles.

**Preserving complex formatting**:
- **Option 1**: Use "Show HTML" toggle to paste raw HTML (ensure proper formatting)
- **Option 2**: Use an online HTML editor, then copy clean HTML into Tallyfy
- **Option 3**: Set up [global branding CSS](/products/pro/settings/org-settings/how-can-i-personalize-my-tallyfy-branding-and-emails/) for consistent styling

This behavior prevents broken layouts and ensures content displays correctly across all devices.
:::

#### Dropdown list
*   Asks users to pick **one** option from a list - smart processes often modify their flow based on this selection.
*   **Options**: Define list items, set default.
*   Perfect for when user input should trigger different workflow paths (e.g., select department determines approvers).
*   **Important**: When reordering dropdown options in the template editor, click the save button explicitly. Changes won't persist if you navigate away without saving - refreshing the page will lose your reordering.

#### Checklist
*   Lets users check **one or more** items - smart processes can modify flow based on what's checked.
*   **Options**: Define list items, set defaults, validation (require 'at least one' or 'all items').
*   Use for requirements lists where checked items determine next steps. See [Create Subtasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-create-and-use-subtasks/).
    ![Checklist Field](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-checklist-field.png)

#### Radio buttons
*   Asks users to pick **only one** option - ideal for smart processes that branch based on user choice.
*   **Options**: Define list items, set default.
*   Perfect for Yes/No decisions or priority levels that modify how the process flows.

#### Date
*   Lets users pick a date (and optionally time) from a calendar.
*   **Options**: Set default date (e.g., today, today + 7 days).
*   Use for deadlines (when work should be complete), start dates (when work should begin), meeting dates, and other date-based information.
    ![Date and Time Field](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-datetime-field.png)

#### File upload
*   Lets users upload file(s) (up to 100MB each[^2]).
*   **Options**: Set as required.
*   Use for collecting docs, images, reports.
*   **Alternative**: For sensitive documents or larger files, consider using [file request links](mdc:products/pro/integrations/document-management/file-request-links/) from your existing document management system instead.
*   **Multiple files**: Click and select multiple files at once, or add files one by one - the field supports multiple uploads

#### Table
*   Create a table with columns you define. Users add rows of data.
*   **Options**: Define column headers. No default content.
*   Use for collecting structured lists (e.g., order line items, attendee lists).
*   **Adding Columns**: When setting up the field in the template editor, click **Add New Column** to define the structure.
*   **Using in Tasks**: When the task is active, users click **Add Row** to enter data into the table you defined.
*   **Using with Variables**: You can insert the entire table's data into a later step description using the [Insert Variable](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/how-can-i-use-insert-variables-in-tallyfy/) feature.
*   **Using in Rules**: You can create [automation rules](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) that check if a specific column within the table **Contains** a certain value.

#### Assignee picker
*   Lets user select a Tallyfy member or group.
*   **Options**: Set as required.
*   Use when the person doing a later task needs to be chosen during the process.
    ![Assignee Picker Field](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-assignee-picker.png)

:::important[Assignee picker captures data but doesn't auto-assign]
**The assignee picker field captures who was selected but does NOT automatically reassign tasks.**

To actually use the selected assignee, you must create an automation rule:
1. Add the assignee picker field to your step
2. Go to **Automations** in your template
3. Create a rule with:
   - **IF condition**: When the step with assignee picker is completed
   - **THEN action**: Assign/unassign specific tasks
   - Use the assignee picker field value to determine assignment

**Common use case**: Manager selects team member in Step 1 using assignee picker → Automation assigns Step 2 to that selected person.

Without the automation rule, the selection is just stored data - it won't change any task assignments.
:::

### Form field limitations

:::note[Calculations not supported]
**Tallyfy form fields don't support automatic calculations** like formulas (e.g., Unit Price × Quantity = Total). 

**Workarounds for calculations**:
1. **External calculation** - Have users calculate values externally and enter the result
2. **Instructions in guidance text** - Provide calculation instructions in the field's guidance text
3. **Use automation rules** - Create conditional logic based on entered values to route to different steps
4. **Integration with calculation tools** - Use webhooks or API to send data to external calculation services
5. **Multiple fields** - Collect components separately (price, quantity) and calculate in reporting

For complex calculations, consider integrating with spreadsheet tools via Zapier or using the API to process data externally.
:::

:::tip[Deleting form fields with rule dependencies]
**Can't delete a form field?** If a field is referenced in automation rules in other steps, you must delete those rules first. To troubleshoot:
1. Check all automation rules in your template
2. Look for any rules that reference the field you want to delete
3. Delete or modify those rules first
4. Then delete the form field

This prevents broken automations from fields that no longer exist.
:::

### What other field settings are available?

Most fields also have these settings available when setting them up:

*   **Name**: Field label (the question your smart process asks).
*   **Guidance**: Optional help text below the label to clarify what input will modify the flow. Add this in the **Advanced** section of the field settings within the template editor. It appears in italics below the field name when the task is active, and any URLs included become clickable links.
*   **Field Alias[^1]**: Unique internal ID for integrations and automations that modify flow based on user input. It is automatically generated based on the *first* name you give the field and **does not change** even if you edit the field name later. This ensures that automations using the alias continue to work.
*   **Required**: Mark if this user input is required before task completion.
*   **Default Value**: Set default value (can use variables for text fields). See [Set default content for form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-set-default-content-for-form-fields/) for detailed instructions.

Remember, user input from form fields enables smart processes to ask questions and modify their flow based on responses, ensuring every workflow adapts to specific situations.
