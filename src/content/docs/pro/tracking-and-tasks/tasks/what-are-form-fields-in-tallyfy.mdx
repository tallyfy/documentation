## Overview of Available Form Field Types

[Form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) are how you collect specific information within Tallyfy [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/). You can add them either to the **Kick-off Form** (filled out before the process starts) or to **individual steps/tasks** within the process.

:::tip[Form Fields Create Variables]
Remember that the data entered into these form fields is often what you'll use later in the process via [variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/).
:::

This article describes the different types of form fields you can use.

:::note[Required vs. Optional]
You can mark most fields as required (must be filled out) or optional. Checklists have their own completion rules instead.
:::

:::note[Guidance Text]
All field types let you add extra help text (Guidance Text) that appears below the field label to give users more instructions.
