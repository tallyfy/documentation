## How can I send email reminders in Tallyfy?

To send an email reminder in Tallyfy, click the menu icon (...) next to any task and select **Send Email Reminder** - it instantly notifies all assignees. Simple as that.

While Tallyfy automatically sends reminder emails based on each user's notification preferences, sometimes you need to nudge people right now. Maybe there's an urgent deadline. Or someone's stuck and needs a gentle push. That's where manual reminders come in handy.

### How do I send manual email reminders for tasks?

<Steps>
1. First, track down the task that needs a reminder. You'll find it in the Tasks view or Tracker view.
2. Click the menu icon (...) next to the task name.
3. Select **Send Email Reminder** from the menu.

### What should I know about manual email reminders?

Here's the thing about manual reminders:

*   They fire off immediately - no delay
*   Everyone assigned gets the email (both [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) and [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/))
*   These bypass personal notification settings - yes, even if someone turned off daily reminders
*   Go easy on the reminders. Nobody likes being nagged
