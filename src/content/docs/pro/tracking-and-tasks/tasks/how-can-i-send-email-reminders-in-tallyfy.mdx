## How can I send email reminders in Tallyfy?

Tallyfy provides automatic reminder emails based on individual user notification settings, but situations may require immediate manual reminders for specific [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/).

Manual email reminders prove particularly valuable for urgent tasks requiring immediate attention or when standard automatic reminder schedules don't align with specific deadline requirements.

### How do I send manual email reminders for tasks?

<Steps>
1. Find the task you want to remind assignees about (e.g., in the Tasks view or Tracker view).
2. Click the menu icon (...) next to the task name.
3. Choose **Send Email Reminder** from the menu.

4. Tallyfy will immediately send a reminder email to everyone assigned the task.
The email looks like this:

### What should I know about manual email reminders?

*   This sends the reminder immediately.
*   It goes to *all* current assignees (both [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) and [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/)).
*   It ignores users' personal notification settings (they get this email even if they turned off daily reminders).
*   Use this feature thoughtfully; avoid overusing manual reminders.

To adjust *automatic* reminder settings, see [Manage Email Notifications](/products/pro/settings/personal-settings/how-can-i-manage-email-notifications-in-tallyfy/).
