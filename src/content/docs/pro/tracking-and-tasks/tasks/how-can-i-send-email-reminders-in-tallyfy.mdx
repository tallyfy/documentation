## How to send Email Reminders to co-workers

While Tallyfy automatically sends scheduled email reminders based on users' notification settings, you can also manually send reminders at any time. This is particularly useful for urgent tasks or when you need immediate attention on a specific item.

### Sending manual ad-hoc reminders

If you have a deadline approaching or a forgetful team member, sending email reminders is a simple way to stay on track! Follow these steps:

1. Find the task in your active process.
2. Click on the â‹® next to it and select _Send Email Reminder_.

3. The email will be sent out and it will look something like this:

### Important notes about email reminders

- Manual reminders are sent immediately to all assignees of the selected task
- This feature complements the automatic reminder system, which sends digests based on each user's preferences
- All members and guests receive the manual reminders regardless of their notification schedules
- There is no limit to how many manual reminders you can send, but consider using them judiciously to avoid notification fatigue

For managing automatic email reminder preferences, check your [notification settings](/products/pro/settings/personal-settings/how-can-i-manage-email-notifications-in-tallyfy/).
