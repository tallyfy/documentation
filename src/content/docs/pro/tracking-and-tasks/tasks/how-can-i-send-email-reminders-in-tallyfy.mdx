## How to send manual email reminders for tasks

Tallyfy sends automatic reminder emails based on each user's settings. However, sometimes you might want to send an *extra, immediate* reminder for a specific [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), especially if it's urgent.

### Sending a manual reminder

<Steps>
1. Find the task you want to send a reminder for (e.g., in the Tasks view or Tracker view).
2. Click the menu icon (three dots â‹®) next to the task name.
3. Choose **Send Email Reminder** from the menu.

4. Tallyfy will immediately send a reminder email to everyone currently assigned to that task.
The email looks similar to this:

</Steps>

### Important things to know

*   This sends the reminder right away.
*   It goes to *all* current assignees (both [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) and [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/)).
*   It overrides the users' personal notification settings (they get this email even if they turned off daily reminders).
*   Use this feature when needed, but avoid sending too many manual reminders.

To adjust your *automatic* reminder schedule, see [Manage Email Notifications](/products/pro/settings/personal-settings/how-can-i-manage-email-notifications-in-tallyfy/).
