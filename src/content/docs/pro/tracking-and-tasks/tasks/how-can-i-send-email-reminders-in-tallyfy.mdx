## Send email reminders

Click the menu icon (**...**) next to any active task and select **Send Email Reminder** to instantly notify all assignees. Tallyfy sends the email to every assigned [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) and [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) - except you (the sender).

Sometimes Tallyfy's automatic reminders aren't enough. Urgent deadline? Someone stuck? A manual reminder gives people a direct nudge.

### How to send a manual email reminder

<Steps>
1. Find the task in your Tasks view or Tracker view. The task must be active - you can't send reminders for completed or auto-skipped tasks.
2. Click the menu icon (**...**) next to the task name.
3. Select **Send Email Reminder** from the menu.

4. Tallyfy immediately sends a reminder email to all other assignees. Here's what the email looks like:

</Steps>

### Key details about manual reminders

*   They're sent immediately - no delay
*   All assigned members and guests receive the email, except the person who triggered the reminder
*   These bypass daily digest and reminder frequency settings - but won't reach members who've turned off all emails entirely
*   This works for both process tasks and standalone (one-off) tasks
*   Don't overdo it. Nobody likes being nagged

To adjust your automatic reminder settings, see [Manage email notifications](/products/pro/settings/personal-settings/how-can-i-manage-email-notifications-in-tallyfy/).
