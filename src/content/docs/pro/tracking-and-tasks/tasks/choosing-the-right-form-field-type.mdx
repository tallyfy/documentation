## Selecting the best form field for your workflow

Choosing the right field type isn't just about what data you want to collect - it's about what that data represents and how users will interact with it. The wrong choice can confuse users or create meaningless data that doesn't help your workflow.

### Quick decision guide

| What you need | Best field type | Why |
|---------------|-----------------|-----|
| User picks ONE from a short list (2-5 options) | **Radio buttons** | All options visible, fastest selection |
| User picks ONE from a longer list (6+ options) | **Dropdown** | Saves space, searchable |
| User confirms multiple items were done | **Checklist** | Multi-select with validation options |
| Simple yes/no confirmation | **Radio buttons** | Two clear options, no ambiguity |
| User enters a specific date | **Date** | Calendar picker prevents format errors |
| User needs to explain something | **Long text** | Room for detailed responses |
| User enters brief data (name, number) | **Short text** | Single line with optional validation |
| User must upload evidence | **File upload** | Supports multiple files up to 100MB each |
| User selects who should do something | **Assignee picker** | Integrates with Tallyfy members |
| User enters structured data rows | **Table** | Defined columns, unlimited rows |

### When NOT to use a checklist

Checklists require a minimum of 2 items because a single-item checklist isn't a choice - it's just confirmation. If you have only one thing to verify, use a different approach.

**Single-item scenarios - better alternatives:**

| Instead of this | Use this | Example |
|-----------------|----------|---------|
| Checklist with 1 item | **Yes/No radio buttons** | "Has payment been received?" with Yes/No options |
| Single-option dropdown | **Yes/No radio buttons** | "Approved?" with Yes/No options |
| Checkbox for confirmation | **Radio buttons + conditional fields** | See payment example below |

**The payment confirmation example:**

Bad approach: A dropdown with only "Yes" as an option for "Payment received?"

Good approach:
1. **Radio buttons**: "Has payment been received?" → Yes / No
2. **Conditional date field** (shown if Yes): "Date payment appeared in bank account"
3. **Optional file upload**: "Upload proof of payment (bank statement)"

This provides actual proof of work - not just a meaningless single-item selection.

### When to use checklists

Checklists work best for multi-item verification where:

- Users need to confirm they completed several related items
- The order of completion doesn't matter
- Some or all items may apply depending on the situation

**Good checklist examples:**

- **Quality check**: "Verified formatting", "Checked for errors", "Confirmed accuracy", "Reviewed by second person"
- **Equipment handover**: "Laptop returned", "Badge collected", "Keys returned", "Parking pass collected"
- **Approval criteria**: "Budget approved", "Legal reviewed", "Manager signed off", "IT security cleared"

**Checklist validation options:**

You can require:
- At least one item checked
- All items checked
- No validation (purely informational)

### When to use radio buttons vs dropdown

Both let users pick ONE option. The difference is how options display.

**Use radio buttons when:**
- You have 2-5 options (all fit on screen)
- Users need to see all choices at once
- Decisions are mutually exclusive and clear

**Use dropdown when:**
- You have 6+ options
- Screen space is limited
- Options are self-explanatory (users don't need to compare)

**Pro tip**: For yes/no questions, always use radio buttons - never a dropdown with two options. Radio buttons make the binary choice immediately clear.

### Field type and automation rules

Your field choice affects what [automation rules](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) you can create:

| Field type | Can trigger rules based on | Example rule |
|------------|---------------------------|--------------|
| Radio buttons | Exact selection | If "Priority" = "High" then assign to Manager |
| Dropdown | Exact selection | If "Department" = "Finance" then show finance steps |
| Checklist | Contains specific item | If "Requirements" contains "Legal Review" then show legal step |
| Short text | Contains, equals, is empty | If "Country" contains "USA" then show US compliance step |
| Date | Before/after dates | If "Start Date" is before today then show warning |

Choose fields that support the automation rules your workflow needs.

### Common mistakes to avoid

1. **Using dropdown for binary choices** - Use radio buttons instead; dropdowns add unnecessary clicks for yes/no decisions

2. **Single-item checklists** - These don't work and aren't useful; use radio buttons or conditional fields

3. **Long text for structured data** - If you need specific pieces of information, use separate short text fields or a table

4. **File upload for small confirmations** - Don't require file uploads when a simple confirmation would suffice; it creates friction

5. **Missing validation** - If a field must be filled, mark it required; if text must be an email, enable email validation
