## Which form field should you use?

The right field type depends on what the data represents and how people will interact with it. A wrong choice creates confusion or meaningless data.

### Quick decision guide

| What you need | Best field type | Why |
|---------------|-----------------|-----|
| Pick ONE from 2-5 options | **Radio buttons** | All options visible at once |
| Pick ONE from 6+ options | **Dropdown** | Saves space, searchable |
| Confirm multiple items done | **Checklist** | Multi-select with validation |
| Yes/no confirmation | **Radio buttons** | Two clear, unambiguous options |
| A specific date | **Date** | Calendar picker prevents format errors |
| A detailed explanation | **Long text** | Room for multi-line responses |
| Brief data (name, number) | **Short text** | Single line, optional validation |
| Upload evidence/files | **File upload** | Multiple files, up to 100MB each |
| Select a person | **Assignee picker** | Pulls from Tallyfy members, groups, and guests |
| Structured data rows | **Table** | Defined columns, unlimited rows |

### When NOT to use a checklist

A single-item checklist isn't a real choice - it's just confirmation. Use a different approach when you only have one thing to verify.

| Instead of this | Use this | Example |
|-----------------|----------|---------|
| Checklist with 1 item | **Yes/No radio buttons** | "Has payment been received?" |
| Single-option dropdown | **Yes/No radio buttons** | "Approved?" with Yes/No |
| Checkbox for confirmation | **Radio buttons + conditional fields** | See example below |

**Better pattern - payment confirmation:**

1. **Radio buttons**: "Has payment been received?" - Yes / No
2. **Conditional date field** (shown if Yes): "Date payment appeared in bank account"
3. **Optional file upload**: "Upload proof of payment (bank statement)"

This captures actual proof - not just a meaningless single selection.

### When to use checklists

Checklists shine for multi-item verification:

- Confirming several related items were completed
- Order of completion doesn't matter
- Some or all items may apply

**Good examples:**

- **Quality check**: "Verified formatting", "Checked for errors", "Confirmed accuracy", "Reviewed by second person"
- **Equipment handover**: "Laptop returned", "Badge collected", "Keys returned", "Parking pass collected"
- **Approval criteria**: "Budget approved", "Legal reviewed", "Manager signed off", "IT security cleared"

**Validation options:**

- At least one item checked (mark field as required)
- All items checked (enable the "must all be checked" setting)
- No validation (purely informational)

### Radio buttons vs dropdown

Both let you pick ONE option. The difference is display.

**Radio buttons** - best for 2-5 options where you want all choices visible at once. Radio fields require at least 2 options.

**Dropdown** - best for 6+ options, or when screen space is tight and options are self-explanatory.

For yes/no questions, always use radio buttons. A two-item dropdown just adds an unnecessary click.

### Field types and automation rules

Your field choice affects what [automation rules](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) you can build:

| Field type | Available rule conditions | Example |
|------------|--------------------------|---------|
| Radio buttons | Equals, not equals, contains, is empty | If "Priority" = "High" then assign to Manager |
| Dropdown | Equals, not equals, contains, is empty | If "Department" = "Finance" then show finance steps |
| Checklist | Contains, not contains, equals, is empty | If "Requirements" contains "Legal Review" then show legal step |
| Short text | Contains, equals, greater/less than, is empty | If "Country" contains "USA" then show US compliance step |
| Date | Equals, greater/less than, is empty | If "Start Date" is past today then show warning |

### Common mistakes

1. **Dropdown for binary choices** - Use radio buttons. Dropdowns add an unnecessary click for yes/no decisions.

2. **Single-item checklists** - Not useful. Use radio buttons or conditional fields instead.

3. **Long text for structured data** - Use separate short text fields or a table when you need specific pieces of information.

4. **File upload for simple confirmations** - Don't require uploads when a radio button would do. It creates friction.

5. **Missing validation** - Mark required fields as required. Enable email validation on text fields that collect email addresses.
