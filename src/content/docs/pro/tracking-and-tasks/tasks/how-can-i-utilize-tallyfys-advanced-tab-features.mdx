## How to use Advanced task options in templates

The Advanced tab in Tallyfy provides customization options for [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). This article explains the various features available.

### Launch another process

With Tallyfy, you can launch a new [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) using another [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) once you complete a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/). Simply turn on the "Launch another process when this task is complete" option.

### All assignees must complete

This feature ensures that every assigned [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) or [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) completes a task before the process can move forward.

### Assign launcher automatically

The "Assign launcher automatically" setting controls whether the person who launches the [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) should be automatically assigned to [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) that have no assignees.

#### When "Assign launcher automatically" is ON

- If members/groups are assigned in the template, they will be the only assignees after launch
- If no one is assigned to a step, the process launcher will be automatically assigned
- If only guest users are assigned, the process launcher will be assigned along with the guest users

#### When "Assign launcher automatically" is OFF

- If members/groups are assigned in the template, they will be the only assignees after launch
- If no one is assigned to a step, the task will remain unassigned (nobody assigned)
- If only guest users are assigned, only the guest users will be assigned to the task

This setting gives you flexibility to create [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) with tasks that can be intentionally left unassigned until someone decides to take ownership of them.

### Mandatory tasks

You can mark [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) as mandatory, ensuring they cannot be removed at the start of the process.

### Locked tasks

This feature allows you to restrict [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) access to only assigned members, ensuring that only those who need access have it.

To prevent other members from being able to approve/reject or complete a task:

<Steps>
1. In the template editor, click on your task
2. Select the **Advanced** tab
3. Enable the toggle for **"Only assigned members can complete or edit this task"**
</Steps>

![Only assigned setting](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-only-assigned-can-complete.png)

When this setting is enabled, only the specifically assigned [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) will be able to complete, approve, reject, or edit the task. This restriction works for all task types, including approve/reject [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/).

Please note: This restriction does not apply to users with the Administrator [role](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-do-i-manage-member-permissions-in-tallyfy/). Administrators always maintain full access to edit and complete all [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) regardless of this setting.

### Webhook integration

Want to integrate Tallyfy with other apps? The [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) feature allows you to emit a webhook when a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) is completed. Connect Tallyfy to your favorite tools and automate your workflow.

### Guest-friendly tasks

Have [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) involved in your workflows? You can prevent them from making or seeing comments for any [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/). Keep things streamlined and focused.

### Unique step alias

When using [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/), a unique step alias is used to identify each step. This helps you track progress and makes your automation even more powerful.
