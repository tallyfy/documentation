## What is the advanced tab in a task

The Advanced tab in Tallyfy provides customization options for templates. This article explains the various features available.

## Launch Another Process

With Tallyfy, you can launch a new process using another template once you complete a task. Simply turn on the "Launch another process when this task is complete" option.

## All Assignees Must Complete

This feature ensures that every assigned member or guest completes a task before the process can move forward.

## Assign Launcher Automatically

The "Assign launcher automatically" setting controls whether the person who launches the process should be automatically assigned to tasks that have no assignees.

### When "Assign launcher automatically" is ON:

- If members/groups are assigned in the template, they will be the only assignees after launch
- If no one is assigned to a step, the process launcher will be automatically assigned
- If only guest users are assigned, the process launcher will be assigned along with the guest users

### When "Assign launcher automatically" is OFF:

- If members/groups are assigned in the template, they will be the only assignees after launch
- If no one is assigned to a step, the task will remain unassigned (nobody assigned)
- If only guest users are assigned, only the guest users will be assigned to the task

This setting gives you flexibility to create templates with tasks that can be intentionally left unassigned until someone decides to take ownership of them.

## Mandatory Tasks

You can mark tasks as mandatory, ensuring they cannot be removed at the start of the process.

## Locked Tasks

This feature allows you to restrict task access to only assigned members, ensuring that only those who need access have it.

To prevent other members from being able to approve/reject or complete a task:

1. In the template editor, click on your task
2. Select the **Advanced** tab
3. Enable the toggle for **"Only assigned members can complete or edit this task"**

When this setting is enabled, only the specifically assigned members will be able to complete, approve, reject, or edit the task. This restriction works for all task types, including approve/reject tasks.

Please note: This restriction does not apply to users with the Administrator role. Administrators always maintain full access to edit and complete all tasks regardless of this setting.

## Webhook Integration

Want to integrate Tallyfy with other apps? The webhooks feature allows you to emit a webhook when a task is completed. Connect Tallyfy to your favorite tools and automate your workflow.

## Guest-Friendly Tasks

Have guests involved in your workflows? You can prevent them from making or seeing comments for any task. Keep things streamlined and focused.

## Unique Step Alias

When using webhooks, a unique step alias is used to identify each step. This helps you track progress and makes your automation even more powerful.

That's it for the Advanced tab in Tallyfy! Take advantage of these features to supercharge your workflows.
