## How can I use advanced task options in templates?

The **Advanced** tab in your [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) step editor gives you powerful control over how tasks behave when processes run. You'll find these settings when editing any step - they're what turn basic workflows into smart, automated systems.

Let's walk through each option:

*   **Launch another process when this task is complete**: Want to trigger another workflow automatically? Switch this **ON**. When someone completes this task, Tallyfy will kick off a different process from another template. You can launch it separately or inject its tasks right into your current process - think of it as nesting one template inside another at runtime. (Currently, variables don't pass between processes, but that's coming soon.) See [Launch another process guide](/products/pro/launching/launch-process-when-task-is-completed/).

*   **All assignees must complete this task**: Turn this **ON** when you need everyone's individual sign-off. The task won't move forward until every single assignee marks it complete. You'll see a counter like "1 of 3 completed" tracking progress.

    Here's what happens when you enable this:
    * A **lock icon** shows up next to assignees - only they can complete the task
    * Everyone sees a **completion counter** ("2 of 4 completed") so they know where things stand
    * Tallyfy posts an **automated comment** each time someone completes their part
    * The task stays open until the last person finishes
    * Guests can participate too - they'll see the counter and complete their portion just like members
    
    *Heads up: This only works with regular "Task" steps right now, not "Approve/Reject" steps.*

*   **Assign launcher automatically**: What if nobody's assigned to a step? This setting decides.
    *   **ON**: The person who launches the process gets the task automatically
    *   **OFF**: The task sits unassigned until someone claims it or gets assigned
    
    :::warning[Group assignment behavior]
    Got a group assigned to this step? Careful - if "Assign launcher automatically" is ON, the launcher becomes an **extra** assignee on top of the group. Both the group AND the launcher can work on the task. Don't want that? Turn this setting OFF for group-assigned steps.
    :::

*   **Task is mandatory...**: Used to prevent tasks from being removed at launch. 
    :::note[Deprecated Setting]
    You'll still see this option, but it's deprecated. We kept it around for older templates that rely on it.
    :::

*   **Only assigned members can complete or edit this task**: Lock this task down. When **ON**, only assigned people can touch it - no one else can complete or edit it. Perfect for sensitive tasks or when you need strict control. (Admins can still edit everything though.)
    :::note[Admin override]
    Administrators bypass this restriction - they can always edit tasks.

*   **Emit webhook when completed**: Need to notify another system? Switch **ON** to fire a [webhook](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) when this task gets done. Great for updating CRMs or triggering external workflows.

*   **Prevent guests from making or seeing comments**: Keep guest conversations limited. When **ON**, [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) can't see or add comments on this task. They can still complete it - they just can't chat about it.
    :::note
    You can still hide individual comments from guests even when this is **OFF**.
    :::

*   **Unique Step Alias**: This gives your step a permanent ID that never changes. You'll need this for API [integrations](/products/pro/integrations/) or webhooks - it's how external systems can reliably reference this specific step.

*   **Tags**: Label individual tasks for easy filtering. These task-level tags are separate from process tags. Super handy when you want to slice and dice your task views - filter by "urgent", "finance", or whatever categories make sense for your workflow.
