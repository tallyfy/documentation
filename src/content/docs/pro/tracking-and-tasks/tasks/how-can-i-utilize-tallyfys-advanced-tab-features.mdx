## Using Advanced Task Options in Templates

When editing a step in a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), the **Advanced** tab offers several options to control how that task behaves when the process runs.

Here's a breakdown of these options:

*   **Launch another process when this task is complete**: Turn this ON to automatically start a different process (from another template) when this task is finished. See [Launch another process guide](/products/pro/launching/launch-process-when-task-is-completed/).

*   **All assignees must complete this task**: If ON, the task isn't considered done until *everyone* assigned to it marks it complete.

*   **Assign launcher automatically**: Controls what happens if you don't assign anyone to this step in the template.
    *   If ON: The person who starts the process will be automatically assigned to this task.
    *   If OFF: The task will start as "Unassigned", and someone will need to be assigned later (or take it).

*   **Task is mandatory...**: If ON, this task cannot be removed from the process when it is launched.

*   **Only assigned members can complete or edit this task**: If ON, only the people specifically assigned to this task can complete it or edit its details. (Note: Administrators can always edit any task).

*   **Emit webhook when completed**: Turn ON to send an automatic notification (a [webhook](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/)) to another system when this task is completed.

*   **Prevent guests from making or seeing comments**: If ON, any [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) assigned to this task will not be able to see or add comments.

*   **Unique Step Alias**: This is a fixed, unique ID for this specific step *within this template*. It's mainly used for technical [integrations](/products/pro/integrations/) via the API or webhooks.
