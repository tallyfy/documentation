## Use advanced task options in templates

The **Advanced** tab in your [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) step editor controls how tasks behave when processes run. You'll find these settings when editing any step.

Here's each option:

*   **Launch another process when this task is complete**: Switch **ON** to automatically start a different process from another template when someone completes this task. You can launch it as a separate process or inject its tasks into your current process. See the [Launch another process guide](/products/pro/launching/launch-process-when-task-is-completed/).

*   **All assignees must complete this task**: Turn **ON** when you need every assignee's individual sign-off. The task won't move forward until everyone marks it complete.

    When enabled:
    * A **lock icon** appears next to assignees - only they can complete the task
    * A **completion counter** ("2 of 4 completed") tracks progress
    * Tallyfy posts an **automated comment** each time someone completes their part
    * The task stays open until the last person finishes
    * Guests can participate too - they'll see the counter and complete their portion like members

    *This works with Task and Approve/Reject steps, but not with Expiring or Email steps.*

*   **Assign launcher automatically**: Controls what happens when nobody's assigned to a step.
    *   **ON**: The person who launches the process gets the task automatically
    *   **OFF**: The task stays unassigned until someone claims it or gets assigned

    :::warning[Group assignment behavior]
    If a group is assigned to this step and "Assign launcher automatically" is ON, the launcher becomes an **extra** assignee on top of the group. Both the group AND the launcher can work on the task. Turn this OFF for group-assigned steps if you don't want that.
    :::

*   **Task is mandatory**: Prevents tasks from being removed at launch.
    :::note[Deprecated setting]
    This option still appears but it's deprecated. It's kept for older templates that rely on it.
    :::

*   **Only assigned members can complete or edit this task**: When **ON**, only assigned people can complete or edit this task. Good for sensitive tasks where you need strict control.
    :::note[Admin override]
    Admins bypass this restriction - they can always edit tasks.

*   **Emit webhook when completed**: Switch **ON** to fire a [webhook](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) when this task is completed. Useful for notifying external systems like CRMs.

*   **Prevent guests from making or seeing comments**: When **ON**, [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) can't see or add comments on this task. They can still complete it.
    :::note
    You can hide individual comments from guests even when this is **OFF**.
    :::

*   **Unique step alias**: A permanent ID for your step that never changes. You'll need this for API [integrations](/products/pro/integrations/) or webhooks - it's how external systems reliably reference this specific step.

*   **Tags**: Label individual tasks for filtering. These step-level tags are separate from process tags. Filter your task views by categories like "urgent", "finance", or whatever makes sense for your workflow.
