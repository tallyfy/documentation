## How can I use advanced task options in templates?

When editing a step in a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), the **Advanced** tab offers options to control how the task works when the process runs. These advanced settings provide sophisticated workflow control and automation capabilities.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Launch another process when this task is complete**: Switch **ON** to automatically start a different process (from another template) when this task is finished. This can launch the new process either separately or add its tasks within the current one. Currently, variables and data from the current process are not passed to the new process, but this functionality is planned for a future update. See [Launch another process guide](/products/pro/launching/launch-process-when-task-is-completed/).

*   **All assignees must complete this task**: If **ON**, the task isn't done until *everyone* assigned completes it individually. A counter (e.g., "1 of 3 completed") will show progress. This setting automatically enables "Only assigned members can complete...". 

    When this setting is enabled:
    * A **lock icon** appears next to assignees in the active process, indicating only they can complete the task.
    * All assignees will see a **completion counter** (e.g., "2 of 4 completed") showing how many people have marked it complete so far.
    * When an assignee completes the task, the system posts an **automated comment** noting their completion.
    * The task is only marked complete in the overall process once all assignees have individually completed it.
    * Guests assigned to the task will also see the completion counter and can mark their part complete.
    
    *Note: This setting currently only applies to the standard "Task" step type, not "Approve/Reject" steps.*

*   **Assign launcher automatically**: Controls what happens if no one is assigned to this step in the template.
    *   If **ON**: The process launcher is automatically assigned to this task.
    *   If **OFF**: The task starts as "Unassigned", and someone must be assigned later (or take it).

*   **Task is mandatory...**: If **ON**, this task cannot be removed when the process is launched.
    :::note[Deprecated Setting]
    This setting is deprecated. It was originally used to ensure that a task could not be turned off or removed when a process was launched.
    :::

*   **Only assigned members can complete or edit this task**: If **ON**, only people assigned to this task can complete it or edit details. This is a strong permission setting that helps protect tasks from being completed or edited by non-assignees. (Note: Admins can always edit tasks).
    :::note[Admin override]
    Administrators can always edit tasks, regardless of this setting.

*   **Emit webhook when completed**: Switch **ON** to send an automatic notification (a [webhook](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/)) to another system when this task is completed.

*   **Prevent guests from making or seeing comments**: If **ON**, any [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) assigned cannot see or add comments to this task.
    :::note
    Even if this setting is **OFF**, you can still control the visibility of individual comments.
    :::

*   **Unique Step Alias**: A fixed, unique ID for this step *in this template*. Mainly used for technical [integrations](/products/pro/integrations/) via the API or webhooks.

*   **Tags**: Add specific tags to this individual task. Task tags are different from tags applied to an entire process. You can use filters in your task views to find and organize tasks based on these tags.
