## Using advanced task options in templates

When editing a step in a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), the **Advanced** tab offers options to control how the task works when the process runs.

Here's a breakdown:

*   **Launch another process when this task is complete**: Switch **ON** to automatically start a different process (from another template) when this task is finished. See [Launch another process guide](/products/pro/launching/launch-process-when-task-is-completed/).

*   **All assignees must complete this task**: If **ON**, the task isn't done until *everyone* assigned completes it individually. A counter (e.g., "1 of 3 completed") will show progress. This setting automatically enables "Only assigned members can complete...". 

    When this setting is enabled:
    * A **lock icon** appears next to assignees in the active process, indicating only they can complete the task.
    * All assignees will see a **completion counter** (e.g., "2 of 4 completed") showing how many people have marked it complete so far.
    * When an assignee completes the task, the system posts an **automated comment** noting their completion.
    * The task is only marked complete in the overall process once all assignees have individually completed it.
    * Guests assigned to the task will also see the completion counter and can mark their part complete.
    
    *Note: This setting currently only applies to the standard "Task" step type, not "Approve/Reject" steps.*

*   **Assign launcher automatically**: Controls what happens if no one is assigned to this step in the template.
    *   If **ON**: The process launcher is automatically assigned to this task.
    *   If **OFF**: The task starts as "Unassigned", and someone must be assigned later (or take it).

*   **Task is mandatory...**: If **ON**, this task cannot be removed when the process is launched.

*   **Only assigned members can complete or edit this task**: If **ON**, only people assigned to this task can complete it or edit details. (Note: Admins can always edit tasks).
    :::note[Admin override]
    Administrators can always edit tasks, regardless of this setting.

*   **Emit webhook when completed**: Switch **ON** to send an automatic notification (a [webhook](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/)) to another system when this task is completed.

*   **Prevent guests from making or seeing comments**: If **ON**, any [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) assigned cannot see or add comments to this task.

*   **Unique Step Alias**: A fixed, unique ID for this step *in this template*. Mainly used for technical [integrations](/products/pro/integrations/) via the API or webhooks.
