## Task categories in Tallyfy

Tallyfy supports two distinct task categories:

1. **Process tasks** - Tasks that exist within a process template or instance, providing context and structure to the workflow
2. **One-off tasks** - Standalone ad-hoc tasks created independently of a process

While both task categories can be managed through Tallyfy, the platform is primarily designed for process-based task management, where tasks exist within a defined workflow context.

## Task types and step types

In Tallyfy, the terms "task types" and "step types" are used interchangeably to refer to the same concept. When creating templates, you define "steps" with specific types. When those templates are launched as processes, the steps become "tasks" while maintaining their original type (Task, Approve/Reject, Expiring, Email Draft, or Email Auto-Send).

For a detailed explanation of all available task/step types and their specific use cases, see the [Step types](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-types-of-tasks-can-i-create-with-tallyfy/) article.
