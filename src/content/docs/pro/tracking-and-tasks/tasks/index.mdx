## Understanding tasks in Tallyfy

In Tallyfy, a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) represents a single piece of work. There are two main types of tasks:

### Why understanding tasks is important

Tasks are the fundamental units of work in Tallyfy that drive process completion. Understanding how tasks function is essential because they're what team members interact with daily. Clear, well-designed tasks ensure that work gets done correctly, on time, and by the right people. When everyone understands the different types of tasks and how they work, your processes run more smoothly, with fewer bottlenecks and questions about what needs to be done.

1.  **Process Tasks**: These tasks are part of a workflow defined in a [process template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). They have context and often depend on other steps/tasks within the [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). Most work in Tallyfy uses process tasks.
2.  **One-off Tasks**: These are standalone tasks, like simple to-dos, that are not part of a template. You can create them for single actions.

### Tasks vs. steps

Sometimes you'll see the term 'Step' used, especially in templates. **'Steps'** (in a template) become **'Tasks'** (in a running process).

*   When you build a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), you add 'Steps'. Each has a specific type (like a regular Task step, an Approval step, an Email step, etc.).
*   When you [launch](/products/pro/launching/) that template, those steps become 'Tasks' that people complete. The type stays the same (e.g., a 'Task' step becomes a 'Task' task, an 'Approve/Reject' step becomes an 'Approve/Reject' task).

For details on the different types, see the [Step/Task Types article](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-types-of-tasks-can-i-create-with-tallyfy/).

Now that you understand the basics of tasks in Tallyfy, you'll want to explore the [different types of tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-types-of-tasks-can-i-create-with-tallyfy/) you can create and how to use them effectively. If you need a simple to-do item, learning how to [create a one-off task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-create-a-one-off-task-in-tallyfy/) is a good next step.
