## What are tasks in Tallyfy?

Tasks are the work items your team completes in Tallyfy every day. There are two types.

### Why do tasks matter?

Tasks drive everything in Tallyfy. When your team understands them:

- Everyone knows exactly what to do - no "what's next?" confusion
- Work gets done right, by the right people, at the right time
- AI can help complete tasks automatically with [BYO AI integration](/products/pro/integrations/byo-ai/)

### What timing concepts apply to tasks?

Tallyfy gives you two timing controls:

- **Start time** - when someone should begin working on the task. It's guidance, not enforced
- **Deadline** - the hard stop. Miss this and it shows as overdue

You can set both on templates and one-off tasks. Use [expiring tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-types-of-tasks-can-i-create-with-tallyfy/) for FYI items that auto-complete at deadline - this prevents [task debt](/products/pro/tutorials/how-to/how-to-avoid-task-debt/).

### Two types of tasks

1.  **Process tasks** - these live inside your [process templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), connected to other tasks in a workflow. Perfect for anything you do repeatedly
2.  **One-off tasks** - quick, standalone to-dos. No template needed. Create it, assign it, done

### What's the difference between tasks and steps?

**Steps** live in templates. **Tasks** live in running processes.

When you build a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), you add steps - the blueprint. Each step has a type (task, approval, expiring, email, or expiring email). When you [launch](/products/pro/launching/) that template, those steps become tasks that people complete. The step's type carries over directly - a task step becomes a task, an approval step becomes an approval task.

See all available types in the [step/task types article](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-types-of-tasks-can-i-create-with-tallyfy/).
