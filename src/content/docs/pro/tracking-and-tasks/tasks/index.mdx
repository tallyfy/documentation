## What are tasks in Tallyfy?

Tasks in Tallyfy represent individual pieces of work that need to be completed - they're the building blocks of your Tallyfy workflows.

Tallyfy provides two main types of tasks to handle different workflow needs:

### Why is understanding tasks important for workflow management?

Tasks are the fundamental units of work in Tallyfy that drive process completion and ensure nothing falls through the cracks.

Understanding how tasks function is essential because:
- Tasks are what team members interact with daily
- Clear, well-designed tasks ensure work gets done correctly, on time, and by the right people
- When everyone understands the different types of tasks and how they work, your processes run more smoothly and efficiently

This reduces bottlenecks, eliminates confusion, and keeps work flowing smoothly.

### What timing concepts apply to tasks?

Tasks in Tallyfy can have two types of timing:

- **Start time**: When work should **begin** on the task (provides scheduling guidance but is not enforced)
- **Deadline**: When work should be **complete** on the task (determines if a task becomes overdue)

Both timing elements can be set for tasks within processes (when creating templates) and for one-off tasks (when creating them directly). Understanding this distinction helps teams plan effectively and meet deadlines consistently.

Here's what each task type offers:

1.  **Process Tasks**: These tasks are part of a workflow defined in a [process template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). Process tasks have context and often depend on other steps/tasks within the [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). Most work in Tallyfy uses process tasks for repeatable, standardized workflows
2.  **One-off Tasks**: These are standalone tasks, like simple to-dos, that are not part of a template. You can create one-off tasks for single actions or ad-hoc work that doesn't fit into a standard process

### What is the difference between tasks and steps?

You'll often see the term 'Step' used when working with Tallyfy templates - here's the key distinction:

**'Steps'** (in a template) become **'Tasks'** (in a running process).

*   When you build a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), you add 'Steps'. Each step has a specific type (like a regular Task step, an Approval step, an Email step, and more)
*   When you [launch](/products/pro/launching/) that template, those steps become 'Tasks' that people complete. The step type stays the same (e.g., a 'Task' step becomes a 'Task' task, an 'Approve/Reject' step becomes an 'Approve/Reject' task)

For details on the different types, see the [Step/Task Types article](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-types-of-tasks-can-i-create-with-tallyfy/).
