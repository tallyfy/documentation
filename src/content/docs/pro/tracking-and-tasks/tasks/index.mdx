## Task types in Tallyfy

Tallyfy supports two distinct task categories:

1. **Process tasks** - Tasks that exist within a process template or instance, providing context and structure to the workflow
2. **One-off tasks** - Standalone ad-hoc tasks created independently of a process

While both task types can be managed through Tallyfy, the platform is primarily designed for process-based task management, where tasks exist within a defined workflow context.
