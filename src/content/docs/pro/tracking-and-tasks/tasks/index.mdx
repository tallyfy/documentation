## Task categories in Tallyfy

Tallyfy supports two distinct [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) categories:

1. **Process tasks** - Tasks that exist within a [process template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) or instance, providing context and structure to the workflow
2. **One-off tasks** - Standalone ad-hoc tasks created independently of a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)

While both task categories can be managed through Tallyfy, the platform is primarily designed for process-based task management, where tasks exist within a defined workflow context.

## Task types and step types

In Tallyfy, the terms "task types" and "step types" are used interchangeably to refer to the same concept. When creating [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), you define "steps" with specific types. When those templates are launched as [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), the steps become "tasks" while maintaining their original type (Task, Approve/Reject, Expiring, Email Draft, or Email Auto-Send).

For a detailed explanation of all available task/step types and their specific use cases, see the [Step types](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-types-of-tasks-can-i-create-with-tallyfy/) article.
