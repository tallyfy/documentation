## What are tasks in Tallyfy?

Tasks are the actual work items people complete in Tallyfy - they're what your team interacts with every day. Simple as that.

You've got two types to work with:

### Why is understanding tasks important for workflow management?

Here's the thing - tasks drive everything in Tallyfy. They're how work actually gets done.

When you understand tasks, magic happens:
- Your team knows exactly what to do (no more confusion or "what's next?" questions)
- Work gets done right the first time - by the right people at the right time
- Processes flow smoothly because everyone's on the same page

The result? No bottlenecks. No dropped balls. Just smooth workflows.

### What timing concepts apply to tasks?

Timing matters. Tallyfy gives you two ways to control when things happen:

- **Start time**: When someone should start working on the task (it's guidance, not enforced - think of it as a friendly nudge)
- **Deadline**: The hard stop. When the task must be done. Miss this and it shows as overdue

You can set both timings whether you're creating templates or quick one-off tasks. Get this right and your team hits deadlines like clockwork.

Now, about those task types I mentioned:

1.  **Process Tasks**: These live inside your [process templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) - they're connected to other tasks and follow a specific workflow. This is where 90% of your work happens in Tallyfy. Perfect for anything you do repeatedly
2.  **One-off Tasks**: Quick, standalone to-dos. No template needed. Just create it, assign it, done. Great for those "can you handle this?" moments that pop up

### What is the difference between tasks and steps?

This trips people up, so let's clear it up right now:

**Steps** live in templates. **Tasks** live in running processes.

Think of it this way:
*   When you're building a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), you add Steps - these are the blueprint. Each step has its own type (regular task, approval, email, you name it)
*   When you [launch](/products/pro/launching/) that template? Those steps transform into Tasks that people actually complete. Same types, different context. A Task step becomes a Task task, an Approval step becomes an Approval task

Simple, right? For all the different types you can use, check out the [Step/Task Types article](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-types-of-tasks-can-i-create-with-tallyfy/).

## What should I learn next?

Got the basics down? Great. Here's where to go from here.

First up - dive into the [different types of tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-types-of-tasks-can-i-create-with-tallyfy/) Tallyfy offers. There's more than you might think, and each type solves specific workflow challenges.

Need something done fast? Learn how to [create a one-off task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-create-a-one-off-task-in-tallyfy/). Takes 30 seconds, max.

And when things go sideways (they always do sometimes), you'll want to know how to [report and resolve issues](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-report-and-resolve-issues-in-tallyfy/). Tallyfy's blocker system is a lifesaver for handling roadblocks.
