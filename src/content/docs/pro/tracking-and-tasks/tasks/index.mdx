## Understanding Tasks in Tallyfy

In Tallyfy, a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) represents a single piece of work that needs to be done. There are two main kinds of tasks:

1.  **Process Tasks**: These tasks are part of a larger workflow defined in a [process template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). They have context and often depend on other tasks within the [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). Most work in Tallyfy happens through process tasks.
2.  **One-off Tasks**: These are standalone tasks, like simple to-do items, that are not connected to a larger process template. You can create them quickly for single actions.

### Tasks vs. Steps

Sometimes you'll see the term **Step** used, especially when editing templates. **Steps** (in a template) become **Tasks** (in a running process).

*   When you build a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), you add **Steps**. Each step has a specific type (like a regular Task step, an Approval step, an Email step, etc.).
*   When you [launch](/products/pro/launching/) that template to create a running [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), those steps become **Tasks** that people complete. The type remains the same (e.g., a "Task" step becomes a "Task" task, an "Approve/Reject" step becomes an "Approve/Reject" task).

For details on the different types, see the [Step/Task Types article](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-types-of-tasks-can-i-create-with-tallyfy/).
