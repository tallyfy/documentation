## What are tasks in Tallyfy?

In Tallyfy, a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) represents a single piece of work that needs to be completed.

Tallyfy offers two main types of tasks:

### Why is understanding tasks important for workflow management?

Tasks are the fundamental units of work in Tallyfy that drive process completion.

Understanding how tasks function is essential because:
- Tasks are what team members interact with daily
- Clear, well-designed tasks ensure work gets done correctly, on time, and by the right people
- When everyone understands the different types of tasks and how they work, your processes run more smoothly

This reduces bottlenecks and questions about what needs to be done.

### What timing concepts apply to tasks?

Tasks in Tallyfy can have two types of timing:

- **Start time**: When work should **begin** on the task (provides scheduling guidance but is not enforced)
- **Deadline**: When work should be **complete** on the task (determines if a task becomes overdue)

Both timing elements can be set for tasks within processes (when creating templates) and for one-off tasks (when creating them directly). Understanding this distinction helps with better planning and task management.

Tallyfy offers two main types of tasks:

1.  **Process Tasks**: These tasks are part of a workflow defined in a [process template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). Process tasks have context and often depend on other steps/tasks within the [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). Most work in Tallyfy uses process tasks
2.  **One-off Tasks**: These are standalone tasks, like simple to-dos, that are not part of a template. You can create one-off tasks for single actions

### What is the difference between tasks and steps?

Sometimes you'll see the term 'Step' used, especially in Tallyfy templates.

**'Steps'** (in a template) become **'Tasks'** (in a running process).

*   When you build a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), you add 'Steps'. Each step has a specific type (like a regular Task step, an Approval step, an Email step, etc.)
*   When you [launch](/products/pro/launching/) that template, those steps become 'Tasks' that people complete. The step type stays the same (e.g., a 'Task' step becomes a 'Task' task, an 'Approve/Reject' step becomes an 'Approve/Reject' task)

For details on the different types, see the [Step/Task Types article](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-types-of-tasks-can-i-create-with-tallyfy/).

## What should I learn next?

Now that you understand the basics of tasks in Tallyfy, you'll want to explore the [different types of tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-types-of-tasks-can-i-create-with-tallyfy/) you can create and how to use them effectively.

If you need a simple to-do item, learning how to [create a one-off task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-create-a-one-off-task-in-tallyfy/) is a good next step.
