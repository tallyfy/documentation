## Tasks in Tallyfy

There's two types of tasks on Tallyfy:

1. A one-off task - which just an ad-hoc task
2. A task - which is an ordinary task that's linked to a process.

Because Tallyfy is primarily used to manage recurring processes, a normal task for us is one that's got context - it's linked to a specific process.
