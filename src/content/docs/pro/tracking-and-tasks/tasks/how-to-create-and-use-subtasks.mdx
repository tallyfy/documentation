## How to create and use subtasks in Tallyfy

Breaking complex tasks into smaller, manageable components can significantly improve workflow clarity and execution. In Tallyfy, you can create subtasks within steps using the Checklist form field type, giving you the ability to track incremental progress toward task completion.

## Understanding subtasks in Tallyfy

Subtasks in Tallyfy are implemented as Checklist form fields that:
- Allow task owners to break down complex steps into smaller components
- Provide visual progress tracking as individual items are completed
- Support validation rules to define completion requirements
- Can be pre-checked to indicate default statuses

## Creating subtasks for a step

To add subtasks to a step in your template:

1. Navigate to your template and enter **Edit** mode
2. Select the step where you want to add subtasks
3. Click on the **Form Fields** tab
4. Select **Add field**
5. Name your field (e.g., "Implementation Subtasks")
6. Choose **Checklist** as the field type
7. Add your subtasks in the **Options** section, one per line
8. Configure validation settings (see below)
9. Click **Save**

## Validation options for subtasks

Tallyfy offers two validation options for Checklist fields:

### Require at least one item

This setting considers the subtasks complete when at least one item is checked. This is useful for:
- Optional subtasks where only some items may apply
- Scenarios where multiple approaches exist, but only one is needed
- Giving task owners flexibility in execution

To configure this option:
1. In the field configuration, find the **Validation** section
2. Choose **At least one item required**

### Require all items

This setting requires every subtask to be checked before the field is considered complete. This is ideal for:
- Critical processes where all steps must be followed
- Compliance scenarios requiring comprehensive execution
- Quality control procedures where nothing can be skipped

To configure this option:
1. In the field configuration, find the **Validation** section
2. Choose **All items required**

## Setting default checked states

You can pre-check specific subtasks to indicate default statuses:

1. In the field configuration, find the **Options** section
2. For each subtask that should be pre-checked, select the checkbox next to it
3. Save your changes

Pre-checking items is useful for:
- Tasks where certain subtasks are typically already complete
- Highlighting the remaining work to be done
- Setting default states for common scenarios

## Completing subtasks during process execution

When a process is launched, assignees can check off subtasks as they complete them:

1. Open the assigned task in an active process
2. Locate the Checklist field containing the subtasks
3. Check each subtask as it's completed
4. When the validation requirements are met (all items or at least one), the field is considered complete

## Best practices for using subtasks

- **Keep subtasks clear and specific**: Each subtask should represent a single, unambiguous action
- **Limit the number of subtasks**: Aim for 3-7 subtasks per checklist to maintain clarity
- **Use consistent format**: Start each subtask with an action verb for consistency
- **Order logically**: Arrange subtasks in the sequence they should be performed
- **Choose validation wisely**: Consider the nature of the task when deciding between "at least one" and "all items" validation
- **Include guidance**: Add helpful descriptions in the field guidance to explain what each subtask entails

## Example subtask implementations

### Quality assurance checklist
```
Verify all images load correctly
Check text for spelling errors
Test all links and buttons
Validate form submissions
Ensure mobile responsiveness
```

### Customer onboarding subtasks
```
Send welcome email
Schedule orientation call
Provide access credentials
Set up training session
Collect feedback after first use
```

### Document approval process
```
Review for factual accuracy
Check formatting consistency
Verify all references
Approve language and tone
Confirm legal compliance
```

## Using subtasks for process improvement

Subtasks provide valuable insights for continuous improvement:
- Track which subtasks are frequently skipped (for "at least one" validation)
- Identify subtasks that take longest to complete
- Review subtasks that are most commonly added or modified
- Analyze patterns in subtask completion to refine process steps

By strategically implementing subtasks with Checklist form fields, you can enhance task clarity, improve completion rates, and gain deeper insights into your processes.
