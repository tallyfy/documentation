## How can I use the checklist field to create subtasks?

Sometimes a single step in your process has several smaller actions. You can break down tasks into a list of subtasks using the **Checklist** [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) type. This helps track progress on smaller items within a step. Subtasks provide granular visibility and ensure comprehensive task completion.

### What are checklist subtasks?

When you add a Checklist field to a task:
- You create a list of items related to the parent task.
- Users check off each item as they complete it.
- You set rules for completing the checklist (and potentially the parent task).

### How do I create checklist subtasks in a template?

<Steps>
1. Open your [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in **Edit** mode.
2. Click the step where you want to add the checklist.
3. Go to the **Form Fields** tab in the settings panel (usually right).
4. Click **Add field**.
5. Name the field (e.g., "Preparation Checklist").
6. Choose **Checklist** as the field type.
7. In the **Options** box, type each subtask on its own line.
8. Choose a **Validation** rule (see below).
9. *(Optional)* Pre-check items that should be checked by default. See [Set default content for form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-set-default-content-for-form-fields/) for more details about default selections.
10. Click **Save**.
</Steps>

### How do checklist completion rules work (validation)?

You need to tell Tallyfy when this checklist is considered done:

*   **Require 'at least one' item**: The checklist is done if *at least one* box is checked. Good for optional steps or if only one action is needed.
*   **Require 'all items'**: *Every* box must be checked before the checklist is done. Good when every subtask is critical.

Choose the validation rule that fits your subtasks.

### How do I complete checklist subtasks when running a process?

When working on the task with the checklist:

<Steps>
1. Open the task.
2. The checklist appears in the form fields.
3. Check off items as you complete them.
4. Once you meet the validation rule set (checked 'at least one', or checked 'all items'), you can complete the parent task (assuming all other required fields are filled).
</Steps>

### What are best practices for using checklists as subtasks?

*   **Be clear**: Make each item a clear action.
*   **Keep lists relatively short**: Aim for 3-7 items per checklist if possible.
*   **Use action verbs**: Start each item with a verb (e.g., "Verify ID", "Upload Document").
*   **Order logically**: List items in the order they should be done.
*   **Choose validation carefully**: Decide if *all* items are essential, or just *some*.
*   **Add guidance**: Use the guidance text option to add extra details if needed.

### What are examples of effective checklists?

**QA Check:**
```text
- Check spelling
- Verify links
- Test on mobile
```

**Onboarding:**
```text
- Send welcome pack
- Schedule intro meeting
- Grant system access
```

Using checklists helps break down work, track progress in more detail, and ensure small steps aren't missed. This approach improves task management and reduces the likelihood of overlooking critical steps.
