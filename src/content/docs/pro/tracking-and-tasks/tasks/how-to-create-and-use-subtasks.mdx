## How can I use the checklist field to create subtasks?

You know how some tasks have multiple moving parts? That's where the **Checklist** [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) type comes in handy. It lets you break down any task into smaller, trackable subtasks. Perfect for when you need to keep tabs on several related actions within a single step.

### What are checklist subtasks?

When you add a Checklist field to a task:
- You create a list of items that belong to the parent task
- Users check off each item as they go
- You decide the rules - does someone need to check all items or just some?

### How do I create checklist subtasks in a template?

<Steps>
1. Open your [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in **Edit** mode.
2. Click the step where you want to add the checklist.
3. Go to the **Form Fields** tab in the settings panel (usually right).
4. Click **Add field**.
5. Name the field (e.g., "Preparation Checklist").
6. Choose **Checklist** as the field type.
7. In the **Options** box, type each subtask on its own line.
8. Choose a **Validation** rule (see below).
9. *(Optional)* Pre-check items that should be checked by default. See [Set default content for form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-set-default-content-for-form-fields/) for more details about default selections.
10. Click **Save**.
</Steps>

### How do checklist completion rules work (validation)?

Here's the thing - you need to tell Tallyfy when a checklist is actually complete. You've got two options:

*   **Require 'at least one' item**: The checklist counts as done when *at least one* box gets checked. Great for when you're offering options or only need one action completed.
*   **Require 'all items'**: *Every* single box must be checked. Use this when all subtasks are non-negotiable.

Pick whichever matches your workflow.

### How do I complete checklist subtasks when running a process?

Working through a checklist? Simple:

<Steps>
1. Open the task.
2. The checklist appears in the form fields.
3. Check off items as you complete them.
4. Once you meet the validation rule (either 'at least one' or 'all items' checked), you can complete the parent task - assuming you've filled out any other required fields too.
</Steps>

### What are best practices for using checklists as subtasks?

Want your checklists to actually work? Here's what we've learned:

*   **Be crystal clear**: Each item should spell out exactly what needs doing
*   **Keep it manageable**: 3-7 items per checklist hits the sweet spot (trust me on this)
*   **Start with action verbs**: "Verify ID", "Upload document" - not "ID verification needed"
*   **Think about sequence**: Put items in the order people will actually do them
*   **Validation matters**: Really think about whether you need everything checked or just some items
*   **Don't skip the guidance text**: A little extra context never hurt anyone

### What are examples of effective checklists?

**QA Check:**
```text
- Check spelling
- Verify links
- Test on mobile
```

**Onboarding:**
```text
- Send welcome pack
- Schedule intro meeting
- Grant system access
```

Checklists might seem simple, but they're incredibly effective at keeping work organized. You'll catch those small-but-important steps that often slip through the cracks. The result? Better task management and fewer "oops, I forgot" moments.
