## Using the Checklist Field to Create Subtasks

Sometimes a single step in your process involves several smaller actions. You can break down a complex [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) into a list of subtasks using the **Checklist** [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) type. This helps track progress within a larger step.

### What are Checklist Subtasks?

When you add a Checklist field to a task:
- You create a list of smaller items related to the main task.
- Users can check off each item as they complete it.
- You can set rules for when the checklist (and potentially the main task) is considered complete.

### Creating Checklist Subtasks in a Template

<Steps>
1. Open your [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in **Edit** mode.
2. Click on the step where you want to add the subtask checklist.
3. Go to the **Form Fields** tab in the step details panel.
4. Click **Add field**.
5. Give the field a name (e.g., "Preparation Checklist").
6. Choose **Checklist** as the Field Type.
7. In the **Options** box, type each subtask item on its own line.
8. Choose a **Validation** rule (see below).
9. *(Optional)* Pre-check any items that should be checked by default.
10. Click **Save**.
</Steps>

### Checklist Completion Rules (Validation)

You need to tell Tallyfy when the checklist part of the task is considered finished:

*   **Require at least one item**: The checklist is considered complete if *at least one* box is checked. Good for optional items or when only one of several actions is needed.
*   **Require all items**: *Every single box* in the checklist must be checked before the checklist (and possibly the main task) can be marked as complete. Good for critical steps where nothing can be missed.

Choose the validation rule that makes sense for your subtasks.

### Completing Checklist Subtasks When Running a Process

When someone is assigned the task with the checklist:

<Steps>
1. They open the task.
2. They see the checklist within the form fields.
3. They check off items as they complete them.
4. Once they have met the validation rule you set (checked at least one, or checked all), they can then complete the main task (assuming all other required fields are also done).
</Steps>

### Tips for Using Checklists as Subtasks

*   **Be clear**: Make each checklist item a specific, understandable action.
*   **Keep lists short**: Aim for roughly 3-7 items per checklist if possible.
*   **Use action verbs**: Start each item with a verb (e.g., "Verify ID", "Upload Document").
*   **Order logically**: Put items in the order they should ideally be done.
*   **Choose validation carefully**: Decide if *all* items are truly required, or just *some*.
*   **Add guidance**: Use the field's guidance text option to add extra explanation if needed.

### Example Checklists

**QA Check:**
```
- Check spelling
- Verify links
- Test on mobile
```

**Onboarding:**
```
- Send welcome pack
- Schedule intro meeting
- Grant system access
```

Using checklists helps break down work, track progress more granularly, and ensure all necessary small steps are considered.
