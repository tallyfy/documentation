## Use the checklist field to create subtasks

The **Checklist** [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) type breaks down any task into smaller, trackable subtasks. It's perfect when a single step has multiple actions that need tracking.

When you add a Checklist field to a task:
- You create a list of checkable items within the parent task
- Users check off each item as they go
- You control the completion rule - no validation, at least one item, or all items checked

### How do I create checklist subtasks in a template?

<Steps>
1. Open your [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in **Edit** mode.
2. Click the step where you want to add the checklist.
3. Go to the **Form Fields** tab in the step settings panel.
4. Click **Add a field**.
5. Name the field (e.g., "Preparation Checklist").
6. Choose **Checklist** as the field type.
7. Add each subtask as a separate option using the **Add Another Option** button.
8. Select a completion rule (see below).
9. *(Optional)* Pre-check items that should be checked by default. See [Set default content for form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-set-default-content-for-form-fields/) for details.
10. Click **Save**.
</Steps>

### How do checklist completion rules work?

Tallyfy gives you three options for when a checklist counts as complete:

*   **No validation**: The checklist doesn't block task completion. Users can check items optionally.
*   **At least one item must be checked**: The task can't be completed until at least one box is checked. Good when you're offering choices.
*   **All items must be checked**: Every single box must be checked. Use this when all subtasks are mandatory.

### How do I complete checklist subtasks when running a process?

<Steps>
1. Open the task.
2. The checklist appears in the form fields section.
3. Check off items as you complete them.
4. Once you've met the completion rule, you can complete the parent task - assuming you've also filled out any other required fields.
</Steps>

### Best practices for checklists

*   **Be specific**: Each item should spell out exactly what needs doing
*   **Keep it manageable**: 3-7 items per checklist works best
*   **Start with action verbs**: "Verify ID", "Upload document" - not "ID verification needed"
*   **Order matters**: Put items in the sequence people will actually do them
*   **Pick the right rule**: Think about whether you need everything checked or just some items
*   **Add guidance text**: A brief description helps people understand what's expected

### Example checklists

**QA Check:**
```text
- Check spelling

```

**Onboarding:**
```text
- Send welcome pack
- Schedule intro meeting
- Grant system access
```
