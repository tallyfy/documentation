## Reporting and resolving issues

Report a problem on any task by checking **Report issue** in the comment area, typing your description, and posting. Everyone assigned to the task gets notified. To resolve it later, check **Resolve issue** and add a comment explaining the fix.

A task with an unresolved issue can't be completed until the issue is resolved. If the task was already completed, reporting an issue automatically reopens it.

### Report an issue on a task

<Steps>
1. Open the [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) where the problem exists.
2. Go to the **Comments** section.
3. Check the **Report issue** checkbox and type your problem description.

4. Click **Add Comment** to post.
5. All task assignees and participants get notified by email and in-app notification.

6. The task shows a warning indicator, and the overall process status changes to "problem" while any issue remains unresolved.

### Suggest template improvements

You can add improvement comments directly on template steps to suggest changes for future processes.

#### Add improvement comments

<Steps>
1. Go to the **Templates** library and **View** the template.
2. Find the specific step you have feedback for.
3. Click the **Comment** button on that step.
4. Type your suggestion for improving the step in future processes.
5. Click **Submit**.
</Steps>

These comments attach to the template step itself - they aren't tied to any specific running process.

#### View improvement comments

<Steps>
1. Open the template in **Edit** mode.
2. Go to the **Comments** section in the sidebar.
3. View comments grouped by step.
4. You can also click a step in the editor - if it has comments, an indicator shows them.
</Steps>

#### Act on improvement comments

Template owners and editors can:
*   Mark comments as 'Read'.
*   Edit the template based on feedback.
*   'Hide' addressed comments.
*   Reply for clarification.
