## Improvement Comments for [Templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)

Improvement comments are a powerful feature in Tallyfy that enable crowdsourced process improvement. Unlike regular task comments or blocker reports, improvement comments are specifically tied to [template steps](/products/pro/documenting/templates/edit-templates/edit-steps/) and provide valuable feedback to process owners.

### Adding Improvement Comments to Templates

When viewing a template (not a running process), you can provide feedback on specific steps:

<Steps>
1. Navigate to the template you want to provide feedback on
2. Locate the step you want to comment on
3. Click the **Comment** button in the step
4. Enter your improvement suggestion
5. Click **Submit** to add your improvement comment
</Steps>

Your comment will be associated with that specific step in the template and will be visible to the template owner.

### How [Template Owners](/products/pro/documenting/members/) Can View Improvement Comments

If you're a template owner or process owner, you can review improvement suggestions:

<Steps>
1. Open the template in edit mode
2. Navigate to the **Comments** section in the sidebar
3. View all improvement comments organized by template step
4. Each comment shows the commenter's name, date, and feedback content
</Steps>

Alternatively, when editing a specific step:

<Steps>
1. Open the step for editing
2. Look for the **Improvement Comments** indicator showing the number of suggestions
3. Click to expand and view all comments for that particular step
</Steps>

### Managing Improvement Comments

As a template owner, you can:

<Steps>
1. **Acknowledge Comments**: Mark a comment as "Read" to indicate you've seen it
2. **Implement Suggestions**: Make template changes based on valuable feedback
3. **Hide Resolved Comments**: Once addressed, click the **Hide** button to collapse comments that have been implemented
4. **Respond to Comments**: Reply directly to improvement suggestions for clarification
</Steps>

### Benefits of Crowdsourced Process Improvement

Improvement comments foster collaborative [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) enhancement by:

- Allowing those who use the process to provide direct feedback
- Capturing ideas for optimization while they're fresh in users' minds
- Creating a systematic approach to continuous improvement
- Enabling process owners to prioritize changes based on user feedback
- Building a history of process evolution and refinement

This feedback mechanism helps organizations refine their processes over time, leading to greater efficiency and effectiveness.
