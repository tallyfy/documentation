## Improvement Comments for Templates

Improvement comments are a powerful feature in Tallyfy that enable crowdsourced process improvement. Unlike regular task comments or blocker reports, improvement comments are specifically tied to template steps and provide valuable feedback to process owners.

### Adding Improvement Comments to Templates

When viewing a template (not a running process), you can provide feedback on specific steps:

1. Navigate to the template you want to provide feedback on
2. Locate the step you want to comment on
3. Click the **Comment** button in the step
4. Enter your improvement suggestion
5. Click **Submit** to add your improvement comment

Your comment will be associated with that specific step in the template and will be visible to the template owner.

### How Template Owners Can View Improvement Comments

If you're a template owner or process owner, you can review improvement suggestions:

1. Open the template in edit mode
2. Navigate to the **Comments** section in the sidebar
3. View all improvement comments organized by template step
4. Each comment shows the commenter's name, date, and feedback content

Alternatively, when editing a specific step:

1. Open the step for editing
2. Look for the **Improvement Comments** indicator showing the number of suggestions
3. Click to expand and view all comments for that particular step

### Managing Improvement Comments

As a template owner, you can:

1. **Acknowledge Comments**: Mark a comment as "Read" to indicate you've seen it
2. **Implement Suggestions**: Make template changes based on valuable feedback
3. **Hide Resolved Comments**: Once addressed, click the **Hide** button to collapse comments that have been implemented
4. **Respond to Comments**: Reply directly to improvement suggestions for clarification

### Benefits of Crowdsourced Process Improvement

Improvement comments foster collaborative process enhancement by:

- Allowing those who use the process to provide direct feedback
- Capturing ideas for optimization while they're fresh in users' minds
- Creating a systematic approach to continuous improvement
- Enabling process owners to prioritize changes based on user feedback
- Building a history of process evolution and refinement

This feedback mechanism helps organizations refine their processes over time, leading to greater efficiency and effectiveness.
