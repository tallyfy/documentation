## How can I report and resolve issues in Tallyfy?

Tallyfy offers comprehensive issue reporting and resolution capabilities including workflow blocker flagging and template improvement suggestions.

These feedback mechanisms enable continuous workflow optimization while providing immediate problem resolution pathways for active processes and long-term template enhancement opportunities.

### How do I report task blockers in Tallyfy?

When encountering problems that prevent task completion within running processes, Tallyfy's blocker reporting system enables immediate issue escalation and resolution tracking.

Reporting blockers ensures prompt attention to workflow obstacles while maintaining process visibility and accountability:

<Steps>
1. Open the [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) where the problem exists.
2. Go to the **Comments** section.
3. Click **Add Comment** and choose the **Blocker** option (often a red flag icon).

4. Explain the problem in the comment and click **Post**.
5. **Notifications**: Everyone involved is notified (in-app and email) about the blocker.

6. **Visual indicators**: The task gets a red border/icon, and the process bar might also turn red to highlight the problem.

</Steps>

### How do I resolve an issue (blocker)?

Once the blocker is fixed, anyone involved can resolve the blocker comment.

<Steps>
1. Go to the comment reporting the blocker.
2. Click the option to **Resolve** the issue (this might be under a menu on the comment).

3. You might add a comment explaining how it was fixed.
4. The red indicators disappear, and the resolving comment might be highlighted green.
</Steps>

### How can I find processes with unresolved issues?

To see running processes with active blockers:

<Steps>
1. Go to the **[Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** view.
2. Click **Add Filter**.
3. Choose the filter **Show** -> **With issues**.

### How can I suggest improvements to templates?

If you have an idea to make the original template better (not just fix a one-time problem), add an improvement comment on the template.

#### How do I add improvement comments on templates?

<Steps>
1. Go to the **Templates** library and **View** the template.
2. Find the specific step you have feedback for.
3. Click the **Comment** button on that step.
4. Type your suggestion for improving the step in future processes.
5. Click **Submit**.
</Steps>

This comment links to the template step, not a running process.

#### How can template owners view improvement comments?

Users who can edit the template can see these suggestions:

<Steps>
1. Open the template in **Edit** mode.
2. Go to the **Comments** section in the sidebar.
3. View comments grouped by step.
4. *Alternatively*, click a step in the editor; if it has comments, an indicator shows them.
</Steps>

#### How can I act on improvement comments?

Template owners/editors can:
*   Mark comments as 'Read'.
*   Edit the template based on feedback.
*   'Hide' addressed comments.
*   Reply for clarification.

Using improvement comments helps gather feedback from users and supports continuous improvement of your standard processes.
