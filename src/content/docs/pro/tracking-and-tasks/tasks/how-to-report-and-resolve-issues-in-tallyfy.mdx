## Reporting task blockers and suggesting template improvements

Tallyfy provides ways to flag problems in running workflows (Blockers) and suggest changes to templates (Improvement Comments).

### Reporting an issue (blocker) on a task

If you have a problem stopping you completing a task in a running process, you can report it.

<Steps>
1. Open the [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) where the problem exists.
2. Go to the **Comments** section.
3. Click **Add Comment** and choose the **Blocker** option (often a red flag icon).

4. Explain the problem in the comment and click **Post**.
5. **Notifications**: Everyone involved is notified (in-app and email) about the blocker.

6. **Visual indicators**: The task gets a red border/icon, and the process bar might also turn red to highlight the problem.

</Steps>

### Resolving an issue (blocker)

Once the blocker is fixed, anyone involved can resolve the blocker comment.

<Steps>
1. Go to the comment reporting the blocker.
2. Click the option to **Resolve** the issue (this might be under a menu on the comment).

3. You might add a comment explaining how it was fixed.
4. The red indicators disappear, and the resolving comment might be highlighted green.
</Steps>

### Finding processes with unresolved issues

To see running processes with active blockers:

<Steps>
1. Go to the **[Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** view.
2. Click **Add Filter**.
3. Choose the filter **Show** -> **With issues**.

### Suggesting improvements to templates

If you have an idea to make the original template better (not just fix a one-time problem), add an improvement comment on the template.

#### Adding improvement comments (on templates)

<Steps>
1. Go to the **Templates** library and **View** the template.
2. Find the specific step you have feedback for.
3. Click the **Comment** button on that step.
4. Type your suggestion for improving the step in future processes.
5. Click **Submit**.
</Steps>

This comment links to the template step, not a running process.

#### Viewing improvement comments (template owners/editors)

Users who can edit the template can see these suggestions:

<Steps>
1. Open the template in **Edit** mode.
2. Go to the **Comments** section in the sidebar.
3. View comments grouped by step.
4. *Alternatively*, click a step in the editor; if it has comments, an indicator shows them.
</Steps>

#### Acting on improvement comments

Template owners/editors can:
*   Mark comments as 'Read'.
*   Edit the template based on feedback.
*   'Hide' addressed comments.
*   Reply for clarification.

Using improvement comments helps gather feedback from users and supports continuous improvement of your standard processes.
