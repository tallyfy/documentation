## Reporting and resolving workflow issues

To report a problem or issue that blocks task completion, use the **Blocker** comment feature. Navigate to the task, add a comment, select the **Blocker** option (red flag icon), and explain the problem. To resolve the issue once fixed, find the blocker comment and click **Resolve**.


### Report task blockers

When a task can't be completed due to an issue, report it as a blocker (previously called "report/resolve problem"):

<Steps>
1. Open the [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) where the problem exists.
2. Go to the **Comments** section.
3. Click **Add Comment** and choose the **Blocker** option (often a red flag icon).

4. Explain the problem in the comment and click **Post**.
5. **Notifications**: Everyone involved is notified (in-app and email) about the blocker.

6. **Visual indicators**: The task gets a red border/icon, and the process bar might also turn red to highlight the problem.

</Steps>

### Resolve blockers

Anyone involved with the task can mark a blocker as resolved:

<Steps>
1. Go to the comment reporting the blocker.
2. Click the option to **Resolve** the issue (this might be under a menu on the comment).

3. You might add a comment explaining how it was fixed.
4. The red indicators disappear, and the resolving comment might be highlighted green.
</Steps>

### Find processes with unresolved issues

To see running processes with active blockers:

<Steps>
1. Go to the **[Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** view.
2. Click **Add Filter**.
3. Choose the filter **Show** -> **With issues**.

### Suggest template improvements

Add improvement comments directly on templates to make future processes better.

#### Add improvement comments

<Steps>
1. Go to the **Templates** library and **View** the template.
2. Find the specific step you have feedback for.
3. Click the **Comment** button on that step.
4. Type your suggestion for improving the step in future processes.
5. Click **Submit**.
</Steps>

Important: These comments attach to the template step itself - they're not tied to any specific running process.

#### View improvement comments

If you can edit the template, here's how to see these suggestions:

<Steps>
1. Open the template in **Edit** mode.
2. Go to the **Comments** section in the sidebar.
3. View comments grouped by step.
4. *Alternatively*, click a step in the editor; if it has comments, an indicator shows them.
</Steps>

#### Act on improvement comments

Template owners/editors can:
*   Mark comments as 'Read'.
*   Edit the template based on feedback.
*   'Hide' addressed comments.
*   Reply for clarification.
