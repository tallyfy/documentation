## Reporting Task Blockers and Suggesting Template Improvements

Tallyfy has ways to flag problems in running processes (Blockers) and suggest changes to the original templates (Improvement Comments).

### Reporting an Issue (Blocker) on a Task

If you encounter a problem that stops you from completing a task in a *running process*, you can report it as a blocker.

<Steps>
1. Open the [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) where the problem is.
2. Go to the **Comments** section at the bottom.
3. Click **Add Comment** and choose the **Blocker** option (often has a red flag icon).

4. Type a comment explaining the problem and click **Post**.
5. **Notifications**: Everyone involved in the process will get notified (in-app and via email) about the blocker.

6. **Visual Cues**: The task will get a red border/icon, and the process progress bar might also turn red to highlight the issue.

</Steps>

### Resolving an Issue (Blocker)

Once the problem is fixed, anyone involved in the process can mark the blocker as resolved.

<Steps>
1. Go to the comment that reported the blocker.
2. Click the option to **Resolve** the issue (this might be under a "Tag" or menu on the comment).

3. You might be prompted to add a comment explaining the resolution.
4. The red flags and borders will disappear, and the resolving comment might be highlighted (e.g., in green).
</Steps>

### Finding Processes with Unresolved Issues

To see all running processes that currently have active blockers:

<Steps>
1. Go to the **[Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** view.
2. Click **Add Filter**.
3. Choose the filter option **Show** -> **With issues**.

</Steps>

### Suggesting Improvements to Templates

If you have an idea to make the original process *template* better (not just fix a problem in one specific run), you can add an Improvement Comment directly on the template.

#### Adding Improvement Comments (on Templates)

<Steps>
1. Go to the **Templates** library and **View** the template you want to suggest an improvement for.
2. Find the specific step you have feedback on.
3. Click the **Comment** button on that step.
4. Type your suggestion for improving this step in future processes.
5. Click **Submit**.
</Steps>

This comment is linked to the template step itself, not to any running process.

#### Viewing Improvement Comments (Template Owners/Editors)

People who can edit the template can see these suggestions:

<Steps>
1. Open the template in **Edit** mode.
2. Go to the **Comments** section in the sidebar.
3. See all improvement comments grouped by step.
4. *Alternatively*, click on a specific step in the editor; if it has improvement comments, an indicator will show them.
</Steps>

#### Acting on Improvement Comments

Template owners/editors can:
*   Mark comments as "Read".
*   Edit the template based on the feedback.
*   "Hide" comments that have been addressed.
*   Reply to comments for clarification.

Using improvement comments helps gather feedback from people using the processes and allows for continuous improvement of your standard workflows.
