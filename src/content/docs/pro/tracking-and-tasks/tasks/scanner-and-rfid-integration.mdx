## How scanners and RFID readers can work with Tallyfy form fields

Most barcode scanners and RFID readers use keyboard wedge mode - they act like a keyboard and type scanned data directly into whatever field has focus. This means they already work with Tallyfy's form fields without any special integration.

:::note
Tallyfy doesn't yet have built-in scanner detection or scanner-specific features. The approach described here uses your scanner's standard keyboard emulation mode, which works with any web application including Tallyfy.

## Keyboard wedge mode (works today)

Any scanner in USB HID (Human Interface Device) mode can fill Tallyfy form fields right now. Here's how:

1. Set your scanner to USB HID Keyboard mode (most scanners default to this)
2. Configure it to send an Enter or Tab keystroke after each scan
3. Click into a Tallyfy text or number form field
4. Scan your barcode or RFID tag - the data appears instantly

Quick test: open any text editor and scan something. If text appears, your scanner will work with Tallyfy.

## Compatible hardware

These scanner types work with Tallyfy through keyboard wedge mode:

- **USB barcode scanners** - any HID-compatible model (the vast majority of USB scanners)
- **Bluetooth scanners** - paired to your computer or mobile device
- **RFID readers** - those that support keyboard wedge output
- **2D/QR code scanners** - work the same as 1D barcode scanners

### Recommended scanner settings

Check your scanner's manual for these settings:

- **Interface mode**: USB HID Keyboard or Bluetooth HID
- **Suffix character**: CR (Carriage Return/Enter) or Tab
- **Inter-character delay**: 5ms if you see dropped characters
- **Prefix**: optional, but helpful for identifying the scan source

## Practical use cases

### Warehouse receiving

1. Open a receiving process in Tallyfy
2. Scan the pallet barcode into the Pallet ID field
3. Scan each item into the items list
4. Scan the storage location QR code into the location field

### Quality control checkpoints

1. Scan the product serial number into the inspection form
2. Scan PASS or FAIL QR codes at each checkpoint
3. Scan the inspector badge to record sign-off

### Asset management

Scan an asset tag to look up its record. Scan a location QR code to update where the asset is. This works well for IT equipment, tools, or medical devices.

## Why scanning beats manual entry

**Speed** - a scan takes under a second. Typing a 12-digit code takes 5-10 seconds.

**Accuracy** - scanners don't make typos. With long alphanumeric codes, scanning removes transcription errors entirely.

**Audit trail** - each scan creates a timestamped form field entry you can trace back.

## Common questions

### Will my existing scanner work?

If it types text into Notepad when you scan, it'll work with Tallyfy form fields.

### Do I need special software?

No. Keyboard wedge scanners need no drivers, plugins, or extra software.

### What about RFID tags?

RFID readers that output in keyboard wedge mode work exactly like barcode scanners. Tap the tag, data appears in the focused field.

### How do I prevent scanning into the wrong field?

Click the correct field before scanning. Configuring your scanner to send a Tab suffix after each scan can auto-advance to the next field.

## Preparing your workflows for scanning

**Test your hardware** - confirm your scanners work in HID mode by scanning into a text editor first.

**Design for scanning order** - arrange form fields in the same sequence your workers physically scan items.

**Standardize barcode formats** - consistent prefixes (like "EMP" for employees, "SKU" for products) help workers identify what they're scanning.
