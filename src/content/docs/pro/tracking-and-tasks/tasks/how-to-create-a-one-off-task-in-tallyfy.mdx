## How to create a one-off task

A "One-Off" [Task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) is a single, standalone task that isn't part of a reusable [process template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). Use these for quick to-do items or things that don't need a full workflow.

To create a one-off task:

<Steps>
1. Click the **+ Create** button (usually top left) and choose **Create task**.

2. Fill in the details for the task:
    * **Name**: Give the task a clear title.
    * **Type**: Choose the task type (Regular, Approve/Reject, etc.).
    * **Description**: Add any instructions or details.
    * **Assignee**: Choose who should do the task. You can leave this blank to create an unassigned task (see note below).
    * **Deadline**: Set a due date.
    * **Form Fields**: Add any [forms](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) if needed.
    * **Advanced**: You can optionally link this task to appear within a specific running process.

   :::note[Creating Unassigned Tasks]
You don't have to assign a task immediately. If you leave the assignee field empty, the task is created as "Unassigned". You can find these later using filters in the [Tasks view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/).

3. Click **Create Task** (or similar save button).
4. If you assigned the task, the assignee will get a notification.
5. You will get a notification when the task is completed.
