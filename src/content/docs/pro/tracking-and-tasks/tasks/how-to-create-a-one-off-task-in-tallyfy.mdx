## How to create a simple one-off task

First, let's talk about what a One-Off Task is. Imagine it as that one item on your to-do list that you need to do just once, or once in a while. It could be anything from ordering new print cartridges to confirming caterer choices for the annual employee lunch.

Now, let's get to creating a One-Off Task in Tallyfy. Here are the simple steps:

1. Click the "+ Create" button in your sidebar and click on "Create task".

2. Give your task a name and add more details such as the task type, description, who it's assigned to, deadline, and even forms if needed. You can also link it to an existing process for more advanced tracking.

3. Once you're done, you'll see a confirmation message.
4. The assigned tasks will be sent as notifications to the assignee via email or in-app notification, depending on their settings. They will also appear as pending tasks in the member's notifications and email reminders.
5. And when a member or guest completes the task, you'll receive a notification letting you know.

That's all there is to it! You've now mastered the art of creating a One-Off Task on Tallyfy. Give it a try and make managing your tasks a breeze!
