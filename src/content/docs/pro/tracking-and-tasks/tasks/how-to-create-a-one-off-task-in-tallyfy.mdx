## Create a one-off task

Click **+ Create** and choose **Create task** to make a standalone to-do with a deadline and assignee - no [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) needed.

One-off [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in Tallyfy are independent action items. Use them for urgent work, follow-up actions, or anything that doesn't fit a standard process.

### When to use one-off tasks

Got a quick request that doesn't fit your standard processes? One-off tasks let you track it in Tallyfy without building a whole template. Follow-ups, document reviews, unexpected requests - they all work here alongside your process-based workflows.

<Steps>
1. Click the **+ Create** button and choose **Create task**.
2. ![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-show-create-task-from-button.png)

3. Fill in the task details:
</Steps>

- **Name**: A clear title for the task (up to 600 characters).
- **Type**: Pick a task type - Regular works for most things, but you've also got Approve/Reject, [Expiring](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-types-of-tasks-can-i-create-with-tallyfy/) (auto-completes at deadline to prevent [task debt](/products/pro/tutorials/how-to/how-to-avoid-task-debt/)), Email, and Auto-Send Email.
- **Description**: Instructions or context the assignee needs.
- **Assignee**: Who's doing this? You can assign members, groups, or guests.
- **Deadline**: Required. When the task must be done.
- **Start time**: Optional. When work should begin.
- **Form fields**: Add [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to collect data on completion.
- **Advanced**: Link this task to a running process or template, add tags, set a webhook, or toggle settings like "everyone must complete."

:::note[Start time vs deadline]
- **Start time**: When someone should start working. It's guidance only - not enforced.
- **Deadline**: When it must be done. Miss this and the task shows as overdue.

</Steps>

## What should I learn next?

- [Complete or reopen tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-can-i-complete-or-reopen-tasks-in-tallyfy/) when things need a second look
- [Create subtasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-create-and-use-subtasks/) to break work into smaller pieces
- Use the [Tasks view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/) to manage all your tasks in one place
