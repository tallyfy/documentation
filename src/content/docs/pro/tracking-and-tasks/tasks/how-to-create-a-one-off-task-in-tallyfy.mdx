## How to create a one-off task

A "One-Off" [Task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) is a single, standalone task that isn't part of a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). Use these for quick to-dos or items that don't need a full process.

### Why one-off tasks are useful

One-off tasks provide flexibility in your workflow management by letting you create quick action items without setting up an entire process. They're perfect for unexpected work, simple follow-ups, or small tasks that don't fit into your standard processes. This feature helps you track all your work in one system rather than using separate tools for structured processes and simple to-dos.

To create a one-off task:

<Steps>
1. Click the **+ Create** button (usually top left) and choose **Create task**.
2. ![Create task button location](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-show-create-task-from-button.png)

3. Fill in the task details:
</Steps>

- **Name**: Set a clear task name.
- **Type**: Choose the task type (Regular, Approve/Reject, etc.).
- **Description**: Add instructions or details.
- **Assignee**: Select who should do the task. You can leave this blank to create an unassigned task (see note).
- **Deadline**: Set the due date.
- **Form Fields**: Add [forms](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) if needed.
- **Advanced**: Optionally link this task to appear within a running process.

 :::note[Creating unassigned tasks]
You don't have to assign the task right away. If you leave the assignee field empty, the task is created as 'Unassigned'. You can find unassigned tasks later using filters in the [Tasks view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/).

4. Click **Create Task**.
5. If you assigned the task, the assignee gets a notification.
6. You get a notification when the task is completed.
</Steps>
