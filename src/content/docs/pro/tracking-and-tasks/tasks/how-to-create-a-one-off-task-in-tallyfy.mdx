## How to create a one-off task

A One-Off [Task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) is a standalone task that is not part of a [process template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). These tasks are useful for one-time actions or occasional tasks that don't need to be part of a recurring [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).

To create a One-Off Task in Tallyfy:

<Steps>
1. Click the "+ Create" button in your sidebar and click on "Create task".

2. Give your task a name and add more details such as the task type, description, who it's assigned to, deadline, and even [forms](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) if needed. You can also link it to an existing process for more advanced tracking.

   :::note[Creating tasks without assignees]
   Tallyfy now allows you to create tasks without assigning them to anyone. Simply leave the assignee field empty. These tasks will appear with a default avatar and labeled as "Nobody Assigned" in task lists and notifications. You can find these unassigned tasks using the "Assigned to nobody" filter in the [Tasks view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/).

3. Once you're done, you'll see a confirmation message.
4. The assigned tasks will be sent as notifications to the assignee via email or in-app notification, depending on their settings. They will also appear as pending tasks in the member's notifications and email reminders.
5. And when a [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) or [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) completes the task, you'll receive a notification letting you know.
