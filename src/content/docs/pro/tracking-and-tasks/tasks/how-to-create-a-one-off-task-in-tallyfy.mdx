## How can I create a one-off task in Tallyfy?

Click the **+ Create** button and choose **Create task** - that's it. You'll get a form where you can add task details, assign it to someone, and set a deadline. Perfect for those quick to-dos that don't need a full process template.

One-off [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in Tallyfy are standalone action items. They're independent of [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), which makes them incredibly flexible for urgent work or follow-up actions.

### Why are one-off tasks valuable for workflow management?

Ever had a quick request land on your desk that doesn't fit any of your standard processes? That's where one-off tasks shine.

You don't need to build a whole template just to assign someone a simple task. Maybe it's following up with a client, reviewing a document, or handling an unexpected request - these tasks let you track everything in Tallyfy without overcomplicating things. No more sticky notes or separate to-do apps.

The best part? They work alongside your process-based workflows. Everything stays visible in one place.

Here's the step-by-step process:

<Steps>
1. Click the **+ Create** button (you'll find it at the top left) and choose **Create task**.
2. ![Create task button location](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-show-create-task-from-button.png)

3. Fill in the task details:
</Steps>

- **Name**: What's the task about? Keep it clear.
- **Type**: Pick your task type - Regular works for most things, but you've got Approve/Reject and other options too.
- **Description**: Add any instructions or context the assignee needs.
- **Assignee**: Who's doing this? (You can skip this and assign it later - see the note below).
- **Deadline**: When should this be done? This is your due date.
- **Start Time**: When should work begin? Optional, but helpful for planning.
- **Form Fields**: Need to collect data? Add [forms](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/).
- **Advanced**: You can even link this task to a running process if needed.

 :::note[Creating unassigned tasks]
Don't know who should handle this yet? No problem. Leave the assignee field empty and the task gets created as 'Unassigned'. You can find these tasks later using filters in the [Tasks view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/).

:::note[Understanding start time vs deadline in one-off tasks]
Here's something that trips people up - you can set two different times:

- **Start time**: When someone should start working on this. Great for planning.
- **Deadline**: When it needs to be done. Miss this and the task shows as overdue.

The start time is just guidance (nobody's enforcing it), but the deadline? That's what matters for tracking.

<Steps>
4. Click **Create Task**. Done!
5. If you assigned it to someone, they'll get a notification right away.
6. When they complete it, you'll get notified too.
</Steps>

## What should I learn next?

Got your first one-off task created? Nice work. 

Next, you might want to see how to [complete or reopen tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-can-i-complete-or-reopen-tasks-in-tallyfy/) - because sometimes things need a second look. For bigger tasks, check out [subtasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-create-and-use-subtasks/) to break work into manageable chunks.

Need to juggle multiple tasks? The [Tasks view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/) is where you'll spend most of your time.
