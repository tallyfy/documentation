## How can I create a one-off task in Tallyfy?

One-off [Tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) represent standalone action items independent of [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), providing flexibility for quick to-dos and items not requiring full process workflows.

These individual tasks enable rapid task creation for urgent items, follow-up actions, or work that falls outside standardized process templates.

### Why are one-off tasks valuable for workflow management?

One-off tasks deliver essential workflow flexibility by enabling rapid action item creation without requiring complete process setup or template development.

These standalone tasks prove particularly valuable for unexpected work requests, simple follow-up actions, or smaller tasks that don't align with established process templates. This capability consolidates all work tracking within a single system, eliminating the need for separate tools to manage structured processes versus simple task management.

By integrating one-off tasks with process-based workflows, teams maintain comprehensive work visibility while preserving operational agility.

To create a one-off task:

<Steps>
1. Click the **+ Create** button (usually top left) and choose **Create task**.
2. ![Create task button location](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-show-create-task-from-button.png)

3. Fill in the task details:
</Steps>

- **Name**: Set a clear task name.
- **Type**: Choose the task type (Regular, Approve/Reject, etc.).
- **Description**: Add instructions or details.
- **Assignee**: Select who should do the task. You can leave this blank to create an unassigned task (see note).
- **Deadline**: Set when the work should be **complete** (the due date).
- **Start Time**: Optionally set when work should **begin** on the task (provides scheduling guidance but is not enforced).
- **Form Fields**: Add [forms](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) if needed.
- **Advanced**: Optionally link this task to appear within a running process.

 :::note[Creating unassigned tasks]
You don't have to assign the task right away. If you leave the assignee field empty, the task is created as 'Unassigned'. You can find unassigned tasks later using filters in the [Tasks view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/).

:::note[Understanding start time vs deadline in one-off tasks]
When creating one-off tasks, you can set both timing elements:

- **Start time**: When work should **begin** on the task. This helps with planning and provides scheduling guidance to the assignee.
- **Deadline**: When work should be **complete** on the task. This is the due date that determines if the task becomes overdue.

Setting a start time is optional and provides helpful scheduling context, while the deadline determines task completion urgency.

4. Click **Create Task**.
5. If you assigned the task, the assignee gets a notification.
6. You get a notification when the task is completed.
</Steps>

## What should I learn next?

After creating your one-off task, you might want to learn how to [complete or reopen tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-can-i-complete-or-reopen-tasks-in-tallyfy/) and how to [create and use subtasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-create-and-use-subtasks/) for breaking down complex work items. If you need to track multiple tasks, explore the [Tasks view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/) to manage your workload efficiently.
