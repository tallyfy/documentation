## How to create a simple one-off task

A One-Off Task is a standalone task that is not part of a process template. These tasks are useful for one-time actions or occasional tasks that don't need to be part of a recurring process.

To create a One-Off Task in Tallyfy:

1. Click the "+ Create" button in your sidebar and click on "Create task".

2. Give your task a name and add more details such as the task type, description, who it's assigned to, deadline, and even forms if needed. You can also link it to an existing process for more advanced tracking.

   :::note[Creating tasks without assignees]
   Tallyfy now allows you to create tasks without assigning them to anyone. Simply leave the assignee field empty. These tasks will appear with a default avatar and labeled as "Nobody Assigned" in task lists and notifications. You can find these unassigned tasks using the "Assigned to nobody" filter in the Tasks view.

3. Once you're done, you'll see a confirmation message.
4. The assigned tasks will be sent as notifications to the assignee via email or in-app notification, depending on their settings. They will also appear as pending tasks in the member's notifications and email reminders.
5. And when a member or guest completes the task, you'll receive a notification letting you know.
