## How to manually control task visibility

Click the **three dots (⋮)** menu on any non-completed task and select **Hide This Task** or **Show This Task** to control visibility in running processes.

This is useful when someone changes a form selection mid-process - say, switching from "Corporation" to "LLC" - and now irrelevant tasks are cluttering the view. Or when your [automation rules](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) didn't cover this specific scenario.

:::note
You can't hide or show completed tasks or one-off (standalone) tasks. The option only appears for incomplete tasks within a running process.
:::

## When to use manual show/hide

- **Mid-process pivots** - a customer switches from "New Installation" to "Upgrade" after starting the process
- **Automation gaps** - your rules show tasks that shouldn't appear in this scenario
- **One-time exceptions** - a compliance task isn't needed for this specific client, but you can't remove it from the template
- **Testing** - you're walking through different process paths without launching separate test runs

## How to hide a task

<Steps>
1. **Open your running process** with the task you want to hide

2. **Find the task** in your process view

3. **Click the three dots (⋮)** on the task card

4. **Select "Hide This Task"** from the menu

5. **Add a comment** explaining why you're hiding it (a comment dialog appears - this is optional but recommended)

6. **Confirm** and the task disappears from view
</Steps>

The task vanishes from the active view but Tallyfy keeps it in the process - nothing gets deleted.

## How to show a hidden task

<Steps>
1. **Find hidden tasks** in your process view using the filters or view options

2. **Locate the hidden task** you want to restore

3. **Click the three dots (⋮)** on the hidden task

4. **Select "Show This Task"** from the menu

5. **Add a comment** if needed (the same comment dialog appears)

6. **Confirm** to restore the task
</Steps>

## Important considerations

### Hidden task data is preserved

Hidden tasks keep everything - form data, file attachments, comments, and assignments. When you show a task again, it's exactly as it was. Internally, Tallyfy sets hidden tasks to an `auto-skipped` status rather than deleting them.

### Manual overrides beat automation

If you manually hide a task, it stays hidden even when automation conditions change. For example: your automation would normally show a task when "Priority = High". You manually hid it. Someone changes priority to High. The task stays hidden. You'll need to manually show it again.

### How hiding affects your process

When you hide a task, it vanishes from everyone's [task views](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/). Your completion percentage recalculates - if you had 10 tasks and hide one, Tallyfy now tracks 9. Hidden tasks don't count against deadlines either.

## Best practices

**Add comments when hiding or showing tasks.** Tallyfy prompts you with a comment dialog for a reason. Six months later when someone asks "Why is the compliance task missing?" you'll have an answer.

**Review hidden tasks periodically.** They're easy to forget. If you're repeatedly hiding the same task type, that's a sign to update your template's [automation rules](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) instead.

**Use hiding for exceptions, not everyday scenarios.** If a simple automation rule update would solve the problem permanently, do that instead of manually hiding tasks each time.

## Example scenario

Your intake form asks "Business Type" - Corporation, LLC, Partnership, or Sole Proprietor. Each choice triggers different tasks via automation.

A client selects "Corporation" and moves forward. Corporate filing tasks appear. Ten minutes later: "Actually, we're an LLC."

They change their selection. The LLC tasks show up, but the corporate tasks remain visible too.

What to do:
1. Hide the corporate filing tasks using the three-dot menu
2. The LLC tasks are already visible thanks to automation
3. Add a comment: "Client switched from Corp to LLC during intake"

Your team now sees only LLC-relevant tasks. If the client changes their mind again, those hidden tasks are one click away.
