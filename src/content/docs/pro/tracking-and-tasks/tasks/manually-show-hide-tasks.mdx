## How to manually control task visibility

You can manually show or hide tasks in running processes to handle situations where conditional logic has made incorrect tasks visible or when you need to temporarily remove tasks from view. This gives you direct control over task visibility beyond automatic [automation rules](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/).

Manual task visibility control is particularly useful when users change their selections in forms that trigger conditional paths, as previously shown tasks remain visible by default.

## Prerequisites

- Administrator or Standard user role
- An active [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) with tasks
- Understanding of [task types](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-types-of-tasks-can-i-create-with-tallyfy/)

## When to use manual show/hide

Manual task visibility control helps in these scenarios:

- **Selection changes**: When a user changes their answer in a form field that triggers different conditional paths
- **Workflow corrections**: When automation rules create unexpected task visibility
- **Temporary removal**: When a task is no longer needed but you don't want to delete it permanently
- **Testing workflows**: When you need to verify different paths in a process

## How to manually hide a task

<Steps>
1. **Navigate to the process**: Open the running process containing the task you want to hide

2. **Find the task**: Locate the specific task in the process view

3. **Open task menu**: Click the **three dots (⋮)** menu on the task

4. **Select hide option**: Choose **Hide task** from the dropdown menu

5. **Add comment (optional)**: You may be prompted to add a comment explaining why you're hiding the task

6. **Confirm action**: Click **Hide** to remove the task from view
</Steps>

The task will immediately disappear from the regular task view but remains in the process history.

## How to manually show a hidden task

<Steps>
1. **Access hidden tasks**: In the process view, look for an option to view hidden tasks (this may be under a filter or view option)

2. **Find the hidden task**: Locate the task you want to make visible again

3. **Open task menu**: Click the **three dots (⋮)** menu on the hidden task

4. **Select show option**: Choose **Show task** from the menu

5. **Add comment (optional)**: Explain why you're making the task visible again

6. **Confirm action**: Click **Show** to restore task visibility
</Steps>

## Important considerations

### Task state preservation
- Hidden tasks maintain their completion status and data
- Any information entered in hidden tasks is preserved
- Task assignments remain intact when hidden

### Automation interactions
- Manual visibility overrides automation rules
- If automation conditions change, manually hidden tasks stay hidden
- You must manually show tasks even if automation conditions would normally display them

### Process tracking
- Hidden tasks don't appear in standard [task views](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/)
- Process completion percentage adjusts when tasks are hidden
- Hidden tasks are excluded from deadline calculations

## Best practices

1. **Document reasons**: Always add comments when hiding/showing tasks to maintain process history
2. **Review regularly**: Periodically check for hidden tasks that might need attention
3. **Train your team**: Ensure team members understand when to use manual controls vs relying on automation
4. **Consider automation first**: Before manually hiding tasks, verify if your automation rules need adjustment

## Common use case example

**Scenario**: A form asks "Business Type" with options for Corporation, LLC, Partnership, and Sole Proprietor. Each type triggers different documentation tasks.

**Problem**: User initially selects "Corporation" which shows corporate filing tasks. They then change to "LLC" but the corporate tasks remain visible.

**Solution**: 
1. Manually hide the corporate filing tasks that are no longer relevant
2. The LLC tasks appear automatically based on the new selection
3. Add a comment explaining the business type change for audit trail

This ensures users only see relevant tasks for their current selection.
