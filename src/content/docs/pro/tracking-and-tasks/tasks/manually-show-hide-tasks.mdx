## How to manually control task visibility

Click the **three dots (⋮)** menu on any task and select **Hide task** or **Show task** to control visibility in running processes. Simple as that.

You'll use this feature when someone changes their mind halfway through a form - maybe they switch from "Corporation" to "LLC" and now you've got irrelevant corporate filing tasks hanging around. Or when your [automation rules](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) didn't quite predict this specific scenario. Manual visibility control puts you back in charge.

## Prerequisites

- Administrator or Standard user role
- An active [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) with tasks
- Understanding of [task types](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-types-of-tasks-can-i-create-with-tallyfy/)

## When to use manual show/hide

Most users discover this feature after their first "oh no" moment. You know the one - someone picks Option A, fills out three tasks, then realizes they meant Option B. The old tasks? Still there, confusing everyone.

Here's when you'll reach for manual visibility:

- **Mid-process pivots**: Customer changes from "New Installation" to "Upgrade" after starting the process (happens more than you'd think)
- **Automation hiccups**: Your perfectly crafted rules show tasks that shouldn't be there - yet
- **Quick fixes**: That compliance task isn't needed for this specific client, but you can't delete it from the template
- **Testing scenarios**: You're walking through different process paths without launching 15 separate test runs

## How to manually hide a task

Let's hide that unnecessary task:

<Steps>
1. **Open your running process** - the one with the task that shouldn't be there

2. **Find the troublesome task** in your process view (it's probably staring at you right now)

3. **Click the three dots (⋮)** on the task card - this opens your task menu

4. **Select Hide task** from the dropdown. Can't miss it.

5. **Add a quick note** about why you're hiding it (optional but smart - future you will thank present you)

6. **Click Hide** and watch it vanish
</Steps>

Gone. The task disappears from view but Tallyfy keeps it in the process history - nothing gets lost.

## How to manually show a hidden task

Changed your mind? Need that task back? Here's the rescue mission:

<Steps>
1. **Look for the hidden tasks filter** in your process view - might be under view options or filters (depends on your setup)

2. **Spot your hidden task** among the other hidden items

3. **Click those three dots (⋮)** again on the hidden task

4. **Choose Show task** from the menu

5. **Drop a comment** explaining the reversal (again, optional but helpful)

6. **Hit Show** - welcome back, task!
</Steps>

## Important considerations

### What happens to hidden task data?

Nothing. That's the beauty of it.

Hidden tasks keep everything - completion status, form data, file attachments, comments. If someone spent 20 minutes filling out a task before you hid it, their work is safe. The assignments stick too. When you unhide the task three days later, it's exactly as it was.

### Manual vs automation - who wins?

You do. Manual visibility always beats automation rules.

Here's what catches people: If you manually hide a task, it stays hidden even when automation conditions change. Let's say your automation would normally show a task when "Priority = High". You manually hid it. Someone changes priority to High. Task stays hidden. You'll need to manually show it again.

### How hiding affects your process

The moment you hide a task, a few things happen. First, it vanishes from everyone's [task views](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/). Your completion percentage recalculates - if you had 10 tasks and hide one, you're now tracking 9. Smart move: hidden tasks don't count against deadlines either. No more red warnings for tasks that shouldn't exist.

## Best practices

After working with hundreds of teams using manual visibility, here's what works:

**Leave breadcrumbs.** Add a comment when you hide or show tasks. Six months later when someone asks "Why is the compliance task missing from the Johnson account?" you'll have an answer. Takes 5 seconds, saves 30 minutes of detective work.

**Check your hidden tasks weekly.** Set a reminder. Hidden tasks have a way of being forgotten - and sometimes they shouldn't stay hidden forever. One client discovered 47 hidden tasks across their processes. Turns out their automation rules needed tweaking, not manual overrides.

**Train your power users first.** Not everyone needs to know about manual visibility. But your process champions? They should understand when to use it versus fixing the automation. Quick rule: If you're hiding the same task type repeatedly, update your template automation instead.

**Think twice before hiding.** Sometimes the real issue is your automation logic. We see teams manually hiding tasks every day when a simple automation rule update would solve it permanently. Manual control is powerful - use it for exceptions, not everyday scenarios.

## Common use case example

Here's the classic scenario that drives everyone crazy:

You're onboarding a new client. The intake form asks "Business Type" - Corporation, LLC, Partnership, or Sole Proprietor. Each choice triggers different paperwork tasks.

Your client confidently selects "Corporation" and moves forward. Corporate filing tasks appear. Articles of incorporation. Board resolutions. The works.

Ten minutes later: "Actually, we're an LLC."

They change their selection, and yes, the LLC tasks show up. But those corporate tasks? Still sitting there, confusing everyone. "Do we need board resolutions?" No. "Why is it asking for articles of incorporation?" 

You know what to do:
1. Hide those corporate filing tasks - they're not wrong, just irrelevant now
2. The LLC tasks are already there thanks to your automation
3. Add a quick comment: "Client switched from Corp to LLC during intake"

Done. Your team sees only LLC-relevant tasks. No confusion, no wasted time on corporate paperwork they don't need. And if the client changes their mind again? (It happens.) Those hidden tasks are one click away.
