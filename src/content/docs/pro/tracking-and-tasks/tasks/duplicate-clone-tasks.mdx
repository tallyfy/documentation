## How to duplicate steps

You can duplicate any step in a Tallyfy template to create a copy with the same settings, form fields, and assignments - minus comments and historical data. This saves time when multiple steps share most of their configuration.

Useful when you're creating multiple approval steps, collecting the same data at different stages, or any time steps share most of their setup.

## Prerequisites

- Admin or Standard user role (Light members can't duplicate)
- A [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in edit mode
- An existing step to duplicate

## How to duplicate a step in templates

<Steps>
1. **Open your template** - click **Edit** to enter edit mode

2. **Click the step** you want to duplicate to open its detail panel

3. **Click the copy icon** - in the step detail panel, click the **Duplicate Step** icon (copy icon)

4. The cloned step appears directly after the original, positioned at original position + 1

5. **Edit the clone** - update the name, assignee, and any fields that differ from the original
</Steps>

## What gets copied

### Copied
- Step name (appended with " - Copy")
- Step type (task, approval, expiring, email, or expiring email)
- All form fields and their settings
- Description and instructions
- Deadline settings
- Assignees, groups, and guest assignments
- Tags
- Webhook settings
- Advanced settings

### Not copied
- Comments
- Completion status
- Historical data
- Internal IDs (new ones are generated)

## Best practices

1. **Rename right away** - get rid of the " - Copy" suffix. Stacking copies like "Task Name - Copy - Copy" gets confusing fast

2. **Check assignments** - the clone inherits assignees, groups, and guests from the original. Verify they're correct for the new step

3. **Review form fields** - copied fields might need different labels or options for the new context

4. **Check step order** - clones land right after the original. Drag them to the correct position in your workflow

## Example: multiple department approvals

Need Finance, Legal, and Operations to each approve something?

1. Build the Finance approval step with all fields
2. Duplicate it twice
3. Rename to "Legal Approval" and "Operations Approval"
4. Change assignees for each department
5. Add any department-specific fields - maybe Legal needs a compliance checkbox

## Tips

- **Perfect the original first** - fixing the same typo across 10 duplicated steps isn't fun
- **Use variables** - set up [variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/) in your original step so all clones pull from shared data
