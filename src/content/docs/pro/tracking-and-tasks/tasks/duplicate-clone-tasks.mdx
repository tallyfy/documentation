## How to duplicate tasks

Tallyfy allows you to duplicate (clone) existing tasks to quickly create similar tasks without starting from scratch. When you clone a task, all settings, form fields, and configurations are copied except for comments, giving you a clean starting point for the new task.

Task duplication is perfect for creating multiple similar approval steps, repetitive form collections, or any scenario where tasks share most of their configuration.

## Prerequisites

- Administrator or Standard user role  
- A [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in edit mode
- An existing task to duplicate

## When to use task duplication

Task cloning helps in these common scenarios:

- **Multiple approvals**: Creating several approval tasks with similar fields but different approvers
- **Repeated data collection**: Setting up multiple tasks that collect similar information at different process stages
- **Parallel workflows**: Creating tasks for different team members that need the same instructions and fields
- **Template variations**: Building similar processes faster by cloning and modifying existing tasks

## How to duplicate a task in templates

<Steps>
1. **Open your template**: Navigate to the template and click **Edit** to enter edit mode

2. **Find the task to clone**: Locate the task you want to duplicate in your template

3. **Access task options**: Click the **three dots (â‹®)** menu on the task

4. **Select clone**: Choose **Clone task** or **Duplicate task** from the menu

5. **Position the new task**: The cloned task appears directly after the original task

6. **Modify as needed**: Edit the cloned task's name, assignee, and any fields that differ from the original
</Steps>

## What gets copied when cloning

### Copied elements
- Task name (with "Copy of" prefix)
- Task type (regular, approval, email, etc.)
- All form fields and their settings
- Task description and instructions  
- Deadline settings
- Assignment rules
- Automation rules affecting the task
- Advanced settings

### Not copied
- Task comments
- Task completion status
- Historical data
- Task-specific IDs or references

## Best practices for task duplication

1. **Rename immediately**: Always rename cloned tasks to avoid confusion with names like "Copy of Task Name"

2. **Update assignments**: Review and update task assignments since the clone inherits the original's assignment rules

3. **Verify form fields**: Check that copied form fields have appropriate field names for data collection

4. **Test automations**: If the original task had automation rules, verify they work correctly with the cloned task

5. **Consider task order**: After cloning, drag tasks to reorder them in your workflow sequence

## Common use case examples

### Example 1: Multiple department approvals
You need approval from Finance, Legal, and Operations with similar approval forms:
1. Create the Finance approval task with all necessary fields
2. Clone it twice
3. Rename clones to "Legal Approval" and "Operations Approval"  
4. Update assignees to respective department heads
5. Adjust any department-specific fields

### Example 2: Multi-location data collection
Collecting the same inventory data from 5 warehouse locations:
1. Build the complete inventory form for Location A
2. Clone the task 4 times
3. Rename each for locations B through E
4. Update location-specific details and assignees

### Example 3: Parallel task assignments
Assigning the same quality check to 3 different inspectors:
1. Create the quality check task with all criteria
2. Clone twice for the other inspectors
3. Update assignees while keeping all check criteria identical

## Tips for efficient cloning

- **Build once, clone many**: Perfect your task before cloning to avoid fixing the same issue multiple times
- **Use variables**: Set up [variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/) in the original task so clones can reference shared data
- **Clone groups**: If you have a set of related tasks, clone them as a group to maintain their relationships
