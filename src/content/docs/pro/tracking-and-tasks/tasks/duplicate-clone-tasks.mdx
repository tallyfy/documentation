## How to duplicate tasks

Want to create similar tasks without all the repetitive setup? Just clone them. Tallyfy lets you duplicate existing tasks - complete with all their settings, form fields, and configurations (except comments). It's like having a fresh copy to work with.

This feature really shines when you're creating multiple approval steps, collecting the same data at different stages, or basically any time tasks share most of their configuration. Think of it as your workflow copy machine.

## Prerequisites

- Administrator or Standard user role  
- A [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in edit mode
- An existing task to duplicate

## When to use task duplication

You'll find yourself reaching for the clone button in these situations:

- **Multiple approvals**: Need Finance, Legal, and Operations to all approve something? Clone that first approval task instead of rebuilding it three times
- **Repeated data collection**: Collecting inventory data from 5 warehouses? Create one perfect form, then clone it for each location
- **Parallel workflows**: When different team members need the same task with identical instructions - why type it all again?
- **Template variations**: Building similar processes becomes way faster when you start with a working template and tweak from there

## How to duplicate a task in templates

<Steps>
1. **Open your template**: Navigate to the template and click **Edit** to enter edit mode

2. **Find the task to clone**: Locate the task you want to duplicate in your template

3. **Access task options**: Click the **three dots (â‹®)** menu on the task

4. **Select clone**: Choose **Clone task** or **Duplicate task** from the menu

5. **Position the new task**: The cloned task appears directly after the original task

6. **Modify as needed**: Edit the cloned task's name, assignee, and any fields that differ from the original
</Steps>

## What gets copied when cloning

### Copied elements
Here's what comes along for the ride:
- Task name (you'll see "Copy of" in front - we'll talk about renaming in a bit)
- Task type (whether it's a regular task, approval, email task, etc.)
- All form fields and their settings
- Task description and instructions  
- Deadline settings
- Assignment rules
- Any automation rules that affect the task
- Advanced settings

### Not copied
These stay behind with the original:
- Task comments
- Task completion status
- Historical data
- Task-specific IDs or references

Makes sense, right? You get a clean slate with all the configuration intact.

## Best practices for task duplication

1. **Rename immediately**: First thing - get rid of that "Copy of Task Name" label. Nobody wants a template full of "Copy of Copy of Approval Task"

2. **Update assignments**: The clone inherits all assignment rules from the original. Double-check who's getting assigned what

3. **Verify form fields**: Make sure those copied form fields still make sense for your new task. Field names matter for data collection

4. **Test automations**: Got automation rules on the original? Test them. Sometimes cloned tasks need their own automation tweaks

5. **Consider task order**: Clones appear right after the original. Drag them where they actually belong in your workflow

## Common use case examples

### Example 1: Multiple department approvals
Let's say you need Finance, Legal, and Operations to all approve a new vendor. Same approval form, different people. Here's the play:
1. Build out that Finance approval task with all the fields you need
2. Clone it twice - boom, instant copies
3. Rename them to "Legal Approval" and "Operations Approval" (no more "Copy of" confusion)
4. Switch the assignees to each department head
5. Tweak any department-specific fields - maybe Legal needs an extra compliance checkbox

Simple.

### Example 2: Multi-location data collection
Picture this: You're collecting inventory data from 5 warehouses. Same exact form for each location. Don't build it five times!
1. Create your perfect inventory form for Location A
2. Hit clone 4 times
3. Rename each clone for locations B through E
4. Update the location details and who's responsible at each site

That's 20 minutes of work instead of 2 hours.

### Example 3: Parallel task assignments
Three quality inspectors need to check the same things? Clone to the rescue:
1. Set up the quality check task with all your criteria
2. Clone it twice
3. Just change the assignees - everything else stays identical

Each inspector gets their own task, but you only built it once.

## Tips for efficient cloning

- **Build once, clone many**: Get that first task perfect before you start cloning. Trust me - fixing the same typo in 10 cloned tasks is nobody's idea of fun
- **Use variables**: Here's a pro move - set up [variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/) in your original task. Then all your clones can pull from the same shared data. Change it once, updates everywhere
- **Clone groups**: Got a whole sequence of related tasks? You can clone them as a group and keep all their relationships intact. Way faster than rebuilding complex workflows
