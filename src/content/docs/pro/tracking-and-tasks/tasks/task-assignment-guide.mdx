## Complete guide to task assignment options

Proper task assignment is crucial for workflow efficiency in Tallyfy. This guide explains all task assignment options and provides best practices to ensure the right people are working on the right tasks at the right time.

### Task assignment types

Tallyfy offers several ways to assign tasks to ensure flexibility in your workflows:

#### 1. Direct assignment to specific members

Assign tasks directly to specific members of your organization:

- **Individual assignment**: Assign to a specific person by name
- **Multiple assignees**: Assign to multiple people who all need to complete the task
- **Sequential assignment**: Set primary and backup assignees in order

#### 2. Role-based assignment

Assign tasks to roles instead of specific individuals:

- **Job title assignment**: Assign to a job title (e.g., "HR Manager")
- **Dynamic role assignment**: Assign based on who completed a previous task
- **Group-based assignment**: Assign to members of a specific group

#### 3. Guest assignment

Assign tasks to people outside your organization:

- **Email-based assignment**: Assign to any email address
- **Guest link sharing**: Create a link that anyone can use to complete a task
- **Guest form submission**: Allow guests to submit forms without having an account

### How to assign tasks

#### Assigning tasks in templates

When creating or editing a template:

1. Select a step in your template
2. Click on the **Assignment** tab
3. Choose the assignment type from the dropdown menu
4. Select specific assignees or roles as needed
5. Configure additional options like due dates or notifications

#### Reassigning tasks in active processes

To reassign a task in an active process:

1. Navigate to the task in the active process
2. Click the **Reassign** button
3. Select the new assignee
4. Add a comment explaining the reassignment if needed
5. Click **Save** to confirm

### Advanced assignment features

Tallyfy offers advanced assignment capabilities for complex workflows:

#### Conditional assignments

Set up rules to automatically assign tasks based on specific conditions:

- Assign based on form field values
- Change assignees based on process variables
- Route tasks dynamically based on business rules

#### Bulk assignment

Manage assignments for multiple tasks at once:

- Reassign all tasks from one person to another
- Update assignments across multiple processes
- Manage team workloads efficiently

#### Assignment notifications

Configure how assignees are notified:

- Email notifications when tasks are assigned
- Custom notification messages
- Reminder settings for upcoming and overdue tasks

### Best practices for task assignment

Follow these practices to make the most of Tallyfy's assignment capabilities:

- **Be specific**: Clearly define who needs to do what
- **Use role-based assignments** when possible to make templates more flexible
- **Set reasonable deadlines** for task completion
- **Include clear instructions** so assignees understand what's expected
- **Avoid overloading** individuals with too many concurrent tasks
- **Consider expertise and workload** when assigning tasks
- **Use backup assignees** for critical tasks to prevent bottlenecks
- **Review and adjust** assignments based on performance data

### Troubleshooting common assignment issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Unassigned tasks | Set default assignees in templates or use required assignments |
| Reassignment needed | Enable task reassignment permissions for team leads |
| Assignee unavailable | Set up backup assignees or use role-based assignment |
| Unclear responsibilities | Use detailed task descriptions and clear assignment labels |
| Too many notifications | Configure notification settings to reduce email volume |
| Guest can't access task | Check guest permissions and resend invitation if needed |

### Task assignment examples

Here are some real-world examples of effective task assignment strategies:

**Example 1: Approval workflow**
- Initial submission: Assigned to department members (role-based)
- First approval: Assigned to department manager (job title)
- Final approval: Assigned to specific executive (direct assignment)

**Example 2: Customer onboarding**
- Document collection: Assigned to the customer (guest assignment)
- Document verification: Assigned to onboarding specialist (direct assignment)
- Account setup: Assigned to IT department (group assignment)
- Welcome call: Assigned to the sales representative who won the account (dynamic assignment)

Effective task assignment ensures workflows run smoothly and everyone knows exactly what they need to do, improving overall productivity and process outcomes.
