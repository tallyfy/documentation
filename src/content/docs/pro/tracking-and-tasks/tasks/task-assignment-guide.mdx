## Task assignment in Tallyfy

Tallyfy supports three main assignment types: members, groups, and guests. You can assign one or many people to any task.

### Assignment types

#### Member assignment

Assign tasks to specific people in your organization:

- **Individual** - pick a specific person by name
- **Multiple assignees** - assign several people, optionally requiring all of them to complete the task (using the `everyone_must_complete` setting)
- **Assign to process starter** - automatically assign to whoever launched the process (the `assign_run_starter` option on a step)

#### Group assignment

Assign tasks to a group instead of individual people. When you assign a group, all members of that group become assignees. You can also set `max_assignable` to limit how many people from the group can pick up the task.

#### Guest assignment

Assign tasks to people outside your organization by entering their email address. Tallyfy sends them a link to complete their task - no account required. Guests can fill out form fields and submit data on tasks assigned to them.

### Assigning tasks in templates

When editing a template step:

1. Select a step in your template
2. Open the assignment dropdown
3. Choose the assignment type (member, group, or guest)
4. Pick specific assignees
5. Optionally configure `everyone_must_complete`, `can_complete_only_assignees`, or `max_assignable`

### Reassigning tasks in active processes

You can change task assignees in a running process by editing the task's owners. Admins can reassign any task. To reassign:

1. Open the task in the active process
2. Edit the assignees
3. Select the new assignee (member, group, or guest email)
4. Save changes

Tallyfy automatically notifies newly added assignees by email.

### Automation rules for assignment

Tallyfy's automation rules (automated actions) can change task assignments based on conditions. The available assignment actions are:

- **assign** - add assignees to a step
- **assign_only** - replace all current assignees with new ones
- **unassign** - remove specific assignees
- **clear_assignees** - remove all assignees from a step

Conditions can be based on form field values or step completion status. This lets you route tasks dynamically - for example, assigning a review step to a specific manager based on a dropdown selection in a previous step.

### Bulk reassignment

When removing a user from your organization, Tallyfy's `ReassignInformation` service lets you reassign all their templates, steps, processes, and tasks to another user in one operation. You can also update multiple task assignments at once within a single process using the bulk update feature.

### Troubleshooting assignment issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Unassigned tasks | Set default assignees on template steps or use `assign_run_starter` |
| Assignee unavailable | Use group assignment so other group members can pick up the task |
| Guest can't access task | Verify the guest email is correct and resend the task notification |
| Too many people assigned | Set `max_assignable` on the step to limit assignees |

### Example assignment strategies

**Approval workflow**
- Submission: assigned to a group (e.g., department members)
- Review: assigned to a specific person (e.g., department manager)
- Final approval: assigned to an executive (direct assignment)

**Customer onboarding**
- Document collection: assigned to the customer (guest by email)
- Verification: assigned to an onboarding specialist (direct)
- Account setup: assigned to the IT group (group assignment)
- Welcome call: assigned dynamically via an automation rule based on a form field value
