This comprehensive guide explains all available task assignment options and provides proven best practices for ensuring appropriate people receive relevant tasks at optimal timing. Effective task assignment directly impacts team productivity, process completion rates, and organizational efficiency.

### What task assignment types does Tallyfy support?
