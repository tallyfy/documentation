## Task assignment in Tallyfy

### What task assignment types does Tallyfy support?

Tallyfy gives you several ways to assign tasks that work for different types of organizations and workflows:

#### How does direct assignment to specific members work?

Assign tasks directly to specific members of your organization:

- **Individual assignment**: Assign to a specific person by name
- **Multiple assignees**: Assign to multiple people who all need to complete the task
- **Sequential assignment**: Set primary and backup assignees in order

#### How does role-based assignment work?

Assign tasks to roles instead of specific individuals:

- **Job title assignment**: Assign to a job title (e.g., "HR Manager")
- **Dynamic role assignment**: Assign based on who completed a previous task
- **Group-based assignment**: Assign to members of a specific group

#### How does guest assignment work?

Assign tasks to people outside your organization:

- **Email-based assignment**: Assign to any email address
- **Guest link sharing**: Create a link that anyone can use to complete a task
- **Guest form submission**: Allow guests to submit forms without having an account

### How can I assign tasks in Tallyfy?

#### How do I assign tasks in templates?

When creating or editing a template:

1. Select a step in your template
2. Click on the **Assignment** tab
3. Choose the assignment type from the dropdown menu
4. Select specific assignees or roles as needed
5. Configure additional options like due dates or notifications

#### How do I reassign tasks in active processes?

Who can reassign tasks depends on your role and the specific task. **Administrators**: Can reassign any task to anyone. To reassign a task (if you have permission):

1. Navigate to the task in the active process
2. Click the **Reassign** button
3. Select the new assignee
4. Add a comment explaining the reassignment if needed
5. Click **Save** to confirm

If you need a task reassigned but don't have permission, add a comment to the task requesting reassignment and tag an administrator or HR team member

### What advanced assignment features are available?

Tallyfy offers advanced assignment capabilities for complex workflows:

#### How do conditional assignments work?

Set up rules to automatically assign tasks based on specific conditions:

- Assign based on form field values
- Change assignees based on process variables
- Route tasks dynamically based on business rules

#### How can I use bulk assignment?

Manage assignments for multiple tasks at once:

- Reassign all tasks from one person to another
- Update assignments across multiple processes
- Manage team workloads efficiently

#### How do assignment notifications work?

Configure how assignees are notified:

- Email notifications when tasks are assigned
- Custom notification messages
- Reminder settings for upcoming and overdue tasks

### What are best practices for task assignment?

Follow these practices to make the most of Tallyfy's assignment capabilities:

- **Be specific**: Clearly define who needs to do what
- **Use role-based assignments** when possible to make templates more flexible
- **Set reasonable deadlines** for task completion
- **Include clear instructions** so assignees understand what's expected
- **Avoid overloading** individuals with too many concurrent tasks
- **Consider expertise and workload** when assigning tasks
- **Use backup assignees** for critical tasks to prevent bottlenecks
- **Review and adjust** assignments based on performance data

### How do I troubleshoot common assignment issues?

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Unassigned tasks | Set default assignees in templates or use required assignments |
| Reassignment needed | Enable task reassignment permissions for team leads |
| Assignee unavailable | Set up backup assignees or use role-based assignment |
| Unclear responsibilities | Use detailed task descriptions and clear assignment labels |
| Too many notifications | Configure notification settings to reduce email volume |
| Guest can't access task | Check guest permissions and resend invitation if needed |

### What are examples of effective task assignment strategies?

Here are some real-world examples of effective task assignment strategies:

**Example 1: Approval workflow**
- Initial submission: Assigned to department members (role-based)
- First approval: Assigned to department manager (job title)
- Final approval: Assigned to specific executive (direct assignment)

**Example 2: Customer onboarding**
- Document collection: Assigned to the customer (guest assignment)
- Document verification: Assigned to onboarding specialist (direct assignment)
- Account setup: Assigned to IT department (group assignment)
- Welcome call: Assigned to the sales representative who won the account (dynamic assignment)
