## Complete or reopen tasks

### How do I complete tasks in Tallyfy?

Complete [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in two ways - click the checkmark icon in any list view, or open the task and hit **Complete**.

<Steps>
1. **From list views (like Tasks or Tracker)**: Click the checkmark ✔️ icon to the left of the task name.
2. **From the task view**: Open the task, then click the **Complete** button (usually bottom right).

</Steps>

That's it. Task marked complete.

### How do I reopen completed tasks?

Need to undo a completion? Open the task and click **Re-Open**.

<Steps>
1. Open the completed task.
2. Click the **Re-Open** button.

</Steps>

The task goes back to active status.

### How can I control who completes or reopens tasks?

Restrict task completion and reopening to assigned members only with the **"Only assigned members can complete or edit this task"** setting in the [Advanced tab](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-can-i-utilize-tallyfys-advanced-tab-features/):

<Steps>
1. When editing the template, click the task step.
2. Go to the **Advanced** tab.
3. Switch **ON** the toggle **"Only assigned members can complete or edit this task"**.
</Steps>

When this is on:
* Only assigned people can complete the task
* Only assigned members can reopen it after completion
* Non-assignees won't see the **Complete** or **Re-Open** buttons
* Nobody can accidentally complete someone else's work

:::note[Admin override]
Admins can always complete, reopen, or edit any task - regardless of this setting.

### How do I complete tasks that have subtasks (checklists)?

Tasks with a checklist [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) work a bit differently. The checklist acts like mini subtasks you need to check off.

<Steps>
1. Open the task containing the checklist.
2. Check off subtasks as you complete them.
3. **Important** - check the checklist's completion rules (set in the template):
    * If it requires 'at least one' item checked - check at least one box.
    * If it requires 'all items' checked - check *every* box.
4. Once checklist rules and other required fields are met, the **Complete** button becomes available. Click it.
</Steps>

You can't complete a task until all required fields are filled out - including checklist requirements. The **Complete** button stays grayed out until everything's done.

:::caution[Unresolved issues block completion]
If a task has unresolved issues (problems), you can't complete it. Resolve all open issues first by adding a comment and marking them resolved.

:::tip[Learn more about checklists as subtasks]
See [Create and use subtasks (Checklist field)](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-create-and-use-subtasks/) for how to set these up.
