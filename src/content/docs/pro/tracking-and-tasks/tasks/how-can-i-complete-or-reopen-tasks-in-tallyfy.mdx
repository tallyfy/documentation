## Complete or reopen tasks

### How do I complete tasks in Tallyfy?

You can complete [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in two ways - either click the checkmark icon in any list view, or open the task and hit the **Complete** button. Here's how:

<Steps>
1. **From list views (like Tasks or Tracker)**: Click the checkmark ✔️ icon to the left of the task name.
2. **From the task view**: Open the task, then click the **Complete** button (usually bottom right).

</Steps>

That's it. Task marked complete.

### How can I reopen completed tasks?

Need to undo a completed task? Just open it and click **Re-Open**. 

<Steps>
1. Open the completed task.
2. Click the **Re-Open** button.

</Steps>

The task becomes active again.

### How can I control who completes or reopens tasks?

If you need to restrict task completion and reopening to only assigned members, use the **"Only assigned members can complete or edit this task"** setting in the [Advanced tab](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-can-i-utilize-tallyfys-advanced-tab-features/):

<Steps>
1. When editing the template, click the task step.
2. Go to the **Advanced** tab.
3. Switch **ON** the toggle **"Only assigned members can complete or edit this task"**.
</Steps>

Here's what happens when you turn this on:
* Only people assigned to the task can complete it
* Only assigned members can reopen the task after it's completed
* Non-assignees won't see the **Complete** or **Re-Open** buttons
* Nobody can accidentally (or intentionally) complete someone else's work

:::note[Admin override]
Administrators can always complete, reopen, or edit any task, regardless of this setting.

### How do I complete tasks that have subtasks (checklists)?

Got a task with a checklist? These work a bit differently. The checklist [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) acts like mini subtasks you need to check off.

<Steps>
1. Open the task containing the checklist.
2. Check off subtasks as you complete them.
3. **Important**: Note if the checklist has completion rules (set in the template):
    * If it requires 'at least one' item checked, make sure at least one box is checked.
    * If it requires 'all items' checked, make sure *every* box is checked.
4. Once the checklist rules (and other required fields) are met, the main **Complete** button becomes available. Click it to complete the main task.
</Steps>

You can't complete the main task until all its required fields are filled out - including any checklist requirements. The **Complete** button stays grayed out until everything's done.
