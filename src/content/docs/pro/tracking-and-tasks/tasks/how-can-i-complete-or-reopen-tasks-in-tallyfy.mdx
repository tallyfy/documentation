## How can I complete or reopen tasks in Tallyfy?

### How do I complete tasks in Tallyfy?

Tallyfy provides two efficient methods for marking [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) complete, accommodating different workflow preferences and contexts:

<Steps>
1. **From list views (like Tasks or Tracker)**: Click the checkmark ✔️ icon to the left of the task name.
2. **From the task view**: Open the task, then click the **Complete** button (usually bottom right).

</Steps>

Once completed, the task's status updates.

### How can I reopen completed tasks?

When circumstances require undoing task completion or reactivating previously finished work, Tallyfy enables straightforward task reopening:

<Steps>
1. Open the completed task.
2. Click the **Re-Open** button.

</Steps>

The task becomes active again.

### How do I complete tasks that have subtasks (checklists)?

Some tasks might have a checklist [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) acting like subtasks.

<Steps>
1. Open the task containing the checklist.
2. Check off subtasks as you complete them.
3. **Important**: Note if the checklist has completion rules (set in the template):
    * If it requires 'at least one' item checked, make sure at least one box is checked.
    * If it requires 'all items' checked, make sure *every* box is checked.
4. Once the checklist rules (and other required fields) are met, the main **Complete** button becomes available. Click it to complete the main task.
</Steps>

You can't complete the main task until all its required fields, including any checklist requirements, are met. This validation ensures thorough task completion and maintains workflow integrity.
