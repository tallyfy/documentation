## Completing tasks with subtasks

Some [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) may contain subtasks in the form of Checklist [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/). Follow these steps to complete them:

<Steps>
1. Open the task to view the checklist of subtasks.
2. Check off each subtask as you complete it.
3. Verify the checklist's validation requirements are met. (Checklist validation is set in the template editor).
4. If the checklist requires "at least one" item, ensure you have checked one or more subtasks.
5. If the checklist requires "all items," ensure you have checked every subtask.
6. Once the checklist requirements are satisfied (along with any other required fields in the task), click the **Complete** button for the main task.
</Steps>

Note that you cannot complete a task until all required form fields, including checklists with validation, are properly filled out.
