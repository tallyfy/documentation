## How to complete and reopen tasks

To complete a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), you have two options:

Option 1:

- Click on the checkmark to the left of your task.

Option 2:

- Open your desired task and select **Complete**.

Now, your task will be marked as _Completed_. If you need to reopen a task, simply select **Re-Open** to reverse it.

## Completing tasks with subtasks

Some [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) may contain subtasks in the form of Checklist [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/). For these tasks:

<Steps>
1. Open the task to view the checklist of subtasks
2. Check off each subtask as you complete it
3. Depending on the validation settings, you may need to:
   - Check at least one item (if configured with "at least one" validation)
   - Check all items (if configured with "all items required" validation)
4. Once the validation requirements are met, you can mark the entire task as complete
</Steps>

Note that you cannot complete a task until all required form fields, including checklists with validation, are properly filled out.
