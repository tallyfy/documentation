## How to complete and reopen tasks

To complete a task, you have two simple options:

Option 1:

- Click on the checkmark to the left of your task.

Option 2:

- Open your desired task and select **Complete**.

Now, your task will be marked as _Completed_. Awesome job! But what if you need to reopen a task? No worries! Simply select **Re-Open** to reverse it.

## Completing tasks with subtasks

Some tasks may contain subtasks in the form of Checklist form fields. For these tasks:

1. Open the task to view the checklist of subtasks
2. Check off each subtask as you complete it
3. Depending on the validation settings, you may need to:
   - Check at least one item (if configured with "at least one" validation)
   - Check all items (if configured with "all items required" validation)
4. Once the validation requirements are met, you can mark the entire task as complete

Note that you cannot complete a task until all required form fields, including checklists with validation, are properly filled out.
