## How to add, edit, and delete comments on tasks

Comments let you and your team discuss specific [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) directly within Tallyfy.

### Adding a comment

<Steps>
1. Open the task you want to comment on.
2. Scroll down to the **Comments** section.
3. Type your message. You can use the [rich text editor](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/edit-task/how-can-i-use-tallyfys-rich-text-editor-for-tasks/) to add formatting, files, images, etc.
4. Click **Post**.
5. Your comment appears with your name and the time.
</Steps>

[Guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) assigned to a task can also add comments to that specific task.

### Editing your own comments

To fix a typo or change what you wrote:

<Steps>
1. Find your comment.
2. Click the **Edit** button (pencil icon ‚úèÔ∏è) on your comment.
3. Edit your comment.
4. Click **Save**.
5. Your comment will show "(edited)" next to the timestamp.
</Steps>

### Deleting your comments

To remove a comment you posted:

<Steps>
1. Find your comment.
2. Click the **Delete** button (trash can icon üóëÔ∏è) on your comment.
3. Confirm the deletion.
4. The comment will be permanently deleted.
</Steps>

### Getting notified (@mentions)

To ensure a specific person sees your comment, type `@` and start typing their name (e.g., `@Jane Doe`). Select their name from the list that appears. They'll get a notification about your comment.

:::warning[Mentioning grants visibility]
Be aware that if you @mention someone who does not already have access to the process, Tallyfy will automatically grant them visibility of the task and process. Only mention users who should have access.
:::

### Comment Visibility for Guests

By default, comments added by members are *not* visible to guests assigned to the task. To make a specific comment visible to a guest:

<Steps>
1.  Click the **Visibility** toggle (eye icon) on your posted comment.
2.  Switch it to **Visible to Guests**.
</Steps>

Guests can always see their *own* comments.

### Comment Reactions

You can react to comments using emojis by clicking the smiley face icon below a comment.

### Tips for good comments

*   Keep comments task-focused.
*   Use `@mentions` to direct questions to the right people.
*   Use formatting (like **bold** or lists) to make them clear.

### Enquire about status

When viewing tasks in list views (like the main Tasks view or within a process in Tracker view), you can often find an **Enquire about Status** option in the task's menu (usually three dots ‚ãÆ).

Clicking this automatically posts a comment to the task, asking for an update and mentioning the current assignees. It's a quick way to prompt for status without typing a comment manually.
