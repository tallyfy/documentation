## Comment management in Tallyfy

You can add, edit, and delete comments on any task in Tallyfy - just click the speech bubble icon or open the task to see the comments section. Type your message, use @mentions to notify teammates, and hit post.

### Add comments to tasks

<Steps>
1. Open the task you want to comment on.
2. Scroll down to the **Comments** section.
3. Type your message. You can use the [rich text editor](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/edit-task/how-can-i-use-tallyfys-rich-text-editor-for-tasks/) to add formatting, files, images, etc.
4. Click **Post**.
5. Your comment appears with your name and the time.
</Steps>

:::note[Guest Comments]
[Guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) assigned to a task can comment too - they just see their specific task, not the whole process.
:::

### Edit comments

<Steps>
1. Find your comment.
2. Click the **Edit** button (pencil icon ‚úèÔ∏è) on your comment.
3. Edit your comment.
4. Click **Save**.
5. Your comment will show "(edited)" next to the timestamp.
</Steps>

### Delete comments

<Steps>
1. Find your comment.
2. Click the **Delete** button (trash can icon üóëÔ∏è) on your comment.
3. Confirm the deletion.
4. The comment will be permanently deleted.
</Steps>

### Use @mentions

Type `@` and start typing their name (like `@Jane Doe`). Pick them from the dropdown that appears. They'll get a notification instantly.

:::warning[Mentioning grants visibility]
When you @mention someone who doesn't have access to the process yet, Tallyfy automatically gives them visibility. Only tag people who should actually see the work.
:::

### Guest visibility

Your team's comments are hidden from guests by default. To share a specific comment with a guest:

<Steps>
1.  Find the **Visibility** toggle (eye icon) on your posted comment.
2.  Switch it to **Visible to Guests**.
</Steps>

Guests can always see their own comments.

### Comment reactions

React to comments using emojis by clicking the smiley face icon below a comment.

### Effective commenting tips

*   Stay focused on the task at hand - save general discussions for process comments
*   @mention specific people when you need answers (they get notified instantly)
*   Use **bold** for key points or deadlines - it catches the eye
*   Include context: "Updated vendor list (see attachment)" beats just "Updated"

### Enquire about task status

When you're looking at tasks in any list view, click the three dots menu (‚ãÆ) and select **Enquire about Status**. Tallyfy posts a status request that @mentions whoever's assigned.
