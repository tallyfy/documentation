## Comment management in Tallyfy

Add, edit, and delete comments on any task in Tallyfy. Open the task, type your message, use @mentions to notify teammates, and post.

### Add comments to tasks

<Steps>
1. Open the task you want to comment on.
2. Scroll down to the **Comments** section.
3. Type your message. You can use the [rich text editor](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/edit-task/how-can-i-use-tallyfys-rich-text-editor-for-tasks/) to add formatting, files, images, etc.
4. Click **Post**.
</Steps>

Your comment appears with your name and timestamp.

:::note[Guest comments]
[Guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) assigned to a task can comment too - they only see their specific task, not the whole process.
:::

### Edit comments

You can only edit your own comments (unless you're an Admin).

<Steps>
1. Find your comment.
2. Click the **Edit** button (pencil icon) on your comment.
3. Make your changes.
4. Click **Save**.
</Steps>

### Delete comments

Only the comment author or an Admin can delete a comment. Deletion is permanent.

<Steps>
1. Find your comment.
2. Click the **Delete** button (trash icon) on your comment.
3. Confirm the deletion.
</Steps>

### Use @mentions

Type `@` followed by someone's name. Pick them from the dropdown. They'll get a notification instantly.

:::warning[Mentioning grants visibility]
When you @mention someone who doesn't have access to the process yet, Tallyfy automatically gives them visibility. Only tag people who should actually see the work.
:::

### Guest visibility

Comments are hidden from guests by default. When posting a comment, use the visibility dropdown (lock/unlock icon) to switch between **Hide from guest** and **Visible to everyone**.

Guests can always see their own comments.

### Comment reactions

React to any comment with emojis by clicking the reaction icon below it.

### Commenting tips

*   Stay focused on the task - save general discussions for process-level comments
*   @mention specific people when you need answers
*   Use **bold** for key points or deadlines
*   Include context: "Updated vendor list (see attachment)" beats just "Updated"

### Request task status

Click the three-dots menu (**...**) on a task and select **Request Status**. Tallyfy posts a comment that @mentions all assignees, asking for a status update.
