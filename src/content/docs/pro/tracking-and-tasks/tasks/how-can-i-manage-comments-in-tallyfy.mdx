## How can I manage comments in Tallyfy?

You can add, edit, and delete comments on any task in Tallyfy - just click the speech bubble icon or open the task to see the comments section. Type your message, use @mentions to notify teammates, and hit post. That's it.

Comments keep all your task discussions in one place, right where the work happens. No more hunting through emails or chat logs to find that important decision from last week.

### How do I add comments to Tallyfy tasks?

<Steps>
1. Open the task you want to comment on.
2. Scroll down to the **Comments** section.
3. Type your message. You can use the [rich text editor](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/edit-task/how-can-i-use-tallyfys-rich-text-editor-for-tasks/) to add formatting, files, images, etc.
4. Click **Post**.
5. Your comment appears with your name and the time.
</Steps>

:::note[Guest Comments]
[Guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) assigned to a task can comment too - they just see their specific task, not the whole process.

### How can I edit my own comments?

To fix a typo or change what you wrote:

<Steps>
1. Find your comment.
2. Click the **Edit** button (pencil icon ‚úèÔ∏è) on your comment.
3. Edit your comment.
4. Click **Save**.
5. Your comment will show "(edited)" next to the timestamp.
</Steps>

### How do I delete my comments?

To remove a comment you posted:

<Steps>
1. Find your comment.
2. Click the **Delete** button (trash can icon üóëÔ∏è) on your comment.
3. Confirm the deletion.
4. The comment will be permanently deleted.
</Steps>

### How can I get someone's attention with @mentions?

Need to get someone's attention? Type `@` and start typing their name (like `@Jane Doe`). Pick them from the dropdown that appears. They'll get a notification instantly.

Done.

:::warning[Mentioning grants visibility]
Here's the thing - when you @mention someone who doesn't have access to the process yet, Tallyfy automatically gives them visibility. It's helpful, but be careful. Only tag people who should actually see the work.

### How does comment visibility work for guests?

Here's something important - your team's comments are hidden from guests by default. Makes sense, right?

Want to share a specific comment with a guest? Easy:

<Steps>
1.  Find the **Visibility** toggle (eye icon) on your posted comment.
2.  Switch it to **Visible to Guests**.
</Steps>

Guests can always see their own comments, of course.

### How do comment reactions work?

You can react to comments using emojis by clicking the smiley face icon below a comment.

### What are tips for effective commenting?

After watching thousands of teams use comments, here's what actually works:

*   Stay focused on the task at hand - save general discussions for process comments
*   @mention specific people when you need answers (they get notified instantly)
*   Use **bold** for key points or deadlines - it catches the eye
*   Include context: "Updated vendor list (see attachment)" beats just "Updated"

### How can I enquire about task status?

Need an update on a task but don't want to seem pushy? Tallyfy's got you covered.

When you're looking at tasks in any list view, click the three dots menu (‚ãÆ) and look for **Enquire about Status**. One click, and Tallyfy posts a polite status request that @mentions whoever's assigned. 

No awkward "just checking in" messages needed.
