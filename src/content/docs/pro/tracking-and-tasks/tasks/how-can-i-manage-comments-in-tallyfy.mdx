## How to add, edit, and delete comments in tasks

Comments in Tallyfy facilitate team collaboration by enabling discussions directly within [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) and [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). This guide explains how to create, edit, and delete comments effectively.

### Adding comments

1. Navigate to the task or process where you want to add a comment
2. Scroll down to the **Comments** section at the bottom of the page
3. Type your message in the comment field
4. Click **Post** to publish your comment
5. Your comment will appear in the comments feed with your name and timestamp
</Steps>

### Editing comments

You can modify your own comments after posting:

<Steps>
1. Locate the comment you want to edit in the comments feed
2. Click the **Edit** button (pencil icon) in the top-right corner of your comment
3. Make your desired changes in the editing field
4. Click **Save** to update your comment
5. Your edited comment will display an "(edited)" indicator
</Steps>

If a comment is no longer relevant:

<Steps>
1. Find the comment you want to remove
2. Click the **Delete** button (trash icon) in the top-right corner of the comment
3. Confirm the deletion when prompted
4. The comment will be permanently removed from the comments feed
</Steps>

### Comment notifications

When you're mentioned in a comment or someone comments on a task assigned to you:

- The comment will appear in your Tallyfy notifications

### Best practices for commenting

- Keep comments concise and relevant to the task
- Use @mentions to notify specific [team members](/products/pro/documenting/members/)
- Include links to relevant resources when applicable
- Use formatting options for clarity (bold, italics, bullet points)
- Reply directly to existing comments to maintain conversation threads
