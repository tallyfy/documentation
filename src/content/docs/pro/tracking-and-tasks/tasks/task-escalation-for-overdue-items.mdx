## Managing and escalating overdue tasks

Keeping track of overdue tasks and ensuring accountability is an important part of process management. Tallyfy is currently developing automatic escalation paths for overdue tasks, which will enable automatic comments or task reassignment when deadlines pass.

### Current status of automatic escalation features

Automatic escalation pathways for overdue tasks are on Tallyfy's development roadmap. This future enhancement will allow you to:

- Automatically add comments to overdue tasks
- Reassign tasks to managers or other team members when they become overdue
- Set up custom notification rules based on how overdue a task is

While we develop this feature, several effective workarounds exist to help you manage overdue tasks.

### Current workarounds for escalating overdue tasks

You have several options available now to help manage and track overdue tasks:

- **Add comments manually**: You can quickly add a comment on any overdue task to ask for status updates
- **Daily digest emails**: Every member already receives daily digest emails that highlight overdue tasks
- **Filter for overdue tasks**: Use the [Tracker view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/) and [Tasks view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/) to filter for overdue tasks only
- **Watch specific items**: You can "Watch" a process or a task to receive notifications for all changes made to it. Note that this currently does not generate a notification when a task becomes overdue

## Research on effective task follow-up approaches

Recent research across psychology and organizational studies offers valuable insights into effective approaches for managing overdue tasks.

### Summary of research findings

Research indicates that threat-based, status-driven notifications—such as blunt reminders that "this task is overdue"—reflect a controlling communication style that undermines intrinsic motivation, damages performance, and leads to more negative evaluations of employees. In contrast, autonomy-supportive approaches—offering informational feedback, asking open-ended questions about why a task is late, and providing context-sensitive, actor-specific reminders—have been shown to boost engagement, task completion, and well-being. These patterns hold across cultures and industries, underscoring the global applicability of supportive, contextual strategies for managing overdue work.

### Theoretical foundations

#### Self-Determination Theory (SDT)

Self-Determination Theory posits that fulfilling basic psychological needs—autonomy, competence, and relatedness—fosters autonomous motivation, while thwarting these needs via controlling practices leads to controlled motivation and amotivation. A large meta-analysis of SDT-based interventions confirms that controlled motivational contexts negatively affect engagement and well-being across educational and work settings.

#### Cognitive Evaluation Theory (CET)

Cognitive Evaluation Theory, a subtheory of SDT, distinguishes between **informational** feedback (which supports autonomy and competence) and **controlling** feedback (which undermines them). Empirical work shows that even positive feedback delivered in a controlling manner (e.g., "You must keep up this pace!") reduces intrinsic motivation, whereas informational feedback preserves or enhances it.

### Empirical evidence

#### Educational settings

In a seminal study, Butler & Nisan (1986) randomly assigned students to receive either non-threatening, task-related comments, normative grades, or no feedback. Those receiving **task-related comments** maintained higher intrinsic motivation and performed better on creative and analytic tasks, whereas **normative grades** (a controlling cue) did not sustain interest any more than no feedback.

#### Organizational settings

Hardré & Reeve (2009) trained 25 Fortune 500 managers in autonomy-supportive strategies (e.g., providing rationales, non-controlling language). Five weeks post-training, these managers exhibited markedly more supportive behaviors, and their 169 employees reported higher autonomous motivation and greater workplace engagement compared to a control group.

#### Modern technological interventions

Microsoft's **Nudge** system uses machine-learning models to predict which pull requests are likely to stall, identifies the actor blocking progress, and sends tailored reminders. In large-scale trials, Nudge reduced pull request resolution time by **60%** compared to generic overdue notifications, and **73%** of recipients perceived the reminders as useful.

### Practical recommendations

When following up on overdue tasks, consider these research-backed approaches:

- **Ask "Why?"** - Use open-ended questions (e.g., "Can you share what obstacles you've encountered?") to diagnose root causes and demonstrate empathy
- **Provide informational rationales** - Explain the importance and context of tasks (e.g., "Completing this report helps the team meet client expectations on time")
- **Use non-controlling language** - Avoid "must" or "should"; instead, frame suggestions as options or invitations (e.g., "You might consider…")
- **Tailor notifications with context** - When possible, personalize follow-ups rather than sending blanket overdue alerts
- **Train managers in autonomy-support** - Implement theory-based approaches to teach autonomy-supportive behaviors

By shifting from threat-based, status-driven reminders to supportive, informational approaches that respect team members' autonomy and competence, you can more effectively manage overdue tasks and foster a healthier, more motivated work culture.

## Best practices for following up on overdue tasks

While waiting for automated escalation features, you can implement these best practices for effective follow-up:

1. **Be consistent** - Check for overdue tasks at regular intervals
2. **Understand before acting** - Ask about barriers or blockers before assuming negligence
3. **Offer help** - When following up, ask if assistance is needed to move the task forward
4. **Document follow-ups** - Use [comments](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-can-i-manage-comments-in-tallyfy/) to maintain a record of all follow-up communications
5. **Set clear expectations** - When extending deadlines, establish new, realistic timeframes

:::tip[Reminder]
Remember that the most effective follow-ups focus on removing obstacles and providing support, not just pointing out that something is late.
