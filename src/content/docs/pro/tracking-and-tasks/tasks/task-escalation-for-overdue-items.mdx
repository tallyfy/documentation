title: Escalating overdue tasks

## Manage task escalation for overdue items

Without proper management, overdue tasks accumulate into [task debt](/products/pro/tutorials/how-to/how-to-avoid-task-debt/) that can overwhelm your team. Tallyfy is building automatic escalation features - automated comments, reassignments, and notifications when deadlines pass.

:::note[Understanding overdue tasks]
A task becomes overdue when it passes its **deadline** - the date and time when work should be **complete**. This is different from the start time, which suggests when work should **begin** on a task. Overdue status is determined solely by whether the deadline has passed, regardless of the start time.
:::

### Planned automatic escalation features

- Automatically add comments to overdue tasks
- Reassign tasks to managers or other team members when they become overdue
- Custom notification rules based on how overdue a task is

### Current workarounds for escalating overdue tasks

- **Add comments manually**: Add a comment on any overdue task to ask for status updates
- **Daily digest emails**: Every member receives daily digest emails that highlight overdue tasks
- **Filter for overdue tasks**: Use the [Tracker view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/) and [Tasks view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/) to filter for overdue tasks only
- **Watch specific items**: "Watch" a process or task to receive notifications for all changes. Note - this does not currently notify when a task becomes overdue

### Using expiring tasks as overdue automation triggers

An [expiring task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-types-of-tasks-can-i-create-with-tallyfy/) auto-completes when its deadline hits, which fires the [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) engine. You can use this to trigger any action - like adding an assignee to the real task - when a deadline passes.

**How to set it up**

1. Open your template in the Template Editor
2. Add a new step near the task you want to monitor and set its type to **Expiring**
3. Name it something like "Overdue trigger for [Task Name]"
4. Set the expiring step's deadline to match the task you're monitoring
5. Go to **Automations** and create a rule:
   - **IF**: Select the expiring step → condition **"is expired"**
   - **THEN**: Select **"Add assignees"** → choose the person or group → set **"Apply To"** to the actual task

The expiring step auto-completes at deadline, the automation fires, and the assignee gets added automatically.

**Things to keep in mind**

- The expiring step requires no action from anyone - it sits quietly until the deadline passes
- If someone acknowledges the expiring step before the deadline, the "is expired" condition won't fire - useful for cancelling the escalation
- Use "Replace assignees" instead of "Add assignees" to fully reassign rather than add someone
- Form field changes (like checking a checkbox) without completing the step won't trigger automations - the expiring task sidesteps this by completing automatically

## Research on effective task follow-up approaches

Threat-based reminders like "this task is overdue" undermine intrinsic motivation, damage performance, and lead to more negative evaluations. Autonomy-supportive approaches - informational feedback, open-ended questions, and context-sensitive reminders - boost engagement, task completion, and well-being across cultures and industries.

### Theoretical foundations

#### Self-Determination Theory (SDT)

Fulfilling basic psychological needs - autonomy, competence, and relatedness - fosters autonomous motivation. Controlling practices lead to amotivation. Meta-analyses confirm that controlled motivational contexts negatively affect engagement and well-being across educational and work settings.

#### Cognitive Evaluation Theory (CET)

CET, a subtheory of SDT, distinguishes between **informational** feedback (supports autonomy and competence) and **controlling** feedback (undermines them). Even positive feedback delivered in a controlling manner (e.g., "You must keep up this pace!") reduces intrinsic motivation.

### Empirical evidence

#### Educational settings

Butler & Nisan (1986) found that students receiving **task-related comments** maintained higher intrinsic motivation and performed better on creative and analytic tasks, whereas **normative grades** (a controlling cue) did not sustain interest any more than no feedback.

#### Organizational settings

Hardré & Reeve (2009) trained 25 Fortune 500 managers in autonomy-supportive strategies. Five weeks post-training, their 169 employees reported higher autonomous motivation and greater workplace engagement compared to a control group.

#### Modern technological interventions

Microsoft's **Nudge** system predicts which pull requests are likely to stall and sends tailored reminders. Nudge reduced resolution time by **60%** compared to generic overdue notifications, and **73%** of recipients found the reminders useful.

### Practical recommendations

- **Ask "Why?"** - Use open-ended questions (e.g., "What obstacles have you encountered?") to diagnose root causes
- **Provide rationales** - Explain task importance and context (e.g., "This report helps the team meet client expectations on time")
- **Use non-controlling language** - Frame suggestions as options, not demands (e.g., "You might consider..." instead of "You must...")
- **Personalize follow-ups** - Tailor notifications with context rather than sending blanket overdue alerts
- **Train managers in autonomy-support** - Teach autonomy-supportive behaviors through theory-based approaches

## Best practices for following up on overdue tasks

1. **Be consistent** - Check for overdue tasks at regular intervals
2. **Understand before acting** - Ask about barriers or blockers before assuming negligence
3. **Offer help** - Ask if assistance is needed to move the task forward
4. **Document follow-ups** - Use [comments](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-can-i-manage-comments-in-tallyfy/) to record all follow-up communications
5. **Set clear expectations** - When extending deadlines, establish new, realistic timeframes

:::tip[Reminder]
The most effective follow-ups focus on removing obstacles and providing support, not just pointing out that something is late.

## Preventing task debt before escalation

Prevent the problem rather than constantly escalating:

- **Use expiring tasks** for FYI items and optional information sharing - [expiring tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-types-of-tasks-can-i-create-with-tallyfy/) auto-complete at deadline, preventing buildup of non-critical overdue items
- **Bundle related work** into single tasks with multiple form fields instead of many small tasks
- **Set realistic deadlines** based on actual completion patterns, not optimistic estimates
- **Audit task necessity** regularly - remove tasks that consistently go overdue without consequences
