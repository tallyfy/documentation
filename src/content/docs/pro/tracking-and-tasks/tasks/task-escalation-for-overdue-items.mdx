## How can I manage task escalation for overdue items?

Keeping track of overdue tasks and making sure people stay accountable is a key part of managing Tallyfy processes well.

We're working on automatic escalation features for overdue tasks - think smart automated responses like adding comments and reassigning tasks when deadlines pass. This keeps workflows moving and people accountable.

:::note[Understanding overdue tasks]
A task becomes overdue when it passes its **deadline** - the date and time when work should be **complete**. This is different from the start time, which suggests when work should **begin** on a task. Overdue status is determined solely by whether the deadline has passed, regardless of the start time.

### What automatic escalation features is Tallyfy developing?

We've got some pretty cool automatic escalation features in the works for managing overdue tasks.

Here's what's coming:

- Automatically add comments to overdue tasks
- Reassign tasks to managers or other team members when they become overdue
- Set up custom notification rules based on how overdue a task is

In the meantime, there are several ways you can handle overdue tasks right now.

### Current workarounds for escalating overdue tasks

Here's what you can do today to manage and track overdue tasks:

- **Add comments manually**: You can quickly add a comment on any overdue task to ask for status updates
- **Daily digest emails**: Every member already receives daily digest emails that highlight overdue tasks
- **Filter for overdue tasks**: Use the [Tracker view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/) and [Tasks view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/) to filter for overdue tasks only
- **Watch specific items**: You can "Watch" a process or a task to receive notifications for all changes made to it. Note that this currently does not generate a notification when a task becomes overdue

## Research on effective task follow-up approaches

Recent research across psychology and organizational studies offers valuable insights into effective approaches for managing overdue tasks.

### Summary of research findings

Research indicates that threat-based, status-driven notifications—such as blunt reminders that "this task is overdue"—reflect a controlling communication style that undermines intrinsic motivation, damages performance, and leads to more negative evaluations of employees. In contrast, autonomy-supportive approaches—offering informational feedback, asking open-ended questions about why a task is late, and providing context-sensitive, actor-specific reminders—have been shown to boost engagement, task completion, and well-being. These patterns hold across cultures and industries, underscoring the global applicability of supportive, contextual strategies for managing overdue work.

### Theoretical foundations

#### Self-Determination Theory (SDT)

Self-Determination Theory posits that fulfilling basic psychological needs—autonomy, competence, and relatedness—fosters autonomous motivation, while thwarting these needs via controlling practices leads to controlled motivation and amotivation. A large meta-analysis of SDT-based interventions confirms that controlled motivational contexts negatively affect engagement and well-being across educational and work settings.

#### Cognitive Evaluation Theory (CET)

Cognitive Evaluation Theory, a subtheory of SDT, distinguishes between **informational** feedback (which supports autonomy and competence) and **controlling** feedback (which undermines them). Empirical work shows that even positive feedback delivered in a controlling manner (e.g., "You must keep up this pace!") reduces intrinsic motivation, whereas informational feedback preserves or enhances it.

### Empirical evidence

#### Educational settings

In a seminal study, Butler & Nisan (1986) randomly assigned students to receive either non-threatening, task-related comments, normative grades, or no feedback. Those receiving **task-related comments** maintained higher intrinsic motivation and performed better on creative and analytic tasks, whereas **normative grades** (a controlling cue) did not sustain interest any more than no feedback.

#### Organizational settings

Hardré & Reeve (2009) trained 25 Fortune 500 managers in autonomy-supportive strategies (e.g., providing rationales, non-controlling language). Five weeks post-training, these managers exhibited markedly more supportive behaviors, and their 169 employees reported higher autonomous motivation and greater workplace engagement compared to a control group.

#### Modern technological interventions

Microsoft's **Nudge** system uses machine-learning models to predict which pull requests are likely to stall, identifies the actor blocking progress, and sends tailored reminders. In large-scale trials, Nudge reduced pull request resolution time by **60%** compared to generic overdue notifications, and **73%** of recipients perceived the reminders as useful.

### Practical recommendations

When following up on overdue tasks, consider these research-backed approaches:

- **Ask "Why?"** - Use open-ended questions (e.g., "Can you share what obstacles you've encountered?") to diagnose root causes and demonstrate empathy
- **Provide informational rationales** - Explain the importance and context of tasks (e.g., "Completing this report helps the team meet client expectations on time")
- **Use non-controlling language** - Avoid "must" or "should"; instead, frame suggestions as options or invitations (e.g., "You might consider…")
- **Tailor notifications with context** - When possible, personalize follow-ups rather than sending blanket overdue alerts
- **Train managers in autonomy-support** - Implement theory-based approaches to teach autonomy-supportive behaviors

By shifting from threat-based, status-driven reminders to supportive, informational approaches that respect team members' autonomy and competence, you can more effectively manage overdue tasks and foster a healthier, more motivated work culture.

## Best practices for following up on overdue tasks

While waiting for automated escalation features, you can implement these best practices for effective follow-up:

1. **Be consistent** - Check for overdue tasks at regular intervals
2. **Understand before acting** - Ask about barriers or blockers before assuming negligence
3. **Offer help** - When following up, ask if assistance is needed to move the task forward
4. **Document follow-ups** - Use [comments](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-can-i-manage-comments-in-tallyfy/) to maintain a record of all follow-up communications
5. **Set clear expectations** - When extending deadlines, establish new, realistic timeframes

:::tip[Reminder]
Remember that the most effective follow-ups focus on removing obstacles and providing support, not just pointing out that something is late.
