## How to handle overdue task escalation

You can escalate overdue tasks in Tallyfy right now by using expiring tasks as automation triggers. Overdue tasks left unchecked pile up into [task debt](/products/pro/tutorials/how-to/how-to-avoid-task-debt/) that bogs down your team.

:::note[Understanding overdue tasks]
A task becomes overdue when its **deadline** passes - the date and time when work should be **complete**. This is different from the start time, which is when work should **begin**. Only the deadline determines overdue status.
:::

### Current ways to handle overdue tasks

- **Add comments manually** - Comment on any overdue task to ask for a status update
- **Daily digest emails** - Active members receive digest emails (sent at 6 AM in each user's local time) that highlight overdue tasks. Users can opt out via their preferences
- **Filter for overdue tasks** - Use the [Tracker view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/) and [Tasks view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/) to show only overdue tasks
- **Watch specific items** - "Watch" a process or task to get notifications for all changes. This doesn't currently notify when a task first becomes overdue

### Using expiring tasks as overdue automation triggers

An [expiring task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-types-of-tasks-can-i-create-with-tallyfy/) auto-completes when its deadline hits, which fires the [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) engine. You can use this to trigger any action - like adding an assignee to the real task - when a deadline passes.

**How to set it up**

1. Open your template in the Template Editor
2. Add a new step near the task you want to monitor and set its type to **Expiring**
3. Name it something like "Overdue trigger for [Task Name]"
4. Set the expiring step's deadline to match the task you're monitoring
5. Go to **Automations** and create a rule:
   - **IF**: Select the expiring step, then pick the condition **"is expired"**
   - **THEN**: Select **"Add Assignees"**, choose the person or group, and set **"Apply To"** to the actual task

The expiring step auto-completes at deadline, the automation fires, and the assignee gets added automatically. No manual work needed.

**Things to keep in mind**

- The expiring step requires no action from anyone - it sits quietly until the deadline passes
- If someone acknowledges the expiring step before the deadline, the "is expired" condition won't fire - useful for cancelling the escalation
- Use **"Replace Assignees"** instead of **"Add Assignees"** to fully reassign rather than add someone
- Form field changes (like checking a checkbox) without completing the step won't trigger automations - the expiring task sidesteps this by completing automatically

## Following up on overdue tasks effectively

Research shows that threat-based reminders ("this task is overdue!") undermine motivation and hurt performance. Supportive approaches work better - ask about blockers, provide context, and frame suggestions as options rather than demands.

### Practical tips

- **Ask about blockers first** - "What obstacles have you hit?" beats "Why isn't this done?"
- **Provide context** - Explain why the task matters (e.g., "This report helps meet client expectations on time")
- **Use non-controlling language** - "You might consider..." instead of "You must..."
- **Be consistent** - Check for overdue tasks at regular intervals
- **Document follow-ups** - Use [comments](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-can-i-manage-comments-in-tallyfy/) to record all follow-up conversations
- **Set clear new deadlines** - When extending deadlines, pick realistic timeframes

:::tip[Reminder]
The best follow-ups focus on removing obstacles and providing support, not just pointing out that something is late.

## Preventing task debt before escalation

Prevention beats constant escalation:

- **Use expiring tasks** for FYI items - [expiring tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-types-of-tasks-can-i-create-with-tallyfy/) auto-complete at deadline, preventing buildup of non-critical overdue items
- **Bundle related work** into single tasks with multiple form fields instead of many small tasks
- **Set realistic deadlines** based on actual completion patterns, not optimistic estimates
- **Audit task necessity** - remove tasks that consistently go overdue without consequences
