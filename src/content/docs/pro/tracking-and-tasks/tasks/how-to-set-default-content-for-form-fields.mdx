## What is default content in form fields?

Default content automatically pre-fills [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) with values when a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) or kick-off form opens. It's a real time-saver - reducing data entry and keeping things consistent across your [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).

You can use static text, dynamic [variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/), or system-generated values like today's date. And yes, users can still change these pre-filled values whenever they need to.

### Why should I use default content in form fields?

- **Faster form completion**: Users spend way less time typing the same info over and over.
- **Reduced errors**: Pre-filled content keeps formatting consistent and cuts down on typos.
- **Better user experience**: Let's be honest - forms feel so much easier when they're already partially filled.
- **Dynamic information**: Variables automatically pull in relevant data from earlier steps. No more copy-paste.
- **Smart defaults**: Set the most commonly selected options to help people decide faster.

## Which field types support default content in Tallyfy?

Not all [form field types](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) support default content. Here's what works:


### Text fields (Short text and Long text)
Text fields give you the most flexibility - they're the workhorses of default content.

- **Static text**: Pre-fill with standard phrases, instructions, or helpful examples.
- **Variables**: Pull data from previous form fields or system variables.
- **Mixed content**: Combine static text with variables (like "Request from `{{customer_name}}`").

### Selection fields (Dropdown, Radio buttons, Checklist)
Want to speed things up? Pre-select the options people pick most often.

- **Default selections**: Choose the most common option and save everyone a click.
- **Multiple defaults**: For checklists, you can pre-check several items at once.

### Date fields
Date fields are smart - they calculate deadlines and timestamps automatically.

- **Current date/time**: Sets to today's date. Simple.
- **Relative dates**: Need something due next week? Use "today + 7 days".
- **Variable dates**: Pull date values from earlier form fields.

### Which field types cannot have default content?
Some field types can't have defaults - mostly for technical or security reasons. Here's why:

- **File upload**: Can't pre-populate files (security thing - and honestly, would you want random files appearing?).
- **Table**: Can't pre-fill table rows, though you do set up column headers during configuration.
- **Assignee picker**: Can't pre-select specific users here, but don't worry - you can set default assignments at the step level instead.

## How do I configure default content for form fields?

### How to set default content for text fields

<Steps>
1. Open your [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in **Edit** mode.
2. Click on the step containing the form field you want to configure.
3. Go to the **Form Fields** tab in the details panel.
4. Click on the specific form field to open its settings.
5. Look for the **Default Value** or **Default Content** field in the settings.
6. Enter your default text or click the **{ }** button to insert variables.
7. Save your changes.
</Steps>

### How to set default selections for dropdown and radio buttons

<Steps>
1. Open the form field settings (same process as above).
2. In the **Options** section, enter your list of choices - one per line.
3. Find the **Default** or **Default Selection** option.
4. Pick which option should be pre-selected when the form loads.
5. Save your changes. Done!
</Steps>

### How to set default selections for checklists

<Steps>
1. Open the checklist field settings.
2. In the **Options** section, type your list of items (one per line).
3. Find the **Default** or **Pre-checked items** options.
4. Select which items should already be checked when someone opens the form.
5. Don't worry - users can still uncheck these if they need to.
6. Hit save and you're all set.
</Steps>

### How to set default dates

<Steps>
1. Open the date field settings.
2. Look for **Default Date** or **Default Content** options.
3. Pick what works best:
   - **Today**: Automatically uses the current date.
   - **Today + X days**: Perfect for deadlines (like "Today + 7 days" for next week).
   - **Custom date**: Set a specific date that never changes.
   - **Variable**: Pull a date from another form field.
4. Need time too? Date/time fields let you set default times as well.
5. Save your changes.
</Steps>

## How can I use variables in default content?

[Variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/) are where things get really interesting. They pull information from other parts of your process and drop it right where you need it.

### What types of variables can I use in default content?

**Form field variables**: These grab data that someone entered in earlier steps.
- Example: `{{customer_name}}` pulls in the customer name from a previous field. No retyping needed.

**Kick-off form variables**: Info that was entered when the process first started.
- Example: `{{request_type}}` shows whatever type was selected in the kick-off form.

**System variables**: Tallyfy generates these automatically - they're always current.
- `{{DATE}}`: Today's date
- `{{TIME}}`: Current time
- `{{TEMPLATE_NAME}}`: The template you're using
- `{{PROCESS_NAME}}`: This specific process instance's name

### What are examples of effective variable usage?

**Customer communication**: Here's a template that practically writes itself:
```
Dear {{customer_name}},

Thank you for your {{request_type}} request submitted on {{DATE}}. 
We will process this within 5 business days.
```

**Reference numbers**: Need unique IDs? Create them automatically:
```
{{TEMPLATE_NAME}}-{{DATE}}-{{customer_id}}
```

**Follow-up dates**: Keep track of deadlines without thinking:
```
Follow up with {{customer_name}} by {{deadline_date}}
```

## What are best practices for default content?

### How to choose meaningful defaults
- Pick the options people actually select 80% of the time for dropdowns and radio buttons.
- Set default dates that match your real process timeline - not wishful thinking.
- Pre-fill text fields with genuine examples or formats people can actually use.

### Why should I keep defaults flexible?
- Users will change defaults if they need to - that's the whole point. Don't box them in.
- Think of defaults as helpful suggestions, not rules.
- Test with real users. If they're constantly changing your defaults, you've got the wrong defaults.

### How to use variables strategically
- Mix static text with variables - you get consistency AND personalization.
- System variables are perfect for timestamps and tracking info.
- Reference earlier form fields to keep everything connected. Context matters.

### Considering your audience
- **Internal forms**: Use shortcuts and abbreviations your team understands.
- **External forms**: Provide clear, spelled-out options for customers.
- **Repetitive processes**: Add comprehensive defaults for frequently-used processes.

### How do I maintain and update default content?
- Check your defaults every few months. Things change.
- Listen when users complain - they're telling you what needs fixing.
- If everyone's changing a default, just delete it. It's not helping.

## What are common use cases for default content?

### Customer service requests
Want faster response times? Default content is your secret weapon.

- **Default priority**: Set to "Medium" - let's be honest, most requests aren't actually urgent.
- **Default category**: Pre-select whatever 60% of your tickets are about. Saves time.
- **Response template**: Drop in a friendly greeting with the customer's name already filled in. Personal touch, zero effort.

### Approval workflows
Nobody likes waiting for approvals. Smart defaults keep things moving.

- **Default reviewer**: Match the reviewer to the request type. Finance requests go to finance team - simple.
- **Due date**: "Today + 3 days" gives reviewers breathing room without dragging forever.
- **Approval notes**: Give reviewers a template so feedback stays consistent and useful.

### Project initiation
Starting new projects? Stop reinventing the wheel every time.

- **Project prefix**: Combine template name + today's date. Instant project codes that actually make sense.
- **Default team members**: Pre-select your usual suspects for each project type. They know they're on it.
- **Timeline defaults**: Standard milestones based on the start date. Realistic timelines from day one.

### Document generation
Here's where default content really shines - automated documents that don't feel robotic.

- **Document title**: Mix project name + document type + date. Clean, searchable, organized.
- **Author information**: Pull requestor details straight from the kick-off form. No more "who wrote this?"
- **Version numbering**: Start everyone at "v1.0". Consistency across the board.

The bottom line? Default content turns empty forms into smart, helpful starting points. Your team saves time, makes fewer mistakes, and still has total flexibility to customize when they need to. That's a win.
