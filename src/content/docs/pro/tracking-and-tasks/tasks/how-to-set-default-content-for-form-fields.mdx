## What is default content in form fields?

Default content automatically pre-fills [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) with values when a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) or kick-off form is opened. This saves time for users by reducing data entry and ensures consistency across [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).

Default content can be static text, dynamic [variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/), or system-generated values like the current date. Users can still modify these pre-filled values if needed.

### Benefits of using default content

- **Faster form completion**: Users spend less time typing common information.
- **Reduced errors**: Pre-filled content ensures consistent formatting and reduces typos.
- **Better user experience**: Forms feel easier to complete when partially filled.
- **Dynamic information**: Use variables to automatically insert relevant data from earlier steps.
- **Smart defaults**: Set commonly selected options to speed up decision-making.

## Which field types support default content

Not all [form field types](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) support default content. Here's what's available:


### Text fields (Short text and Long text)
- **Static text**: Pre-fill with standard phrases, instructions, or examples.
- **Variables**: Insert data from previous form fields or system variables.
- **Mixed content**: Combine static text with variables (e.g., "Request from `{{customer_name}}`").

### Selection fields (Dropdown, Radio buttons, Checklist)
- **Default selections**: Pre-select the most common choices.
- **Multiple defaults**: For checklists, you can pre-check multiple items.

### Date fields
- **Current date/time**: Automatically set to today's date.
- **Relative dates**: Set to a specific number of days from today (e.g., "today + 7 days").
- **Variable dates**: Use date values from earlier form fields.

### Fields that don't support default content
- **File upload**: Cannot pre-populate files for security reasons.
- **Table**: Cannot pre-fill table rows (though column headers are defined during setup).
- **Assignee picker**: Cannot pre-select specific users (though you can set default assignments at the step level).

## How to set default content

5. Save your changes.
</Steps>

## Using variables in default content

[Variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/) make default content dynamic by pulling information from other parts of your process.

### Available variable types

**Form field variables**: Data entered in earlier steps of the same process.
- Example: `{{customer_name}}` inserts the customer name from a previous field.

**Kick-off form variables**: Information entered when the process started.
- Example: `{{request_type}}` shows the type selected in the kick-off form.

**System variables**: Automatically generated information.
- `{{DATE}}`: Current date
- `{{TIME}}`: Current time
- `{{TEMPLATE_NAME}}`: Name of the template being used
- `{{PROCESS_NAME}}`: Name of the current process instance

### Examples of variable usage

**Customer communication**: Set a default message like:
```
Dear {{customer_name}},

Thank you for your {{request_type}} request submitted on {{DATE}}. 
We will process this within 5 business days.
```

**Reference numbers**: Create automatic reference formats:
```
{{TEMPLATE_NAME}}-{{DATE}}-{{customer_id}}
```

**Follow-up dates**: Use relative dates:
```
Follow up with {{customer_name}} by {{deadline_date}}
```

## Best practices for default content

### Choose meaningful defaults
- Use the most common selections for dropdown and radio button fields.
- Set default dates that make sense for your process timeline.
- Pre-fill text fields with helpful examples or standard formats.

### Keep it flexible
- Remember users can modify default content, so don't make it too specific.
- Use defaults to guide users, not restrict them.
- Test your defaults with actual users to ensure they're helpful.

### Use variables strategically
- Combine static text with variables for personalized but consistent content.
- Use system variables for timestamps and process information.
- Reference earlier form fields to maintain context throughout the process.

### Consider your audience
- **Internal forms**: Use more technical defaults and abbreviations.
- **External forms**: Use clearer, more explanatory default text.
- **Repetitive processes**: Maximize defaults to speed up familiar workflows.

### Maintain and update
- Review default content regularly to ensure it stays relevant.
- Update defaults based on user feedback and process changes.
- Remove defaults that users consistently change or ignore.

## Common use cases

### Customer service requests
- **Default priority**: Set to "Medium" since most requests aren't urgent.
- **Default category**: Pre-select the most common request type.
- **Response template**: Include standard greeting with customer name variable.

### Approval workflows
- **Default reviewer**: Pre-select based on request type or department.
- **Due date**: Set to standard review timeframe (e.g., "Today + 3 days").
- **Approval notes**: Include template for consistent feedback format.

### Project initiation
- **Project prefix**: Use template name and current date for project codes.
- **Default team members**: Pre-select core team members for the project type.
- **Timeline defaults**: Set standard milestone dates based on project start date.

### Document generation
- **Document title**: Combine project name with document type and date.
- **Author information**: Use requestor details from kick-off form.
- **Version numbering**: Start with "v1.0" for new documents.

Default content transforms empty forms into helpful, guided experiences that save time and reduce errors while maintaining the flexibility users need to customize information for their specific situation.
