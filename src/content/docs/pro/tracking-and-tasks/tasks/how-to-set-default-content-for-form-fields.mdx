## What is default content in form fields?

Default content pre-fills [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) with values when a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) or kick-off form opens. You can use static text, dynamic [variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/), or system-generated values like today's date. Users can still change these pre-filled values whenever they need to.

### Why use default content?

- **Faster completion** - less time retyping common information.
- **Fewer errors** - consistent formatting and fewer typos.
- **Dynamic data** - [variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/) pull in relevant data from earlier steps automatically.
- **Smart selections** - pre-select the most common options for dropdowns and radio buttons.

## Which field types support default content?

Not all [form field types](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) support default content. Here's what works:

### Text fields (short text and long text)

- **Static text** - pre-fill with standard phrases, instructions, or examples.
- **Variables** - pull data from previous form fields or system variables.
- **Mixed content** - combine static text with variables (like "Request from `{{customer_name}}`").

### Selection fields (dropdown, radio buttons, multiselect)

- **Default selections** - pre-select the most common option.
- **Multiple defaults** - for multiselect fields, you can pre-check several items at once.

### Date fields

- **Current date** - sets to today's date when the form opens.
- **Specific date** - set a fixed date value.
- **Variable dates** - pull date values from earlier form fields.

### Field types that don't support defaults

These field types can't have default values - Tallyfy automatically disables the option for them:

- **File upload** - can't pre-populate files.
- **Table** - can't pre-fill table rows, though you configure column headers during setup.
- **Assignee picker** - can't pre-select users here, but you can set default assignments at the step level instead.

## How to configure default content

### Setting defaults for text fields

<Steps>
1. Open your [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in **Edit** mode.
2. Click on the step containing the form field.
3. Click on the form field to expand its settings.
4. Expand the **Default content** section.
5. Toggle the default value switch to **Yes**.
6. Enter your default text or click the **{ }** button to insert variables.
7. Save your changes.
</Steps>

### Setting defaults for dropdown and radio buttons

<Steps>
1. Expand the form field settings and open the **Default content** section.
2. Toggle the default value switch to **Yes**.
3. Pick which option should be pre-selected when the form loads.
4. Save your changes.
</Steps>

### Setting defaults for multiselect fields

<Steps>
1. Expand the form field settings and open the **Default content** section.
2. Toggle the default value switch to **Yes**.
3. Select which items should already be checked when someone opens the form.
4. Users can still uncheck or change these selections.
5. Save your changes.
</Steps>

### Setting default dates

<Steps>
1. Expand the date field settings and open the **Default content** section.
2. Toggle the default value switch to **Yes**.
3. Enter a date value. If the field has **Collect time** enabled, you can set a default time too.
4. Save your changes.
</Steps>

## Using variables in default content

[Variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/) pull information from other parts of your process into default values.

### Variable types available

**Form field variables** - grab data entered in earlier steps:
- Example: `{{customer_name}}` pulls in the customer name from a previous field.

**Kick-off form variables** - data entered when the process started:
- Example: `{{request_type}}` shows the type selected in the kick-off form.

**System variables** - Tallyfy generates these automatically:
- `{{DATE}}` - the date when the process was launched
- `{{TEMPLATE_NAME}}` - the name of the template being used

### Variable usage examples

**Customer communication:**
```
Dear {{customer_name}},

Thank you for your {{request_type}} request submitted on {{DATE}}.
We will process this within 5 business days.
```

**Reference numbers:**
```
{{TEMPLATE_NAME}}-{{DATE}}-{{customer_id}}
```

**Follow-up tracking:**
```
Follow up with {{customer_name}} by {{deadline_date}}
```

## Best practices

- Pick the options people actually select most often for dropdown and radio button defaults.
- Pre-fill text fields with real examples or formats your team can use directly.
- Think of defaults as suggestions, not rules. If everyone's changing a default, it's the wrong default.
- Mix static text with variables for consistency and personalization.
- **Internal forms** - use shortcuts and abbreviations your team understands.
- **External forms** - provide clear, spelled-out options for customers.
- Review your defaults periodically - processes change over time.

## Common use cases

### Customer service requests

- **Default priority** - set to "Medium" since most requests aren't urgent.
- **Default category** - pre-select the most common ticket type.
- **Response template** - pre-fill a greeting with the customer's name using variables.

### Approval workflows

- **Default reviewer** - match the reviewer to the request type.
- **Approval notes** - give reviewers a template so feedback stays consistent.

### Project initiation

- **Project prefix** - combine `{{TEMPLATE_NAME}}` + `{{DATE}}` for automatic project codes.
- **Author information** - pull requestor details from the kick-off form using variables.
- **Version numbering** - start at "v1.0" for consistency.
