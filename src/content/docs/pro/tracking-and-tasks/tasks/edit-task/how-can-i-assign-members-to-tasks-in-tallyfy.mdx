## Assigning members and guests to tasks

Assign [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in Tallyfy at three points - when building a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), during [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) launch, or while it's already running.

### Assign tasks in a template

Set default assignees in your template:
<Steps>
1. Click the step you want to assign.
2. Go to the **Assign** tab.
3. Pick the default assignee - a specific [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/), a group, a [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) email, or a [job title](/products/pro/documenting/templates/edit-templates/understanding-assignment-types/).
4. Leave it unassigned by choosing no assignee (see "Assign launcher automatically" below).
</Steps>
These defaults apply every time someone launches the process. You can change them at launch.

### Assign tasks when launching a process

Modify assignments during launch:
<Steps>
1. After clicking **Launch Process**, look for **Review & Edit** before final confirmation.
2. Click tasks on the review screen and change who's assigned for this instance.
3. Remove all assignees to leave a task unassigned for this run.
</Steps>

### Assign or reassign tasks in a running process

Change assignments in a running process:
<Steps>
1. Open the running process and find the task.
2. Click the menu icon (...) on the task card and choose **Edit task**.
3. Add or remove assignees.
4. Click **Save Changes**.
</Steps>

### Unassigned tasks ("nobody assigned")

Tasks with no assignees show a generic icon and **"Nobody Assigned"** label. Find them using the **"Assigned to nobody"** filter in the [Tasks view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/). Anyone with permission can claim them or assign them to others.

### "Assign launcher automatically" setting

This per-step setting controls what happens when no assignees are configured:

*   **If ON (default)**: The person who launches the process gets auto-assigned to any step that has no members, groups, or guests assigned.
*   **If OFF**: Steps with no assignees stay as "Nobody Assigned" after launch.

If any assignee is already set - whether a member, group, or guest - this setting has no effect on that step.

### Restrict task completion and editing

Control who can complete or edit tasks:

<Steps>
1. When editing the template, click the task step.
2. Go to the **Settings** tab.
3. Turn on **"Only assigned members can complete or edit this task"**.
</Steps>

:::note[Admin override]
**Administrators** can always complete or edit any task, regardless of this setting.
