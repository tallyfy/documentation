## How to assign members and guests to tasks

Assigning [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) to [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in Tallyfy clarifies responsibility, ensures accountability, and helps automate processes. This article explains how to assign tasks in different scenarios.

In a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/):

<Steps>
1. Open the _Assign_ tab within the template.
2. Specify the [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) you want to assign to the [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), or select **Nobody right now** to leave it unassigned.
3. Every time the [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) is launched, that member will be assigned to the chosen task, or it will remain unassigned if that option was selected.
</Steps>

When launching a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/):

<Steps>
1. Launch the process.
2. Before clicking "Go," select _Review & Edit_ to assign [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/).
3. Choose the member(s) you want to assign to the [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), or leave tasks unassigned by removing all assignees.
</Steps>

Within an active [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) or a one-off [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/):

<Steps>
1. Open the task card and click on the ⋮ icon.
2. Select _Edit task_.
3. Choose the [person](/products/pro/documenting/members/) you want to assign to the task, or remove all assignees to leave it unassigned.
4. Click _Save Changes_.
</Steps>

### Creating or updating tasks with no assignees

Tallyfy now supports creating and updating [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) without assignees. When a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) has no assignees:

1. It will appear with a default avatar and the label **"Nobody Assigned"** in task lists and email notifications.
2. You can filter for these tasks using the **"Assigned to nobody"** filter in the [Tasks view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/).
3. These unassigned tasks can be assigned to specific [team members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) or [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) at any time by editing the [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/).

This feature is useful when you want to create tasks in advance but decide on assignees later, or when a task is awaiting reassignment.

### Understanding the "Assign launcher automatically" setting

The behavior of unassigned tasks is controlled by the **"Assign launcher automatically"** setting in the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) editor's Advanced tab:

#### When "Assign launcher automatically" is ON (default)

- If you specify [members/groups](/products/pro/documenting/members/) as assignees, they'll be the only assignees after launch
- If you specify no assignees (select "Nobody right now"), the [process launcher](/products/pro/documenting/members/) will be assigned automatically
- If you assign only [guest users](/products/pro/documenting/guests/), both the process launcher AND the guests will be assigned

#### When "Assign launcher automatically" is OFF

- If you specify [members/groups](/products/pro/documenting/members/) as assignees, they'll be the only assignees after launch
- If you specify no assignees (select "Nobody right now"), the [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) will remain completely unassigned
- If you assign only [guest users](/products/pro/documenting/guests/), only the guests will be assigned (not the process launcher)

You can change this setting in the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) editor by:
<Steps>
1. Selecting the step
2. Opening the Advanced tab
3. Toggling the "Assign launcher automatically" setting
</Steps>

### How to reassign a task to another member

If you need to reassign a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) that's already been assigned to someone else, follow these steps:

<Steps>
1. Navigate to the task you want to reassign
2. Click the pencil icon (or the ⋮ icon and select _Edit task_)
3. To add assignees without removing current ones, simply select additional names.
4. To remove current assignees, click the **X** next to their names.
5. To replace assignees completely, first remove the current ones by clicking the **X** next to their names, then select the new assignees.
6. Click _Save Changes_ to confirm the reassignment
</Steps>

:::note[Taking over a task]
Individual users can "take over" a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) by removing all current assignees (including groups) and assigning the task only to themselves. This can be a useful workaround when you need more control over task ownership, especially when working with group assignments.
:::

:::note[Permissions required]
To reassign tasks, you need to have appropriate permissions in Tallyfy. Administrators can always reassign tasks, while other roles may have limited reassignment capabilities depending on your organization's settings.
:::

### Restricting task completion to assigned members only

If you want to prevent other [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) (except administrators) from completing or editing a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/):

<Steps>
1. In the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) editor, click on the step you want to restrict
2. Select the **Advanced** tab
3. Enable the option **"Only assigned members can complete or edit this task"**
</Steps>

![Restrict task completion setting](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-only-assigned-can-complete.png)

This setting applies to any [task type](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-types-of-tasks-can-i-create-with-tallyfy/), including approve/reject tasks. When enabled, only the [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) explicitly assigned to the task will be able to complete, approve, reject, or edit it. Note that this restriction does not apply to users with Administrator [roles](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-do-i-manage-member-permissions-in-tallyfy/), as they maintain full access to all tasks.

Assigning members ensures everyone knows their responsibilities.
