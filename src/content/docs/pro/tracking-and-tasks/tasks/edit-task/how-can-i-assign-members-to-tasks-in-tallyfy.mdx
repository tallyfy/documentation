## How to assign members or guests after launching the process

Assigning members to tasks in Tallyfy is crucial for a seamless workflow. Assignments make it clear who is responsible for each task and ensure accountability. Plus, it helps automate processes, so everything runs smoothly. Let's see how you can assign someone to a task in different scenarios.

In a template:

1. Open the _Assign_ tab within the template.
2. Specify the member you want to assign to the task.
3. Every time the process is launched, that member will be assigned to the chosen task.

When launching a process:

1. Launch the process.
2. Before clicking "Go," select _Review & Edit_ to assign members.
3. Choose the member(s) you want to assign to the tasks.

Within an active process or a one-off task:

1. Open the task card and click on the â‹® icon.
2. Select _Edit task_.
3. Choose the person you want to assign to the task.
4. Click _Save Changes_.

Remember, assigning members ensures everyone knows their responsibilities and keeps things moving smoothly. Give it a try and enjoy a more organized and efficient workflow!
