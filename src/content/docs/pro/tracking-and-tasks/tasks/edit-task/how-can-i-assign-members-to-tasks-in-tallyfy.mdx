## How can I assign members and guests to tasks?

Assigning [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) shows who is responsible for the work. Assign tasks when building a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), when launching a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), or after a process starts. This flexibility ensures proper accountability throughout the workflow lifecycle.

### How do I assign tasks in a template?

When editing a template, set the default assignee for each step.
<Steps>
1. Click the step you want to assign.
2. Go to the **Assign** tab in the settings panel.
3. Choose the default assignee: a specific [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/), a group, a [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) email, or a [job title](/products/pro/documenting/templates/edit-templates/understanding-assignment-types/).
4. You can also choose **Nobody right now** to leave it unassigned by default (see note below on "Assign launcher automatically").
</Steps>
This default assignment is used each time the process launches, unless changed during launch.

### How do I assign tasks when launching a process?

Before you finalize launching, you often get a chance to review and change assignments.
<Steps>
1. After clicking **Launch Process** on a template, look for 'Review & Edit' before the final confirmation.
2. On the review screen, click tasks and change who is assigned for this instance.
3. You can remove all assignees to leave a task unassigned for this run.
</Steps>

### How can I assign or reassign tasks in a running process?

You can change task assignments after the process is running.
<Steps>
1. Open the running process and find the task.
2. Click the menu icon (...) on the task card and choose 'Edit task' (or sometimes click the assignee area).
3. Add or remove assignees from the list.
4. Click **Save Changes**.
</Steps>

### How do unassigned tasks work ("nobody assigned")?

Tallyfy allows tasks with no assignment.
*   These tasks appear with a generic icon and say **"Nobody Assigned"**.
*   Find them using the **"Assigned to nobody"** filter in the [Tasks view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/).
*   Anyone with permission can assign them later, or someone can 'take' it by assigning it to themselves.

### How does the "Assign launcher automatically" setting work?

This setting (in the template step's **Advanced** tab) controls what happens if a step has no default assignee set in the template:

*   **If ON (Default)**:
    *   If no one is assigned in the template, the process *launcher* is automatically assigned.
    *   If only guests are assigned in the template, *both* the launcher and guests are assigned.
*   **If OFF**:
    *   If no one is assigned in the template, the task starts as 'Nobody Assigned'.
    *   If only guests are assigned, *only* the guests are assigned (the launcher is not).

### How can I restrict task completion and editing?

If you want only assigned people to complete or edit the task:

<Steps>
1. When editing the template, click the task step.
2. Go to the **Advanced** tab.
3. Switch **ON** the toggle **"Only assigned members can complete or edit this task"**.
</Steps>

:::note[Admin override]
**Administrators** can always complete or edit any task, regardless of this setting.
