## How to assign members or guests after launching the process

Assigning members to tasks in Tallyfy is crucial for a seamless workflow. Assignments make it clear who is responsible for each task and ensure accountability. Plus, it helps automate processes, so everything runs smoothly. Let's see how you can assign someone to a task in different scenarios.

In a template:

1. Open the _Assign_ tab within the template.
2. Specify the member you want to assign to the task.
3. Every time the process is launched, that member will be assigned to the chosen task.

When launching a process:

1. Launch the process.
2. Before clicking "Go," select _Review & Edit_ to assign members.
3. Choose the member(s) you want to assign to the tasks.

Within an active process or a one-off task:

1. Open the task card and click on the ⋮ icon.
2. Select _Edit task_.
3. Choose the person you want to assign to the task.
4. Click _Save Changes_.

## How to reassign a task to another member

If you need to reassign a task that's already been assigned to someone else, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the task you want to reassign
2. Click the pencil icon (or the ⋮ icon and select _Edit task_)
3. In the edit interface, you can:
   - Add new assignees without removing current ones
   - Remove current assignees by clicking the X next to their names
   - Replace assignees completely by removing current ones and adding new ones
4. Click _Save Changes_ to confirm the reassignment

:::note[Permissions required]
To reassign tasks, you need to have appropriate permissions in Tallyfy. Administrators can always reassign tasks, while other roles may have limited reassignment capabilities depending on your organization's settings.

## Restricting task completion to assigned members only

If you want to prevent other members (except administrators) from completing or editing a task:

1. In the template editor, click on the step you want to restrict
2. Select the **Advanced** tab
3. Enable the option **"Only assigned members can complete or edit this task"**

This setting applies to any task type, including approve/reject tasks. When enabled, only the members explicitly assigned to the task will be able to complete, approve, reject, or edit it. Note that this restriction does not apply to users with Administrator roles, as they maintain full access to all tasks.

Remember, assigning members ensures everyone knows their responsibilities and keeps things moving smoothly.
