## How can I assign members and guests to tasks?

Want to assign [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in Tallyfy? You've got three options: assign when building a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), during [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) launch, or while the process is already running. Simple.

Let's dive into each approach - they all work great depending on when you need to make assignments.

### How do I assign tasks in a template?

Setting default assignees in your template is the foundation. Here's how:
<Steps>
1. Click the step you want to assign.
2. Go to the **Assign** tab in the settings panel.
3. Choose the default assignee: a specific [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/), a group, a [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) email, or a [job title](/products/pro/documenting/templates/edit-templates/understanding-assignment-types/).
4. You can also choose **Nobody right now** to leave it unassigned by default (see note below on "Assign launcher automatically").
</Steps>
These defaults kick in every time someone launches the process. But don't worry - you can change them during launch if needed.

### How do I assign tasks when launching a process?

Launching a process? You'll usually get a chance to tweak assignments before things kick off.
<Steps>
1. After clicking **Launch Process** on a template, look for 'Review & Edit' before the final confirmation.
2. On the review screen, click tasks and change who is assigned for this instance.
3. You can remove all assignees to leave a task unassigned for this run.
</Steps>

### How can I assign or reassign tasks in a running process?

Need to change assignments mid-flight? No problem.
<Steps>
1. Open the running process and find the task.
2. Click the menu icon (...) on the task card and choose 'Edit task' (or sometimes click the assignee area).
3. Add or remove assignees from the list.
4. Click **Save Changes**.
</Steps>

### How do unassigned tasks work ("nobody assigned")?

Sometimes you want tasks without initial assignments. Tallyfy handles this elegantly:
*   These tasks show up with a generic icon and **"Nobody Assigned"** label.
*   You'll find them using the **"Assigned to nobody"** filter in the [Tasks view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/).
*   Anyone with permission can grab them later - either assigning to others or claiming them personally.

### How does the "Assign launcher automatically" setting work?

This clever setting (tucked in the template step's **Advanced** tab) determines what happens when there's no default assignee:

*   **If ON (Default)**:
    *   No one assigned in the template? The process launcher gets it automatically.
    *   Only guests assigned? Both the launcher and guests get assigned.
*   **If OFF**:
    *   No one assigned in the template? Task starts as 'Nobody Assigned'.
    *   Only guests assigned? Just the guests get it (launcher doesn't).

Think of it as your safety net - ensuring tasks don't fall through the cracks.

### How can I restrict task completion and editing?

Want tighter control over who can complete or edit tasks? Here's your solution:

<Steps>
1. When editing the template, click the task step.
2. Go to the **Advanced** tab.
3. Switch **ON** the toggle **"Only assigned members can complete or edit this task"**.
</Steps>

:::note[Admin override]
**Administrators** can always complete or edit any task, regardless of this setting.
