## Assigning members and guests to tasks

You can assign [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in Tallyfy at three points: when building a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), during [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) launch, or while the process is already running.

### Assign tasks in a template

To set default assignees in your template:
<Steps>
1. Click the step you want to assign.
2. Go to the **Assign** tab in the settings panel.
3. Choose the default assignee: a specific [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/), a group, a [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) email, or a [job title](/products/pro/documenting/templates/edit-templates/understanding-assignment-types/).
4. You can also choose **Nobody right now** to leave it unassigned by default (see note below on "Assign launcher automatically").
</Steps>
These defaults apply every time someone launches the process. You can change them during launch if needed.

### Assign tasks when launching a process

During process launch, you can modify assignments:
<Steps>
1. After clicking **Launch Process** on a template, look for 'Review & Edit' before the final confirmation.
2. On the review screen, click tasks and change who is assigned for this instance.
3. You can remove all assignees to leave a task unassigned for this run.
</Steps>

### Assign or reassign tasks in a running process

To change assignments in a running process:
<Steps>
1. Open the running process and find the task.
2. Click the menu icon (...) on the task card and choose 'Edit task' (or sometimes click the assignee area).
3. Add or remove assignees from the list.
4. Click **Save Changes**.
</Steps>

### Unassigned tasks ("nobody assigned")

Tasks without initial assignments:
*   These tasks show up with a generic icon and **"Nobody Assigned"** label.
*   You'll find them using the **"Assigned to nobody"** filter in the [Tasks view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/).
*   Anyone with permission can grab them later - either assigning to others or claiming them personally.

### "Assign launcher automatically" setting

This setting in the template step's **Advanced** tab determines what happens when there's no default assignee:

*   **If ON (Default)**:
    *   No one assigned in the template? The process launcher gets it automatically.
    *   Only guests assigned? Both the launcher and guests get assigned.
*   **If OFF**:
    *   No one assigned in the template? Task starts as 'Nobody Assigned'.
    *   Only guests assigned? Just the guests get it (launcher doesn't).


### Restrict task completion and editing

To control who can complete or edit tasks:

<Steps>
1. When editing the template, click the task step.
2. Go to the **Advanced** tab.
3. Switch **ON** the toggle **"Only assigned members can complete or edit this task"**.
</Steps>

:::note[Admin override]
**Administrators** can always complete or edit any task, regardless of this setting.
