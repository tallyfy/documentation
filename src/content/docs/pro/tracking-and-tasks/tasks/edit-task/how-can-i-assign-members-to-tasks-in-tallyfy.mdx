## How to assign members and guests to tasks

Assigning members to tasks in Tallyfy clarifies responsibility, ensures accountability, and helps automate processes. This article explains how to assign tasks in different scenarios.

In a template:

1. Open the _Assign_ tab within the template.
2. Specify the member you want to assign to the task, or select **Nobody right now** to leave it unassigned.
3. Every time the process is launched, that member will be assigned to the chosen task, or it will remain unassigned if that option was selected.

When launching a process:

1. Launch the process.
2. Before clicking "Go," select _Review & Edit_ to assign members.
3. Choose the member(s) you want to assign to the tasks, or leave tasks unassigned by removing all assignees.

Within an active process or a one-off task:

1. Open the task card and click on the ⋮ icon.
2. Select _Edit task_.
3. Choose the person you want to assign to the task, or remove all assignees to leave it unassigned.
4. Click _Save Changes_.

## Creating or updating tasks with no assignees

Tallyfy now supports creating and updating tasks without assignees. When a task has no assignees:

1. It will appear with a default avatar and the label **"Nobody Assigned"** in task lists and email notifications.
2. You can filter for these tasks using the **"Assigned to nobody"** filter in the Tasks view.
3. These unassigned tasks can be assigned to specific team members or guests at any time by editing the task.

This feature is useful when you want to create tasks in advance but decide on assignees later, or when a task is awaiting reassignment.

## Understanding the "Assign launcher automatically" setting

The behavior of unassigned tasks is controlled by the **"Assign launcher automatically"** setting in the template editor's Advanced tab:

### When "Assign launcher automatically" is ON (default):

- If you specify members/groups as assignees, they'll be the only assignees after launch
- If you specify no assignees (select "Nobody right now"), the process launcher will be assigned automatically
- If you assign only guest users, both the process launcher AND the guests will be assigned

### When "Assign launcher automatically" is OFF:

- If you specify members/groups as assignees, they'll be the only assignees after launch
- If you specify no assignees (select "Nobody right now"), the task will remain completely unassigned
- If you assign only guest users, only the guests will be assigned (not the process launcher)

You can change this setting in the template editor by:
1. Selecting the step
2. Opening the Advanced tab
3. Toggling the "Assign launcher automatically" setting

## How to reassign a task to another member

If you need to reassign a task that's already been assigned to someone else, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the task you want to reassign
2. Click the pencil icon (or the ⋮ icon and select _Edit task_)
3. In the edit interface, you can:
   - Add new assignees without removing current ones
   - Remove current assignees by clicking the X next to their names
   - Replace assignees completely by removing current ones and adding new ones
4. Click _Save Changes_ to confirm the reassignment

:::note[Taking over a task]
Individual users can "take over" a task by removing all current assignees (including groups) and assigning the task only to themselves. This can be a useful workaround when you need more control over task ownership, especially when working with group assignments.
:::

:::note[Permissions required]
To reassign tasks, you need to have appropriate permissions in Tallyfy. Administrators can always reassign tasks, while other roles may have limited reassignment capabilities depending on your organization's settings.

## Restricting task completion to assigned members only

If you want to prevent other members (except administrators) from completing or editing a task:

1. In the template editor, click on the step you want to restrict
2. Select the **Advanced** tab
3. Enable the option **"Only assigned members can complete or edit this task"**

This setting applies to any task type, including approve/reject tasks. When enabled, only the members explicitly assigned to the task will be able to complete, approve, reject, or edit it. Note that this restriction does not apply to users with Administrator roles, as they maintain full access to all tasks.

Assigning members ensures everyone knows their responsibilities.
