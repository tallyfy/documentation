## Assigning Members and Guests to Tasks

Assigning [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) clearly shows who is responsible for doing the work. You can assign tasks when building a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), when launching a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), or even after a process has started.

### Assigning in a Template

When editing a template, you set the *default* assignee for each step.
<Steps>
1. Click on the step you want to assign.
2. Go to the **Assign** tab in the details panel.
3. Choose who should normally do this task: a specific [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/), a group, a [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) email, or a [job title](/products/pro/documenting/templates/edit-templates/understanding-assignment-types/).
4. You can also choose **Nobody right now** to leave it unassigned by default (see note below on "Assign launcher automatically").
</Steps>
This default assignment will be used each time the process is launched, unless changed at launch time.

### Assigning When Launching a Process

Before you finalize launching a process, you often get a chance to review and change the default assignments.
<Steps>
1. After clicking **Launch Process** on a template, look for an option like **Review & Edit** before the final launch confirmation.
2. On the review screen, you can click on tasks and change who is assigned just for this specific run.
3. You can remove all assignees to leave a task unassigned for this run.
</Steps>

### Assigning/Reassigning Tasks in a Running Process

You can change who is assigned to a task even after the process is active.
<Steps>
1. Open the running process and find the task you want to change.
2. Click the menu icon (â‹®) on the task card and choose **Edit task** (or sometimes you can click directly on the assignee area).
3. Add or remove people from the assignee list.
4. Click **Save Changes**.
</Steps>

### Unassigned Tasks ("Nobody Assigned")

Tallyfy lets you have tasks with no one assigned.
*   These tasks show up with a generic icon and say **"Nobody Assigned"**.
*   You can find them easily using the **"Assigned to nobody"** filter in the [Tasks view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/).
*   Anyone with permission can assign these tasks later, or someone can "take" the task by assigning it to themselves.

### The "Assign launcher automatically" Setting

This setting (in the template step's Advanced tab) controls what happens if a step has *no default assignee* set in the template:

*   **If ON (Default)**:
    *   If no one is assigned in the template, the person *launching* the process gets automatically assigned.
    *   If only guests are assigned in the template, *both* the launcher *and* the guests get assigned.
*   **If OFF**:
    *   If no one is assigned in the template, the task starts as "Nobody Assigned".
    *   If only guests are assigned in the template, *only* the guests get assigned (the launcher does not).

### Restricting Task Completion/Editing

If you want *only* the people specifically assigned to a task to be able to complete or edit it:

<Steps>
1. When editing the template, click the task step.
2. Go to the **Advanced** tab.
3. Turn ON the toggle **"Only assigned members can complete or edit this task"**.
</Steps>

*Note: Administrators can always complete/edit any task, regardless of this setting.*
