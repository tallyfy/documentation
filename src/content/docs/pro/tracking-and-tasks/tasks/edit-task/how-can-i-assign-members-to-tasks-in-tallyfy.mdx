## Assigning members and guests to tasks

Assigning [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) shows who is responsible for the work. Assign tasks when building a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), when launching a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), or after a process starts.

### Assigning in a template

When editing a template, set the default assignee for each step.
<Steps>
1. Click the step you want to assign.
2. Go to the **Assign** tab in the settings panel.
3. Choose the default assignee: a specific [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/), a group, a [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) email, or a [job title](/products/pro/documenting/templates/edit-templates/understanding-assignment-types/).
4. You can also choose **Nobody right now** to leave it unassigned by default (see note below on "Assign launcher automatically").
</Steps>
This default assignment is used each time the process launches, unless changed during launch.

### Assigning when launching a process

Before you finalize launching, you often get a chance to review and change assignments.
<Steps>
1. After clicking **Launch Process** on a template, look for 'Review & Edit' before the final confirmation.
2. On the review screen, click tasks and change who is assigned for this instance.
3. You can remove all assignees to leave a task unassigned for this run.
</Steps>

### Assigning/reassigning tasks in a running process

You can change task assignments after the process is running.
<Steps>
1. Open the running process and find the task.
2. Click the menu icon (...) on the task card and choose 'Edit task' (or sometimes click the assignee area).
3. Add or remove assignees from the list.
4. Click **Save Changes**.
</Steps>

### Unassigned tasks ("nobody assigned")

Tallyfy allows tasks with no assignment.
*   These tasks appear with a generic icon and say **"Nobody Assigned"**.
*   Find them using the **"Assigned to nobody"** filter in the [Tasks view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/).
*   Anyone with permission can assign them later, or someone can 'take' it by assigning it to themselves.

### The "Assign launcher automatically" setting

This setting (in the template step's **Advanced** tab) controls what happens if a step has no default assignee set in the template:

*   **If ON (Default)**:
    *   If no one is assigned in the template, the process *launcher* is automatically assigned.
    *   If only guests are assigned in the template, *both* the launcher and guests are assigned.
*   **If OFF**:
    *   If no one is assigned in the template, the task starts as 'Nobody Assigned'.
    *   If only guests are assigned, *only* the guests are assigned (the launcher is not).

### Restricting task completion/editing

If you want only assigned people to complete or edit the task:

<Steps>
1. When editing the template, click the task step.
2. Go to the **Advanced** tab.
3. Switch **ON** the toggle **"Only assigned members can complete or edit this task"**.
</Steps>

:::note[Admin override]
**Administrators** can always complete or edit any task, regardless of this setting.
