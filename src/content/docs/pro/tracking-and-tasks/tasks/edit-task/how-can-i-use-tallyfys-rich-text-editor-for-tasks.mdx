## How can I use the rich text editor for tasks and descriptions?

Tallyfy's rich text editor appears wherever you type text - in task descriptions, comments, long text fields, and template descriptions. It's like having a mini word processor right inside Tallyfy. You can format text, add images, embed videos, and insert dynamic content.

Here's what you can do:

### What basic formatting options are available?

You'll find all the standard formatting tools in the toolbar:
*   **Bold**
*   *Italics*
*   Bulleted lists
*   Numbered lists
*   **Headings** (H2, H3, etc. - great for organizing longer content)

### How can I insert dynamic content (variables, snippets)?

Look for these icons in your toolbar (they're usually on the right side):

*   **Insert Variable** (**{ }** icon): This pulls in information collected earlier in your process. Super handy.
    *   Choose data from **Kick-off form fields**.
    *   Choose data from **previous step fields** in the same process.
    *   Choose **System variables** (like `Current TaskID`, `Current ProcessID`) - these are mostly for technical integrations.
    *   Need more details? Check out [Using Variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/how-can-i-use-insert-variables-in-tallyfy/).
*   **Insert Snippet/Template** (**✂️** icon): Drop in reusable content blocks with a single click.
    *   **Snippets**: These are saved blocks of text you use often. See [Using Snippets](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/how-can-i-use-snippets-to-simplify-workflow-in-tallyfy/).
    *   **Templates**: Link to another template right inside your current one. It's like nesting workflows - perfect for referencing standard procedures or compliance checklists within task descriptions.

### How do I use the "Insert" menu for media and elements?

The **Insert** menu (usually on the left side of your toolbar) is where the magic happens:

*   **Insert Image**: Upload an image or link to one that's already online.
*   **Upload File**: Attach documents, spreadsheets, PDFs - whatever you need.
*   **Insert Video**: Upload video files (MP4, WebM, up to 100MB). *Pro tip: Use 'Embed URL' instead - it loads much faster.* More info at [Adding Videos](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/edit-task/how-can-i-add-videos-to-my-tallyfy-process/).
*   **Insert Link**: Create clickable web links.
*   **Insert Table**: Need a simple table? Done.
*   **Embed URL**: This one's powerful. Paste links from YouTube, Vimeo, Twitter, Google Maps, and tons of other sites. The content shows up right in your task. No clicking away needed.
*   **Page Break**: Add page breaks (you'll mainly use this in [Document templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/)).

### How should I paste content from Word or Google Docs?

Here's something that might surprise you - when you paste from Word or Google Docs:

*   **Most formatting disappears**: Tallyfy strips out fonts, colors, and fancy layouts. Why? It keeps everything looking consistent and prevents weird technical glitches.
*   **Best approach**: Paste as plain text first, then add formatting with the editor buttons. Takes an extra minute but saves headaches later.

### What are the differences between Tallyfy and Word documents?

Tallyfy isn't Word - and that's actually a good thing. Here's what's different:

*   It's built for online workflows, not printing documents.
*   Those headings (H2, H3)? They automatically create a table of contents. Pretty neat.
*   Your organization's branding applies everywhere - no need to format each document.
*   Images from Word might look huge at first. Just resize them after pasting.
*   Instead of saving versions, Tallyfy tracks every change in activity logs. You can see who changed what and when.
