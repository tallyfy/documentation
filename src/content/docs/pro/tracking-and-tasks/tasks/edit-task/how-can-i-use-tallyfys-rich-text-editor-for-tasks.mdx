## How can I use the rich text editor for tasks and descriptions?

Tallyfy's rich text editor appears wherever you type text - in task descriptions, comments, long text fields, and template descriptions. It's like having a mini word processor right inside Tallyfy. You can format text, add images, embed videos, and insert dynamic content.

Here's what you can do:

### What basic formatting options are available?

You'll find all the standard formatting tools in the toolbar:
*   **Bold**
*   *Italics*
*   Bulleted lists
*   Numbered lists
*   **Headings** (H2, H3, etc. - great for organizing longer content)

### How can I insert dynamic content (variables, snippets)?

Look for these icons in your toolbar (they're usually on the right side):

*   **Insert Variable** (**{ }** icon): This pulls in information collected earlier in your process. Super handy.
    *   Choose data from **Kick-off form fields**.
    *   Choose data from **previous step fields** in the same process.
    *   Choose **System variables** (like `Current TaskID`, `Current ProcessID`) - these are mostly for technical integrations.
    *   Need more details? Check out [Using Variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/how-can-i-use-insert-variables-in-tallyfy/).
*   **Insert Snippet/Template** (**✂️** icon): Drop in reusable content blocks with a single click.
    *   **Snippets**: These are saved blocks of text you use often. See [Using Snippets](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/how-can-i-use-snippets-to-simplify-workflow-in-tallyfy/).
    *   **Templates**: Link to another template right inside your current one. It's like nesting workflows - perfect for referencing standard procedures or compliance checklists within task descriptions.

### How do I use the "Insert" menu for media and elements?

The **Insert** menu (usually on the left side of your toolbar) is where the magic happens:

*   **Insert Image**: Upload an image or link to one that's already online.
*   **Upload File**: Attach documents, spreadsheets, PDFs - whatever you need.
*   **Insert Video**: Upload video files (MP4, WebM, up to 100MB). *Pro tip: Use 'Embed URL' instead - it loads much faster.* More info at [Adding Videos](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/edit-task/how-can-i-add-videos-to-my-tallyfy-process/).
*   **Insert Link**: Create clickable web links.
*   **Insert Table**: Need a simple table? Done.
*   **Embed URL**: This one's powerful. Paste links from YouTube, Vimeo, Twitter, Google Maps, and tons of other sites. The content shows up right in your task. No clicking away needed.
*   **Page Break**: Add page breaks (you'll mainly use this in [Document templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/)).

### How should I paste content from Word or Google Docs?

Here's something that might surprise you - when you paste from Word or Google Docs:

*   **Most formatting disappears**: Tallyfy strips out fonts, colors, and fancy layouts. Why? It keeps everything looking consistent and prevents weird technical glitches.
*   **Best approach**: Paste as plain text first, then add formatting with the editor buttons. Takes an extra minute but saves headaches later.

### What are the differences between Tallyfy and Word documents?

Tallyfy isn't Word - and that's actually a good thing. Here's what's different:

*   It's built for online workflows, not printing documents.
*   Those headings (H2, H3)? They automatically create a table of contents. Pretty neat.
*   Your organization's branding applies everywhere - no need to format each document.
*   Images from Word might look huge at first. Just resize them after pasting.
*   Instead of saving versions, Tallyfy tracks every change in activity logs. You can see who changed what and when.

### How can I create one-click email links using HTML mode?

Want users to send pre-filled emails with a single click? You can create smart mailto: links in task descriptions using HTML mode and [variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/). When someone clicks the link, their default email client opens with everything already filled in - subject line, recipients, even the message body.

Here's how it works:

#### Prerequisites for mailto: links
- Your organization must have **HTML authoring enabled** (check **Settings > Organization > Customization**)
- You need variables set up in earlier steps if you want dynamic content
- Users need a default email client configured on their device

#### Creating a basic mailto: link

In HTML mode, here's the structure:
```html
<a href="mailto:recipient@example.com?subject=Task Complete&body=The task has been completed.">Click to send status email</a>
```

This creates a link that opens an email to recipient@example.com with "Task Complete" as the subject and a pre-written message.

#### Using variables in mailto: links

The real power comes from combining mailto: links with Tallyfy variables. Say you collected customer information in earlier steps - you can use that data in your email:

```html
<a href="mailto:{{customerEmail}}?subject=Order {{orderNumber}} Update&body=Hi {{customerName}},%0A%0AYour order {{orderNumber}} is ready for pickup.%0A%0ABest regards,%0A{{assigneeName}}">Email customer about order</a>
```

**Note:** Use `%0A` for line breaks in the email body (that's URL encoding for a new line).

#### Advanced mailto: options

You can include multiple recipients, CC, BCC, and more:

```html
<a href="mailto:{{primaryContact}}?cc={{managerEmail}}&bcc=records@company.com&subject=Project {{projectName}} - Approval Needed&body=Please review and approve the attached deliverables for {{projectName}}.">Request approval</a>
```

#### Common use cases for mailto: links

- **Customer notifications**: Pre-fill order updates, appointment confirmations, or service completions
- **Approval requests**: Generate emails with all context needed for quick approvals  
- **Status updates**: One-click reports to managers or clients with current process data
- **Escalations**: Create urgent emails with all relevant case information included

Remember - the email still opens in the user's email client where they can review and edit before sending. Nothing gets sent automatically, giving users full control while saving them tons of typing.
