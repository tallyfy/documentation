## Using the Rich Text Editor for Tasks and Descriptions

Many places in Tallyfy where you enter text (like task descriptions, comments, long text form fields, template descriptions) use a rich text editor. This lets you do more than just type plain text.

Here's what you can do:

### Basic Formatting

Use the toolbar buttons for standard formatting like:
*   **Bold**
*   *Italics*
*   Bulleted lists
*   Numbered lists
*   Headings (H2, H3, etc. - useful for structure)

### Inserting Dynamic Content (Variables, Snippets)

Look for specific icons in the toolbar (usually on the right):

*   **Insert Variable** (**{ }** icon): Click this to insert information collected earlier in the process.
    *   Choose data from **Kick-off form fields**.
    *   Choose data from **form fields in previous steps** of the same process.
    *   Choose **System variables** (like `Current TaskID`, `Current ProcessID`) for technical uses.
    *   See [Using Variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/how-can-i-use-insert-variables-in-tallyfy/) for more details.
*   **Insert Snippet/Template** (**✂️** icon): Click this to insert reusable content.
    *   **Snippets**: Insert saved blocks of standard text. See [Using Snippets](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/how-can-i-use-snippets-to-simplify-workflow-in-tallyfy/).
    *   **Templates**: Insert a link to another template (less common).

### Using the "Insert" Menu (Media and Elements)

Look for the **Insert** menu (usually on the left side of the toolbar):

*   **Insert Image**: Upload an image from your computer or link to one online.
*   **Upload File**: Attach documents, spreadsheets, PDFs, etc.
*   **Insert Video**: Upload a video file (MP4, WebM, up to 100MB). *Recommendation: Use "Embed URL" instead for better performance.* See [Adding Videos](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/edit-task/how-can-i-add-videos-to-my-tallyfy-process/).
*   **Insert Link**: Create a clickable web link.
*   **Insert Table**: Create a simple table.
*   **Embed URL**: Paste a link from many popular websites (YouTube, Vimeo, Twitter, Google Maps, etc.) to show a preview or interactive content directly in Tallyfy. This is often the best way to include external content.
*   **Page Break**: Add a page break (mainly for formatting [Document templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/)).

### Pasting Content from Word or Google Docs

Be careful when pasting text from programs like Word or Google Docs:

*   **Formatting often gets removed**: Tallyfy intentionally removes most complex formatting (like specific fonts, colors, complex layouts) when you paste. This is done to keep everything looking consistent within Tallyfy and prevent technical issues.
*   **Best approach**: Paste the text first, then use Tallyfy's editor buttons to apply formatting (like bold, headings, lists).

### Tallyfy vs. Word Documents

Remember these key differences when creating content:

*   Tallyfy is designed for online viewing and interaction, not primarily for printing like Word.
*   Use Tallyfy's Headings (H2, H3) for structure; this also helps build automatic Tables of Contents in some areas.
*   Tallyfy applies your organization's branding automatically; you don't style each piece of content individually.
*   Images might need resizing after pasting from Word.
*   Tallyfy tracks changes through an activity log, not separate file versions.
