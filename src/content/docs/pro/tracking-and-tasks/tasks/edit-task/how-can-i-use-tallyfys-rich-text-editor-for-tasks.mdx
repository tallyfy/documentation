## Using the rich text editor for tasks and descriptions

Many places in Tallyfy where you type text (task descriptions, comments, long text fields, template descriptions) use a rich text editor. This lets you format text and add content beyond plain text.

Here's what you can do:

### Basic formatting

Use toolbar buttons for formatting like:
*   **Bold**
*   *Italics*
*   Bulleted lists
*   Numbered lists
*   **Headings** (H2, H3, etc. - useful for organizing content)

### Inserting dynamic content (variables, snippets)

Find icons in the toolbar (usually on the right):

*   **Insert Variable** (**{ }** icon): Click to insert info collected earlier in the process.
    *   Choose data from **Kick-off form fields**.
    *   Choose data from **previous step fields** in the same process.
    *   Choose **System variables** (like `Current TaskID`, `Current ProcessID`), often used for technical integrations.
    *   See [Using Variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/how-can-i-use-insert-variables-in-tallyfy/) for details.
*   **Insert Snippet/Template** (**✂️** icon): Click to insert reusable content blocks.
    *   **Snippets**: Insert saved blocks of standard text. See [Using Snippets](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/how-can-i-use-snippets-to-simplify-workflow-in-tallyfy/).
    *   **Templates**: Insert a link to a template (less common use).

### Using the "Insert" menu (media and elements)

Find the **Insert** menu (usually left side of the toolbar):

*   **Insert Image**: Upload an image or link to an online image.
*   **Upload File**: Attach documents, spreadsheets, PDFs, etc.
*   **Insert Video**: Upload a video file (MP4, WebM, up to 100MB). *Recommendation: Use 'Embed URL' instead for better performance.* See [Adding Videos](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/edit-task/how-can-i-add-videos-to-my-tallyfy-process/).
*   **Insert Link**: Make a clickable web link.
*   **Insert Table**: Create a simple table.
*   **Embed URL**: Paste links from many sites (YouTube, Vimeo, Twitter, Google Maps, etc.) to show previews or interactive content directly. Often best for external content.
*   **Page Break**: Add page breaks (mainly for [Document templates](/products/pro/documenting/documents/)).

### Pasting content from Word or Google Docs

Be careful pasting from programs like Word or Google Docs:

*   **Most formatting is removed**: Tallyfy removes complex formatting (fonts, colors, layouts) on paste. This keeps content looking consistent and avoids technical issues.
*   **Best approach**: Paste plain text first, then apply formatting using the editor buttons (bold, headings, lists).

### Tallyfy vs. Word documents

Note these differences when creating text content:

*   Tallyfy is designed for online use, not primarily for printing.
*   Use Headings (H2, H3) for structure; this helps build automatic Tables of Contents.
*   Tallyfy applies your organization's branding; you don't style content individually.
*   Images might need resizing after pasting from Word.
*   Tallyfy tracks changes via activity logs, not file versions.
