## What is the rich text editor in Tallyfy?

Comments and description fields in Tallyfy allow you to use more than just plain text. They enable you to enter rich text. If you have long text form fields - you can optionally enable rich text within the settings for the field too.

Use rich text (HTML) for rich formatting options, embed options (to insert videos, etc.) and to insert images (up to 100Mb). You can also create lists, drop of content like other templates, variables, snippets and more. In addition - you can add hyperlinks and tables.

:::note[Embedding content with the Embed URL option]
Instead of uploading media directly, you can use the **Insert > Embed URL** option to embed content from over 400 providers. Simply paste the URL of any publicly facing content such as:

- YouTube or Vimeo videos
- Instagram or Twitter/X posts
- Spotify tracks or SoundCloud audio
- Google Maps locations
- Product listings
- And many more

Tallyfy will automatically generate a preview of the content directly in your editor. This approach provides better performance, additional features like interactive controls, and saves storage space in your Tallyfy account.

## Copy and pasting content from apps like Microsoft Word or Google Docs

If you try to copy/paste content from Google Docs or Microsoft Word into the rich text editor, the formatting may not be preserved. This is because the editor does not support the same formatting options as the web application you copied from.

Pasting in poorly formatted HTML from word processing apps has the following effects:

* It makes consistent formatting more difficult. When you have inline styles in your text, making universal, site-wide CSS changes require more overrides. Tallyfy offers global branding via CSS - which only works when you do not manually over-ride styling. Separate content from styling by entering content into Tallyfy without formatting.
* Extra code slows down websites. While this excess code doesn't normally change any site functionality, but every unnecessary line makes your site slower to load.
* It can affect search features. If you paste in lots of heavy/extra content into HTML - it doesn't help a search engine index the content better.

For this reason - when an attempt is made to copy in markup-heavy content, Tallyfy will strip out any formatting and try to capture the plain text into your rich text field.

### Key differences between Tallyfy and Word documents

When transitioning content from Word to Tallyfy, keep these important differences in mind:

- **Document purpose**: Tallyfy templates and documents are optimized for digital reading and collaboration rather than printing, though you can still print if needed.

- **Semantic structure**: Use Tallyfy's heading system (H2, H3) to create a navigable structure. This automatically builds a table of contents, making long documents easier to navigate.

- **Branding consistency**: Unlike Word's individual document styling, Tallyfy uses global brand styling that applies your company's visual identity across all content automatically.

- **Image handling**: When copying images from Word, you might need to adjust sizing in Tallyfy. Use the image properties dialog to customize dimensions.

- **Version management**: Tallyfy doesn't maintain multiple document versions like Word. Instead, it keeps one current version with a detailed audit trail of all changes.

:::tip[Recommended approach]
When moving content from Word to Tallyfy, copy the plain text content first, then apply structure and formatting using Tallyfy's built-in tools. This ensures better consistency and performance.
