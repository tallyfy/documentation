## What options are available for editing tasks?

You can edit any [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in Tallyfy - change who's assigned, update descriptions, add videos or images, and adjust due dates. Works for both standalone tasks and tasks inside running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).

Need to reassign work because someone's out sick? Update task descriptions when requirements change? Add a quick video to clarify instructions? That's exactly what task editing is for. You'll find the rich text editor particularly helpful for formatting descriptions, adding bullet points, or highlighting important details.
