## Options for editing tasks

Edit any [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in Tallyfy - change assignees, update descriptions, add videos or images, and adjust due dates. This works for both standalone tasks and tasks inside running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).

Someone out sick? Reassign their tasks. Requirements changed? Update the description. Need clarity? Add a video. The rich text editor lets you format descriptions with bullet points, headings, and highlights.
