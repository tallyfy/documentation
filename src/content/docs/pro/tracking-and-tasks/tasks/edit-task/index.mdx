## Options for editing tasks

This section covers ways you can edit individual [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) â€“ either one-off tasks or tasks within a running [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).

You can change assignees, add media like videos, use the rich text editor for descriptions, and more.
