## What options are available for editing tasks?

This section covers ways you can edit individual [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) – either one-off tasks or tasks within a running [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). Task editing provides flexibility for adapting work requirements as situations evolve.

You can change assignees, add media like videos, use the rich text editor for descriptions, and more. These editing capabilities ensure tasks remain relevant and actionable throughout their lifecycle.
