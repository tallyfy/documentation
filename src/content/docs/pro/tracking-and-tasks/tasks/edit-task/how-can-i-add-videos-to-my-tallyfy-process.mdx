## How to add or embed videos in tasks

You can add videos to the description of a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to provide visual instructions. There are two main ways:

1.  **Embed from Video Sites**: Link to videos on platforms like YouTube, Vimeo, etc.
2.  **Upload Video Files**: Upload video files (MP4, WebM; up to 100MB) to Tallyfy.

### Method 1: Embedding videos from links (recommended)

This is usually best as it gives better video quality and uses less Tallyfy storage.

<Steps>
1. Edit the task description.
2. Click where you want the video.
3. In the editor toolbar, click **Insert > Embed URL**.
4. Paste the video's web link (URL) (e.g., from YouTube or Vimeo).
5. Click **Insert**.
6. A video preview should appear in the description.
</Steps>

:::tip[Many embed sources supported]
Tallyfy can embed content from hundreds of sources using the "Embed URL" option, not just videos.

### Method 2: Uploading video files

You can upload video files if needed, but remember the 100MB file size limit. Supported formats: MP4, WebM.

<Steps>
1. Edit the task description.
2. Click where you want the video.
3. Click **Insert > Video** in the toolbar.
4. Choose the **Upload** option.
5. Select the video file from your computer.
6. Wait for the upload and processing.
</Steps>

Using embedded videos (Method 1) is generally recommended over uploading files for better performance.
