## Adding videos to tasks

Tallyfy allows you to add videos to your processes from popular providers including YouTube, Vimeo, Dailymotion, Yahoo, Rutybe, and Vidyard.

To add videos from these providers, simply follow these steps:

1. Go to the step in your process where you want to add the video.
2. Click on the "Add Video" button.
3. Choose your preferred provider from the options available.
4. Enter the URL of the video or search for videos directly from Tallyfy.
5. Select the video you want to add and save your changes.

Now you can enhance your processes with engaging videos to provide better guidance and instructions.

You can also upload video files directly to Tallyfy. Here are the supported file formats:

- MP3
- MP4
- WebM (100MB limit)

Click the **Upload Video File** button and select the file you want to upload. Tallyfy will process the file for playback within your process.

:::tip[Best practice for videos]
While you can upload video files directly to Tallyfy (up to 100MB), we highly recommend using a dedicated video hosting service like YouTube or Vimeo and embedding the video instead. This provides better video performance, reliability, and features like adaptive streaming quality.

To embed a video instead of uploading:
1. Position your cursor where you want the video to appear
2. Click **Insert > Embed URL** in the rich text editor
3. Paste the URL of your video from YouTube, Vimeo, or another platform
4. Click **Insert**

Tallyfy's rich text editor supports embedding from over 400 different providers of videos, audio, photos, and products using the embed URL option. This approach also saves storage space in your Tallyfy account.
