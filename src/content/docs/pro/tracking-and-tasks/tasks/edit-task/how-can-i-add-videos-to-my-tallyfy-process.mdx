## How to add or embed videos in tasks

You can add videos to the description of a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to provide visual instructions or context. There are two main ways to do this:

1.  **Embed from Video Sites**: Link to videos hosted on platforms like YouTube, Vimeo, etc.
2.  **Upload Video Files**: Upload video files directly to Tallyfy (MP4, WebM, up to 100MB).

### Method 1: Embedding Videos from Links (Recommended)

This is usually the best option as it provides better video quality and uses less Tallyfy storage.

<Steps>
1. Open the task description for editing.
2. Click where you want the video to appear.
3. In the editor toolbar, click **Insert > Embed URL**.
4. Paste the web link (URL) of your video (e.g., from YouTube or Vimeo).
5. Click **Insert**.
6. A preview of the video should appear in the description.
</Steps>

:::tip[Many Embed Sources Supported]
Tallyfy can embed content from hundreds of sources using the "Embed URL" option, not just videos.

### Method 2: Uploading Video Files

You can upload video files directly if needed, but keep the 100MB size limit per file in mind. Supported formats include MP4 and WebM.

<Steps>
1. Open the task description for editing.
2. Click where you want the video.
3. Click **Insert > Video** in the toolbar.
4. Choose the **Upload** option.
5. Select the video file from your computer.
6. Wait for the file to upload and process.
</Steps>

Using embedded videos (Method 1) is generally recommended over uploading files directly for better performance and reliability.
