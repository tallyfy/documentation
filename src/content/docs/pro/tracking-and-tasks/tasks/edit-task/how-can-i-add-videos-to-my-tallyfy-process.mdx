## Add or embed videos in tasks

You can add videos to a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) two ways - embed from YouTube/Vimeo using **Insert > Embed URL**, or upload files directly through **Insert > Video**. Embedding is usually better since it's faster and doesn't use your storage.

1.  **Embed from video sites** - Link to videos on YouTube, Vimeo, or similar platforms
2.  **Upload video files** - Upload MP4, WebM, or OGG files (up to 100MB) directly to Tallyfy

### Method 1: Embed videos from links (recommended)

Embedded videos load faster and don't count against your storage. No file size limits to worry about either.

<Steps>
1. Edit the task description.
2. Click where you want the video.
3. In the editor toolbar, click **Insert > Embed URL**.
4. Paste the video's web link (e.g., from YouTube or Vimeo).
5. Click **Insert**.
6. A video preview appears in the description.
</Steps>

:::tip[Many embed sources supported]
Tallyfy's "Embed URL" option works with hundreds of sources beyond just videos - Figma designs, Google Docs, Typeform surveys, and more.

### Method 2: Upload video files

For proprietary content or recordings you've just made, upload the file directly. The limit is 100MB per file. Supported formats are MP4, WebM, OGG, and QuickTime.

<Steps>
1. Edit the task description.
2. Click where you want the video.
3. Click **Insert > Video** in the toolbar.
4. Choose the **Upload** option.
5. Select the video file from your computer.
6. Wait for the upload and processing.
</Steps>

Prefer embedded videos when possible - they load faster and won't use storage space.
