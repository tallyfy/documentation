## How can I add or embed videos in tasks?

To add videos to a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), you've got two options: embed from YouTube/Vimeo using **Insert > Embed URL**, or upload video files directly through **Insert > Video**. Most users prefer embedding - it's faster and doesn't eat up your storage.

Need visual instructions for your team? Videos can transform confusing tasks into crystal-clear steps. Here's how to add them:

1.  **Embed from Video Sites**: Link to videos on YouTube, Vimeo, or similar platforms
2.  **Upload Video Files**: Upload MP4 or WebM files (up to 100MB) directly to Tallyfy

### Method 1: How do I embed videos from links? (recommended)

Want the best video quality without hogging Tallyfy storage? Embedding is your friend. Your videos load faster, play smoother, and you don't have to worry about file size limits.

<Steps>
1. Edit the task description.
2. Click where you want the video.
3. In the editor toolbar, click **Insert > Embed URL**.
4. Paste the video's web link (URL) (e.g., from YouTube or Vimeo).
5. Click **Insert**.
6. A video preview should appear in the description.
</Steps>

:::tip[Many embed sources supported]
Here's something cool - Tallyfy's "Embed URL" option works with hundreds of sources, not just videos. Think Figma designs, Google Docs, Typeform surveys... the list goes on.

### Method 2: How do I upload video files?

Sometimes you need to upload your own video files - maybe it's proprietary content or something you just recorded. No problem. Just keep an eye on that 100MB limit (yes, it catches everyone off guard at first). Stick with MP4 or WebM formats and you're golden.

<Steps>
1. Edit the task description.
2. Click where you want the video.
3. Click **Insert > Video** in the toolbar.
4. Choose the **Upload** option.
5. Select the video file from your computer.
6. Wait for the upload and processing.
</Steps>

Quick tip? Go with embedded videos whenever you can. Your tasks load faster, and you won't burn through storage space. Save the uploads for when you really need them.
