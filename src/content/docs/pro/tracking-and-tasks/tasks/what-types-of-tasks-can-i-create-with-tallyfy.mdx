## What are one-off tasks?

These are standalone, ad-hoc to-do items or event-specific tasks that you need to keep track of. Whether it's ordering print cartridges or confirming caterer choices for an event, Tallyfy has got you covered!

A one-off task can be created in several ways:
- As a completely standalone ad-hoc task
- Linked to a specific template 
- Added to an existing process at any time

One-off tasks can be any task type - regular tasks, approval tasks, email tasks, or expiring tasks - giving you full flexibility for your ad-hoc work tracking needs.

### Link a one-off task to a template

Sometimes you need to ask someone else to fill out or complete information in a template. Use a one-off task, and link it to that specific template.

### Link a one-off task to a process

Sometimes you need a one-time, ad-hoc task just for this specific process. If the template settings allow you to do this (it's configurable in _Settings_ on the template editor) - then you can go ahead and add any ad-hoc or one-off task into that process.

:::tip[Add ad-hoc tasks to active processes]
You're not limited to just the tasks that were included when the process launched! You can always add ad-hoc one-off tasks to an active process at any time to handle unique or unexpected situations. This allows you to adapt processes to specific circumstances without modifying the original template.

Note that template creators can control this capability. In the template settings under the "Permissions" tab, there's a setting: **"Can people add one-off tasks to this process?"** which is set to "Yes" by default. If this is set to "No", only users with Administrator roles can add one-off tasks to processes created from that template. This restriction is useful for compliance-critical processes that must strictly follow a predefined workflow.

## What are the step types within Tallyfy?

Tallyfy offers five distinct step types to accommodate various workflow needs:

| Step Type | Button Displayed | Optional? | Description | Use Cases |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Task** | COMPLETE | No | The default type of task. Non-optional and must be completed by assignees. | Any action that a person needs to complete, such as data entry, document review, or any general workflow task. |
| **Approve/Reject** | APPROVE and REJECT | No | Used for decisions that result in approval or rejection. Non-optional and must be completed by assignees. | Financial decisions, design approvals, quality control reviews. Status can be used with Tallyfy Automations to trigger different actions based on approval or rejection. |
| **Expiring** | COMPLETE | Yes | Tasks that don't always have to be completed by a certain time. They automatically complete themselves on the deadline date if not completed manually. | Weekly reports, timesheet submissions, status updates that are helpful but not critical. |
| **Email Draft** | SEND | No | Email drafts that need to be checked and sent by people. Assignees check the email, edit it, and send it manually. | Status updates, progress reports, notifications that require human review before sending. |
| **Email Auto-Send** | SEND NOW | No | Preset emails that will send automatically on the deadline date. Assignees can choose to send immediately or let it send automatically at the deadline. | Scheduled communications, automated notifications, reminders that should be sent at a predetermined time. |

### Tasks

The default step type in Tallyfy is just a _Task_. These are common in workflows - they are things to do. Tasks display a COMPLETE button and are non-optional, meaning they must be completed by the assigned person or team.

### Approve/Reject

This type of task exposes two buttons instead of a _Complete_ button - which are - _Approve_ and _Reject_.

You can use automations to handle what happens when approve is picked vs. reject and customize the flow and behavior of the workflow based on one of those two decisions.

:::tip[Restrict who can approve or reject]
If you want to prevent other members from being able to approve or reject a task, you can use the Advanced tab setting:
1. In the template editor, click on your Approve/Reject task
2. Select the **Advanced** tab
3. Enable the toggle for **"Only assigned members can complete or edit this task"**

This ensures that only the specifically assigned members can approve or reject the task. Note that this restriction does not apply to users with Administrator roles.

### Expiring

In certain situations, a task needs to be done but it's not totally critical. If it _can_ be done prior to the deadline, it _should_ be done - otherwise, we don't mind if it's skipped or missed. An expiring task is great for nice-to-do things that are not critical.

They are designed to prevent task debt from mounting up, which is a huge problem in other task management apps. Nobody wants to see "800 tasks incomplete" when most of those tasks are really optional and not critical at all.

An example of an expiring task might be "Provide weekly update". If you miss it this week, it's okay - you can provide an update next week.

An expiring task marks itself complete on the deadline date, unless it's completed manually prior to the deadline date.

### Email Tasks

Email tasks are divided into two types:

* **Email Auto-Send** - Preset emails that will send automatically on the deadline date. Shows a SEND NOW button because you can choose to send immediately instead of waiting for the deadline. If left alone, the email will send automatically on the deadline date. Use cases include scheduled communications, automated notifications, and reminders that should be sent at a predetermined time.

* **Email Draft** - Email drafts that need to be checked and sent by people. Shows a SEND button. Assignees check the email, edit it as needed, and manually send it. Use cases include status updates, progress reports, and notifications that require human review before sending.

You will receive a copy of the email you send to all other recipients.

:::note[Not receiving emails? Check your notification settings]

Note that whether or not you receive a copy of the email depends on the "Receive emails when I'm assigned" option under Settings > Email Notifications.

If you have this disabled, you will not receive a copy of the email sent. You can learn more about managing email notifications [here](/products/pro/settings/personal-settings/how-can-i-manage-email-notifications-in-tallyfy/)
