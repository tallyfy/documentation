## Types of tasks in Tallyfy

Tallyfy has two categories of tasks - process tasks and one-off tasks - each supporting five step types.

### Process steps vs one-off tasks

*   **Process Steps/Tasks**: Defined within a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) as "Steps," becoming "Tasks" when the [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) runs.
*   **One-Off Tasks**: Standalone to-dos not linked to any template.
    *   [Create one-off tasks individually](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-create-a-one-off-task-in-tallyfy/)
    *   [Add them to a running process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/edit-processes/how-can-i-add-tasks-to-active-processes-on-tallyfy/) as ad-hoc tasks
    *   Link a one-off task to a specific template or process

:::tip[Adding ad-hoc tasks to active processes]
You can add ad-hoc tasks to a running [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) without modifying the original [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).

Template creators control this via the **"Can people add one-off tasks to this process?"** toggle in the template editor (default is "Yes"). If set to "No," ad-hoc tasks are blocked entirely for that process.

### Five step/task types

| Type                | Main Button(s)           | Must be completed? | Description |
|---------------------|--------------------------|--------------------|-------------|
| **Task**            | COMPLETE                 | Yes                | Standard to-do for most actions (data entry, reviews). |
| **Approve/Reject**  | APPROVE / REJECT         | Yes                | For decisions and approvals. Can trigger [Automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/). |
| **Expiring**        | ACKNOWLEDGE              | No (optional)      | Auto-completes at deadline if not acknowledged. Prevents overdue task build-up. |
| **Email Draft**     | SEND                     | Yes                | Email draft for assignee review/edit before manual send. |
| **Email Auto-Send** | SEND RIGHT NOW / (Auto)  | Yes                | Sends email automatically at deadline, or earlier via **SEND RIGHT NOW**. |

#### Task type

The standard type. The assignee clicks **COMPLETE** to finish it.

#### Approve/Reject type

Shows two buttons - **APPROVE** and **REJECT**. Use [Automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) to trigger different actions based on the choice.

:::tip[Restricting approvals]
You can restrict completion to assigned users only by enabling "Only assigned members can complete..." in the task's **Advanced** tab. Admins can always override this setting.
:::

#### Expiring type

If nobody clicks **ACKNOWLEDGE** by the deadline, the task auto-completes and disappears from active task lists. Great for information sharing without creating [task debt](/products/pro/tutorials/how-to/how-to-avoid-task-debt/).

Common uses:
- FYI updates that don't require action
- Optional resources or training materials
- Weekly status reports for awareness
- Non-critical announcements

Team members get notified and can engage if they want, but the task won't pile up if they don't.

#### Email types

*   **Email Auto-Send**: Write the email in the template. It sends automatically at the deadline unless someone clicks **SEND RIGHT NOW** earlier.
*   **Email Draft**: Write a draft in the template. The assignee reviews/edits and clicks **SEND** manually.
*   **Send Chromeless**: Both email types can send without Tallyfy branding. Enable the **"Send Chromeless"** option to send plain emails without the Tallyfy logo, header, and footer - useful when emails should look like standard messages rather than workflow notifications.
*   **Email Copies**: Assignees receive a copy of sent emails, unless they've disabled email notifications.

:::note[Receiving email copies]
Receiving copies depends on the "Receive emails when I'm assigned" setting under **Settings > My Profile > Email Notifications**. See [Manage Email Notifications](/products/pro/settings/personal-settings/how-can-i-manage-email-notifications-in-tallyfy/).
