## What are one-off tasks?

These are standalone, ad-hoc to-do items or event-specific tasks that you need to keep track of. Whether it's ordering print cartridges or confirming caterer choices for an event, Tallyfy has got you covered!

A one-off task can be created in several ways:
- As a completely standalone ad-hoc task
- Linked to a specific template 
- Added to an existing process at any time

One-off tasks can be any task type - regular tasks, approval tasks, email tasks, or expiring tasks - giving you full flexibility for your ad-hoc work tracking needs.

### Link a one-off task to a template

Sometimes you need to ask someone else to fill out or complete information in a template. Use a one-off task, and link it to that specific template.

### Link a one-off task to a process

Sometimes you need a one-time, ad-hoc task just for this specific process. If the template settings allow you to do this (it's configurable in _Settings_ on the template editor) - then you can go ahead and add any ad-hoc or one-off task into that process.

:::tip[Add ad-hoc tasks to active processes]
You're not limited to just the tasks that were included when the process launched! You can always add ad-hoc one-off tasks to an active process at any time to handle unique or unexpected situations. This allows you to adapt processes to specific circumstances without modifying the original template.

## What are the step types within Tallyfy?

### Tasks

The default step type in Tallyfy is just a _Task_. These are common in workflows - they are things to do.

### Approve/Reject

This type of task exposes two buttons instead of a _Complete_ button - which are - _Approve_ and _Reject_.

You can use automations to handle what happens when approve is picked vs. reject and customize the flow and behavior of the workflow based on one of those two decisions.

:::tip[Restrict who can approve or reject]
If you want to prevent other members from being able to approve or reject a task, you can use the Advanced tab setting:
1. In the template editor, click on your Approve/Reject task
2. Select the **Advanced** tab
3. Enable the toggle for **"Only assigned members can complete or edit this task"**

This ensures that only the specifically assigned members can approve or reject the task. Note that this restriction does not apply to users with Administrator roles.

### Expiring

In certain situations, a task needs to be done but it's not totally critical. If it _can_ be done prior to the deadline, it _should_ be done - otherwise, we don't mind if it's skipped or missed. An expiring task is great for nice-to-do things that are not critical.

They are designed to prevent task debt from mounting up, which is a huge problem in other task management apps. Nobody wants to see "800 tasks incomplete" when most of those tasks are really optional and not critical at all.

An example of an expiring task might be "Provide weekly update". If you miss it this week, it's okay - you can provide an update next week.

An expiring task marks itself complete on the deadline date, unless it's completed prior to the deadline date.

### Email Tasks

Email tasks are divided into two types:

* **Auto-send** emails - where the email is sent as soon as the task becomes visible. If you want to control when it sends - use _Visibility_ automations to make sure you show up that task at the right time.
* **Draft** emails - where an email is drafted, but the assignee must check it over and edit what they need to, and then they hit _Send_.

If you need to send an email without leaving Tallyfy - you can create the default subject and body of your email so that life becomes a lot easier for the person sending the email. You can even use variables to swap out default text for custom text in form fields, to personalize your email.

You will receive a copy of the email you send to all other recipients.

:::note[Not receiving emails? Check your notification settings]

Note that whether or not you receive a copy of the email depends on the "Receive emails when I'm assigned" option under Settings > Email Notifications.

If you have this disabled, you will not receive a copy of the email sent. You can learn more about managing email notifications [here](/products/pro/settings/personal-settings/how-can-i-manage-email-notifications-in-tallyfy/)
