## What types of tasks can I create with Tallyfy?

### What's the difference between one-off tasks and process steps?

Tallyfy distinguishes between different [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) categories based on their relationship to workflow templates and processes.

Understanding these task types enables optimal workflow design and execution:

*   **Process Steps/Tasks**: Defined within a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) as 'Steps', becoming 'Tasks' when the [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) runs. They are part of a larger workflow.
*   **One-Off Tasks**: Standalone to-dos not linked to a template. Use them for quick actions or unique situations. 
    *   You can [create one-off tasks individually](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-create-a-one-off-task-in-tallyfy/).
    *   You can [add them to a running process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/edit-processes/how-can-i-add-tasks-to-active-processes-on-tallyfy/) (ad-hoc tasks).
    *   You can link a one-off task to a specific template or process if needed.

:::tip[Adding ad-hoc tasks to active processes]
You aren't limited to the tasks included when a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) launched. You can add ad-hoc tasks to handle unique situations without modifying the original [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).

Template creators can control this via **Settings > Permissions** in the template editor using the **"Can people add one-off tasks to this process?"** setting (default is "Yes"). If set to "No", only Admins can add ad-hoc tasks, useful for compliance-critical processes.

### Tallyfy step/task types

Whether creating a step in a template or a one-off task, Tallyfy offers five types:

| Type                | Main Button(s)     | Must be Completed? | Description & Common Uses |
|---------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Task**            | COMPLETE           | Yes                | Standard to-do. Use for most actions (data entry, reviews). |
| **Approve/Reject**  | APPROVE / REJECT   | Yes                | For decisions. Use for approvals (finance, design). Can trigger [Automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/). |
| **Expiring**        | COMPLETE           | No (Optional)      | Auto-completes at deadline if not done. Use for optional reminders/updates (e.g., weekly reports). Prevents overdue task build-up. |
| **Email Draft**     | SEND               | Yes                | Creates email draft for assignee review/edit before manual send. Use for updates needing human checks. |
| **Email Auto-Send** | SEND NOW / (Auto)  | Yes                | Sends pre-written email automatically at deadline (or earlier via **SEND NOW**). Use for scheduled reminders/notifications. |

#### Task type
This is the standard type, requiring the assignee to click **COMPLETE**.

#### Approve/Reject type
This type shows two buttons. Use [Automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) to trigger different actions based on the **APPROVE** or **REJECT** choice.

:::tip[Restricting approvals]
You can ensure only assigned users approve/reject by enabling "Only assigned members can complete..." in the task's **Advanced** tab (Admins can always override).
:::

#### Expiring type
Useful for tasks that are helpful but not critical if missed. They complete automatically at the deadline, preventing your task list from filling with old, non-essential overdue items.

#### Email types
*   **Email Auto-Send**: Write the email in the template. It sends automatically at the deadline unless someone clicks **SEND NOW** earlier.
*   **Email Draft**: Write a draft in the template. The assignee reviews/edits and clicks **SEND** manually.
*   **Email Copies**: The sender (or Tallyfy for auto-send) usually gets a copy, unless they disabled specific email notifications.

:::note[Receiving email copies]
Receiving copies depends on the "Receive emails when I'm assigned" setting under **Settings > My Profile > Email Notifications**. See [Manage Email Notifications](/products/pro/settings/personal-settings/how-can-i-manage-email-notifications-in-tallyfy/).
