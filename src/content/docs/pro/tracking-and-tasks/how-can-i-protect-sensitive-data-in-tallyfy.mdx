## Best practices for protecting sensitive information

When your workflows involve handling private or confidential information (like Social Security numbers, credit card details, health records, etc.), it's important to protect that data properly.

### Recommendations for handling sensitive data

The best approach is usually:

1.  **Store sensitive data securely elsewhere**: Keep the actual confidential information in a dedicated system designed for secure storage (like a secure database, an encrypted file store, or a specialized system like your HR or finance software) with strict access controls.
2.  **Limit access**: Ensure only authorized people can access the secure system where the data is stored.
3.  **Avoid putting data directly in Tallyfy tasks**: Do not type or paste sensitive details directly into Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) names, descriptions, or regular form fields.
4.  **Link securely**: Instead of putting the data *in* Tallyfy, put a secure *link* in the Tallyfy task description that points to the data in its secure location.

### How to link to sensitive data from Tallyfy

1. Make sure the sensitive information is stored securely in your other system.
2. Get a secure link (URL) that allows *authorized users* to access that specific piece of data.
3. Open the relevant [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in Tallyfy.
4. In the task description, add text explaining what the data is, and insert the secure link (URL) to where the user can view it (e.g., "Click here to view the secure customer record").
5. Save the task description.

This method allows your Tallyfy workflow to reference the needed information without storing the sensitive data itself within Tallyfy.
