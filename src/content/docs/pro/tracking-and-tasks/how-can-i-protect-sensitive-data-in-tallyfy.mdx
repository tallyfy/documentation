## Best practices for protecting sensitive information

When handling confidential information in business processes, it's critical to implement proper security measures. Sensitive data includes Social Security numbers, financial details, health information, and confidential customer data.

## Security recommendations

For maximum data protection:

1. Store sensitive information in dedicated, secure systems with proper access controls
2. Limit data access to authorized personnel only
3. Avoid including sensitive data directly in Tallyfy task descriptions
4. Use secure linking to reference sensitive information

## Linking to sensitive data in Tallyfy

To reference protected information within a Tallyfy task:

1. Store the sensitive information in your secure system
2. Open the relevant task in Tallyfy
3. Locate the task description field
4. Add a URL link to the secure system where the data is stored
5. Save the task

This approach maintains a clear workflow while keeping sensitive data in systems specifically designed for secure information storage.
