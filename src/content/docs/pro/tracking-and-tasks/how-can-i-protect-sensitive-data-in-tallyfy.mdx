## Best practices for protecting sensitive information

Never store sensitive data directly in Tallyfy. Keep it in your secure systems and link to it from your workflows instead. Social Security numbers, credit card details, patient records - none of these belong in [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) descriptions or form fields.

### Recommendations

1.  **Store data outside Tallyfy**: Confidential info belongs in dedicated secure systems - encrypted databases, your HR platform, or specialized finance software. These systems already have the access controls you need.
2.  **Limit access**: Only authorized users should reach the secure system where your data lives.
3.  **Never paste sensitive details into Tallyfy**: Don't type or paste confidential data into task names, descriptions, or form fields.
4.  **Link instead**: Add secure links in your Tallyfy task descriptions that point to where the data actually lives.

### How to link to sensitive data from Tallyfy

1. Store your sensitive info securely in your other system first.
2. Grab a secure link (URL) that lets *authorized users* access that specific data. Most systems can generate these.
3. Open the Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) where you need to reference this data.
4. In the task description, add your secure link. For example: "Review the customer's credit application here: [secure link]"
5. Save the task description.

Your workflow now references the sensitive data without storing it in Tallyfy. The data stays safe in your secure system, and your team can still access it when needed.

### Collecting sensitive documents

Need to collect sensitive documents from clients or external users? Use [file request links](mdc:products/pro/integrations/document-management/file-request-links/) from your document management system. People upload directly to your secure DMS without files ever passing through Tallyfy. This works well for law firms, healthcare providers, and financial services where compliance matters.
