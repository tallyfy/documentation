## Best practices for protecting sensitive information

When handling confidential information in [business processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), it's critical to implement proper security measures. Sensitive data includes Social Security numbers, financial details, health information, and confidential customer data.

### Security recommendations

For maximum data protection:

1. Store sensitive information in dedicated, secure systems with proper access controls
2. Limit data access to authorized personnel only
3. Avoid including sensitive data directly in Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) descriptions
4. Use secure linking to reference sensitive information

### Linking to sensitive data in Tallyfy

To reference protected information within a Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/):

1. Store the sensitive information in your secure system
2. Open the relevant task in Tallyfy
3. Locate the task description field
4. Add a URL link to the secure system where the data is stored
5. Save the task

This approach maintains a clear workflow while keeping sensitive data in systems specifically designed for secure information storage.
