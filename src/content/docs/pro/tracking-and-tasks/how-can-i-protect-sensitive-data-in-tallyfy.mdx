## Best practices for protecting sensitive information

When your workflows handle private or confidential info (like Social Security numbers, credit card details, health records), it's important to protect that data.

### Recommendations for handling sensitive data

The best approach is usually:

1.  **Store sensitive data securely outside Tallyfy**: Keep confidential info in a dedicated secure system (like a secure database, encrypted storage, or specialized system like HR or finance software) with strong access controls.
2.  **Limit access**: Ensure only authorized users access the secure system where the data is stored.
3.  **Don't put sensitive data directly in Tallyfy**: Avoid typing or pasting sensitive details directly into Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) names, descriptions, or standard form fields.
4.  **Link securely**: Instead of putting data *in* Tallyfy, put a secure link in the Tallyfy task description pointing to the data's secure location.

### How to link to sensitive data from Tallyfy

1. Ensure sensitive info is stored securely in your other system.
2. Get a secure link (URL) allowing *authorized users* access to that specific data.
3. Open the relevant Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/).
4. In the task description, add text explaining the data and insert the secure link (URL) where users can view it (e.g., "Click here to view the secure customer record").
5. Save the task description.

This method lets your Tallyfy workflow reference needed info without storing sensitive data in Tallyfy.
