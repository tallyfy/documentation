## Manage and track processes

Open the **[Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** from the left sidebar to get a high-level view of all running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) across your Tallyfy workspace.

### What does the Tracker view show?

Each running process appears as a card showing the process name, source template, current status (On-time, Due soon, or Overdue), tasks completed, next due date, and who's assigned the next task.

### How can I sort and filter processes?

*   **Sorting** - Use the sort dropdown to order processes by Newest/Oldest, Most Delayed, or alphabetically (A-Z or Z-A).

*   **Filtering** - Click **Add Filter** to show only processes matching specific criteria - like assigned person, tags, template, status, type, or folder. See [Customize the Tracker view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/how-to-create-custom-views-in-tallyfy/).

### What do the status colors mean?

*   **On-time** - Running normally, no deadlines missed.
*   **Due soon** - One or more tasks are due within 24 hours.
*   **Overdue** - A task deadline has been missed.
*   **Problem** - Someone reported a blocker on a task.
