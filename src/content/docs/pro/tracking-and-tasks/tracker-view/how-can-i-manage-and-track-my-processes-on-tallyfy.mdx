## How to manage and track processes in the Tracker View

The **[Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** view (accessed from the left sidebar) gives you a high-level overview of all your running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).

### What the Tracker View shows

*   Each running process is shown as a card.
*   Each card displays key information like the process name, the template it came from, current status (e.g., On-time, Due soon, Overdue), how many tasks are done, the next due date, and who is assigned to the next task.

### Sorting and Filtering Processes

You can change how processes are displayed in the Tracker:

*   **Sorting**: Use the sort dropdown (usually top right) to order processes by Due Date (soonest/latest), Newest/Oldest created, or alphabetically by Name (A-Z or Z-A).

*   **Filtering**: Use the **Add Filter** button to show only processes that match certain criteria (e.g., processes with issues, processes in a specific folder, processes with certain tags). See [Customize the Tracker View](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/how-to-create-custom-views-in-tallyfy/).

### Understanding Process Status Colors

Tallyfy often uses colors or labels to indicate the status of a process:

*   **On-time**: Running normally, no immediate deadlines missed.
*   **Due soon**: One or more tasks are due very soon (often within 24 hours).
*   **Overdue / Problem**: A task deadline has been missed, or someone reported a blocker/issue on a task.
