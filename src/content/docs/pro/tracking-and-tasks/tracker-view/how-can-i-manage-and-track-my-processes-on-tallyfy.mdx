## Using the Tracker view

Tallyfy is a cloud-based solution that provides comprehensive process management capabilities. This article explains how to track and organize processes using the dashboard.

## Tracker view

In the **Tracker** section, you'll find all your active processes and their statuses. For more information about processes, see [this article](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).

Each process has its own card, which provides information such as the process template, name, status, number of completed tasks, next task due date, and assignee(s).

## Sorting and filtering

Tallyfy provides several options for sorting and filtering processes:

- **By Due Date:** See your processes in order from soonest to latest, with the overdue ones first.
- **Newest First:** Arrange your processes based on their creation date, with the freshest ones on top.
- **Oldest First:** Sort your processes based on their creation date, with the oldest ones on top.
- **Sort A-Z:** Arrange your processes alphabetically by their names from A to Z.
- **Sort Z-A:** Sort your processes alphabetically by their names from Z to A.

## Check progress status

Tallyfy uses three progress statuses:

- **On-time:** The process is proceeding as expected with no immediate deadlines.
- **Due soon:** Tasks are due within the next 24 hours.
- **Overdue:** A task deadline has passed, or an issue has been reported for a step.
