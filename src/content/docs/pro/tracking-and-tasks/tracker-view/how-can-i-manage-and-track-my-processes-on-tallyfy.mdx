## How to manage and track processes in the Tracker view

The **[Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** view (accessed from the left sidebar) gives a high-level overview of all your running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).

### What the Tracker view shows

*   Each running process appears as a card.
*   Each card shows key info like the process name, source template, current status (e.g., On-time, Due soon, Overdue), tasks completed, the next due date, and who is assigned the next task.

### Sorting and filtering processes

You can change how processes appear in the Tracker:

*   **Sorting**: Use the sort dropdown (usually top right) to order processes by Due Date, Newest/Oldest, or alphabetically by name (A-Z or Z-A).

*   **Filtering**: Use the **Add Filter** button to show only processes matching criteria (e.g., processes with issues, processes in a folder, processes with specific tags). See [Customize the Tracker View](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/how-to-create-custom-views-in-tallyfy/).

### Understanding process status colors

Tallyfy uses colors or labels to indicate process status:

*   **On-time**: Running normally, no deadlines missed.
*   **Due soon**: One or more tasks are due very soon (e.g., within 24 hours).
*   **Overdue / Problem**: A task deadline is missed, or someone reported a blocker.
