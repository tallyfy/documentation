## View the activity log for a process

Every running Tallyfy [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) has an activity log showing what happened and who did it. Use it to track progress or troubleshoot issues.

The log records actions like:
*   Task completions or re-opens
*   Deadline changes
*   Comments added
*   Process archiving/unarchiving
*   Assignment and ownership updates

### How do I view the process activity log?

1.  Open the running process (e.g., from the **Tracker** view).
2.  Click the **Settings** button (gear icon) in the top right corner.
3.  Click the **Activity** tab in the panel that opens.
4.  The most recent events appear at the top.

:::note[Activity timestamp display]
Tallyfy stores activity timestamps in ISO 8601 format. The interface converts them to your personal timezone setting, so you'll always see accurate local times.
:::

:::note[Permissions]
**Administrators**, the process creator, task assignees, and [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) with read permission on the process can see its activity log.
