## View the activity log for a process

Each running Tallyfy [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) keeps a detailed log of everything that happens within it. This Activity log helps you track progress, see who did what, and troubleshoot problems.

It records actions like:
*   Task completions or re-opens.
*   Deadline changes.
*   Comments added.
*   Process archiving/unarchiving.
*   And more.

### How do I view the process activity log?

1.  Open the running process you want to view (e.g., from the **Tracker** view).
2.  Click the **Settings** button (gear icon ⚙️) in the top right corner of the process view.
3.  In the panel that opens, click the **Activity** tab.
4.  Scroll through the log to see the action history; the most recent events are at the top.

:::note[Activity timestamp display]
Process activity timestamps are stored on our server in ISO 8601 format without timezone information. In the Tallyfy interface, these timestamps are automatically converted to display in your personal timezone setting, ensuring you see accurate local times while maintaining consistent data storage.

:::note[Permissions]
Only **Administrators** and [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) with permission to view the process can see its Activity Log.
