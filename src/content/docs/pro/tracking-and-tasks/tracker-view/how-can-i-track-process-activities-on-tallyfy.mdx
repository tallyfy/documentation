## Viewing the activity log for a process

Each running [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) in Tallyfy keeps a detailed log of everything that happens within it. This Activity log helps you track progress, see who did what, and troubleshoot problems.

It records actions like:
*   Task completions or re-opens.
*   Deadline changes.
*   Comments added.
*   Process archiving/unarchiving.
*   And more.

### How to view the process activity log

1.  Open the running process you want to view (e.g., from the **Tracker** view).
2.  Click the **Settings** button (gear icon ⚙️) in the top right corner of the process view.
3.  In the panel that opens, click the **Activity** tab.
4.  Scroll through the log to see the action history; the most recent events are at the top.

Only **Administrators** and [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) with permission to view the process can see its Activity Log.
