## What is the Tracker view in Tallyfy?

The **Tracker** view provides a real-time dashboard of all running processes in your organization. You can monitor progress, spot bottlenecks, and ensure nothing gets overlooked - all from one centralized location.

Unlike individual task management, the Tracker shows you the big picture. You see how processes connect, where work is flowing smoothly, and where attention is needed. This bird's-eye view helps you manage workloads and prevent issues before they become problems.

## Key features of the Tracker view

### Flexible display options

Tallyfy offers two ways to visualize your processes:

*   **Board View**: Visual cards show each process with status indicators, assignees, and progress bars. Perfect for teams who prefer kanban-style organization.
*   **Table View**: A spreadsheet-like format displays processes in rows with customizable columns. Ideal for sorting, filtering, and bulk operations.

Switch between views instantly based on your current needs. See [how to switch between board and table formats](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/how-to-switch-between-board-and-table-formats-in-tallyfy-tracker/) for step-by-step instructions.

### Smart filtering capabilities

Focus on what matters most with powerful filters:
- View only overdue processes
- Show processes assigned to specific team members
- Filter by template type or department
- Display processes with active issues or blockers

Save your favorite filter combinations for quick access later.
