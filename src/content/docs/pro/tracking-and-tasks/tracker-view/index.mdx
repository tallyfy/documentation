## What is the Tracker view in Tallyfy?

The **Tracker** view gives you a comprehensive look at all your running processes, enabling you to track every element as part of a larger workflow. Think of it as your central command center that ensures every step is considered and nothing is missed.

The Tracker helps you monitor multiple workflows simultaneously, tracking each process as part of your larger organizational workflow. This comprehensive visibility ensures nothing falls through the cracks and helps prevent problems later by keeping tabs on how all your workflows connect and progress together.

You can customize the Tracker view using **Filters** to focus on specific aspects of your larger workflow (like processes with issues, client-facing tasks, or workflows for specific departments).

You can also switch how workflow information is displayed:

*   **Board View**: Shows workflow processes as visual cards to track progress across your larger workflow
*   **Table View**: Shows processes in a list format where you can customize columns to track specific data points as part of your larger workflow

See [Switch Between Views](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/how-to-switch-between-board-and-table-formats-in-tallyfy-tracker/) for more details.

:::note[What future view options are planned?]
We are considering adding other ways to view and track processes as part of larger workflows, such as Calendar, Gantt, or Timeline views. Let our Tallyfy support team know if these would be helpful for tracking your integrated workflows. Your feedback helps prioritize feature development.
