## The Tracker view

The **Tracker** view is your real-time dashboard for all running processes. Monitor progress, spot bottlenecks, and catch problems early - all from one screen.

Unlike the Tasks view (your personal to-do list), the Tracker shows the big picture across your whole organization. You see where work flows smoothly and where it doesn't.

## Key features

### Display options

Tallyfy gives you two ways to view your processes:

*   **Board View** - Visual cards showing each process with status indicators, assignees, and progress bars. Good for kanban-style tracking.
*   **Table View** - A spreadsheet-like format with sortable columns. Better for sorting, filtering, and working with many processes at once.

Switch between views anytime. See [how to switch between board and table formats](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/how-to-switch-between-board-and-table-formats-in-tallyfy-tracker/) for details.

### Filtering

The Tracker comes with built-in filter presets:
- **All processes** - everything in your organization
- **My processes** - processes where you're involved
- **Overdue processes** - anything past its deadline
- **Favorites** - processes you've starred
- **Overdue problems** - processes with unresolved issues
- **Untagged** - processes without tags
- **Archived** - completed or shelved processes

You can also filter by assigned members, tags, template type, and folder. Save custom filter combinations as presets for quick access.

### Process management actions

From the Tracker, you can:
- Archive processes to remove them from active views
- Organize processes into folders
- Star processes as favorites for quick access
- Export process data to CSV
- View all form field responses using the **Preview** option inside a process

:::tip[Viewing all form data in one place]
Open any process from the Tracker and switch to the **Preview** option. This shows all form field responses collected throughout the process in a single summary - no need to click through each task individually.
:::

:::note[Table view export requirements]
**You must select a specific template** before the export option becomes available in table view.

**Why?** Different templates have different field structures, so CSV exports need consistent columns. Cross-template data would create incompatible headers.

**For multi-template exports**:
1. Export each template separately, then combine in a spreadsheet
2. Use [Tallyfy Analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/) for cross-template reporting
:::

### Custom view display logic

**Why you see completed processes**: Custom views show processes where you're **involved**, not just where you have outstanding tasks.

You're "involved" if:
- You were assigned to any task (even completed ones)
- You were mentioned in comments
- You participated in approval steps
- You're the process owner

**To focus on current work**:
- Use the **My processes** preset to see only processes you're involved in
- Apply a status filter for "Active" to hide completed processes
- Archive finished processes to remove them from active views

### Sorting options

**Board view sorting** (from the sort dropdown):
- Newest first / oldest first (by created date)
- Most delayed
- Name A-Z / Name Z-A

**Table view sorting** - click any column header to sort by: name, progress, status, due date, started by, process owner, favorites, start date, last updated, assignees, next step, and more.

**Not available yet** - sorting by custom form field data (kick-off form dates, dropdown selections, number fields). Workarounds:
1. Include sort-relevant data in process names (e.g., "2025-08-12 - Client Onboarding")
2. Export to CSV and sort in spreadsheet software
3. Use filters instead of sorting
4. Save different filtered presets for different needs

:::note[Future enhancements]
Calendar, Gantt chart, and Timeline views are being explored, along with form field sorting. Share your preferences with Tallyfy support.
