## What is the Tracker view in Tallyfy?

The **Tracker** view provides a "big picture" look at all your running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). This centralized dashboard enables comprehensive workflow oversight and management.

The Tracker helps you quickly see the status and progress of multiple workflows at once. This unified visibility ensures nothing falls through the cracks while maintaining awareness of overall organizational workflow health.

You can customize the Tracker view using **Filters** to show only certain processes (e.g., only those with issues, or only those for a specific client).

You can also switch how workflow information is displayed:

*   **Board View**: Shows workflow processes as visual cards
*   **Table View**: Shows processes in a list format where you can customize the columns

See [Switch Between Views](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/how-to-switch-between-board-and-table-formats-in-tallyfy-tracker/) for more details.

:::note[What future view options are planned?]
We are considering adding other ways to view processes in the future, such as Calendar, Gantt, or Timeline views. Let our Tallyfy support team know if these would be helpful for your workflow management. Your feedback helps prioritize feature development.
