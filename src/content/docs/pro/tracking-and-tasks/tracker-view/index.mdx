## Tracker - a high-level view of process status

The Tracker provides a visual way to see and filters processes at a high level. You can see the status of any process via this view.

You can customize and filter what shows up in this view by using the _Filters_ available at the top of the view.

Beyond changing the data that appears using filters - you can also view processes in two different form factors:

* A **Board** view - which shows you "cards" for every process
* A **Table** view - which shows you processes in tabular format, where you can customize which columns show and hide.
