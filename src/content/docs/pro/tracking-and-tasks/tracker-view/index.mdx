## Tracker view - A high-level overview of process status

The **Tracker** view provides a "big picture" look at all your running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). It helps you quickly see the status and progress of multiple workflows.

You can customize this view using **Filters** to show only certain processes (e.g., only those with issues, or only those for a specific client).

You can also switch how the information is displayed:

*   **Board View**: Shows processes as visual cards.
*   **Table View**: Shows processes in a list format where you can customize the columns.

See [Switch Between Views](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/how-to-switch-between-board-and-table-formats-in-tallyfy-tracker/) for more details.

:::note[Future view options]
We are considering adding other ways to view processes in the future, such as Calendar, Gantt, or Timeline views. Let our support team know if these would be helpful for you.
