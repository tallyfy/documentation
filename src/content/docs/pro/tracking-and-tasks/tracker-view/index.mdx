## The Tracker view

The **Tracker** view provides a real-time dashboard of all running processes in your organization. You can monitor progress, spot bottlenecks, and ensure nothing gets overlooked - all from one centralized location.

Unlike individual task management, the Tracker shows you the big picture. You see how processes connect, where work is flowing smoothly, and where attention is needed. This bird's-eye view helps you manage workloads and prevent issues before they become problems.

## Key features of the Tracker view

### Flexible display options

Tallyfy offers two ways to visualize your processes:

*   **Board View**: Visual cards show each process with status indicators, assignees, and progress bars. Perfect for teams who prefer kanban-style organization.
*   **Table View**: A spreadsheet-like format displays processes in rows with customizable columns. Ideal for sorting, filtering, and bulk operations.

Switch between views instantly based on your current needs. See [how to switch between board and table formats](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/how-to-switch-between-board-and-table-formats-in-tallyfy-tracker/) for step-by-step instructions.

### Smart filtering capabilities

Focus on what matters most with powerful filters:
- View only overdue processes
- Show processes assigned to specific team members
- Filter by template type or department
- Display processes with active issues or blockers
- Access archived processes for reference or restoration

Save your favorite filter combinations for quick access later.

### Process management actions

From the Tracker view, you can perform various actions on processes:
- Archive processes to remove them from active views
- Organize processes into folders
- Add processes to favorites for quick access
- Export process data to CSV
- View aggregated form responses across all tasks

These management features help maintain a clean, organized workspace while preserving important historical data.

:::tip[Viewing all form data in one place]
**Need to see all form responses without clicking through tasks?** Open any process from the Tracker view and change the view to the **Preview** option. This shows all form field responses collected throughout the process in a summary format. Perfect for project managers who need quick overviews without navigating task-by-task.
:::

:::note[Table view export requirements]
**Blueprint selection is mandatory** for exporting from table view. You must select a specific template/blueprint before the export option becomes available.

**Why this requirement exists**:
- Different templates have different field structures and data types
- CSV exports need consistent column formatting across all rows
- Cross-template data would create incompatible column headers

**Workarounds for multi-template exports**:
1. Export each template separately, then combine in spreadsheet software
2. Use dashboard views for cross-template summaries
3. Consider using [Tallyfy Analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/) for full reporting across multiple templates

**Best practice**: Filter to your desired template first, apply any additional filters, then export. Use descriptive file names to track which template each export contains.

### Understanding custom view display logic

**Why completed processes still appear**: Custom views show processes where you're **involved**, not just where you have **outstanding tasks**.

You're considered "involved" in a process if:
- You were assigned to any task (even if completed)
- You were mentioned or tagged in comments
- You participated in approval or review steps
- You're listed as the process owner

**Managing your view for clarity**:
- **"My Tasks" view**: Shows only processes with your pending tasks
- **Custom views**: Shows all processes where you're involved (including completed work)
- **Use status filters**: Filter by "Active" to hide completed processes
- **Archive completed work**: Remove finished processes from active views

This design helps you track overall involvement and maintain historical visibility while allowing filtering for current work only.

### Current sorting limitations

**Available sorting options**:
- Process name (alphabetical)
- Status (active, complete, archived)
- Created date
- Last modified date
- Due date (based on template deadlines)

**Not yet available - Form field sorting**:
You cannot currently sort by custom form field data such as:
- Date fields from kick-off forms (e.g., "move-in date", "project deadline")
- Dropdown selections (e.g., priority levels, categories)
- Number fields (e.g., contract value, quantity)
- Custom text fields

**Workarounds for custom sorting needs**:
1. **Include sort data in process names** - Add dates or priorities to the process name (e.g., "2025-08-12 - Client Onboarding - High Priority")
2. **Export and sort externally** - Export to CSV for custom sorting in spreadsheet software
3. **Use filters instead** - Filter by specific form field values rather than sorting
4. **Create multiple presets** - Save different filtered views for different sorting needs

Form field sorting is planned for future development. Contact support to vote for this feature priority.

:::note[Future enhancements]
We're exploring additional view options including Calendar, Gantt charts, Timeline views, and enhanced sorting by form fields. Share your preferences with our support team - your feedback directly influences our development roadmap.
