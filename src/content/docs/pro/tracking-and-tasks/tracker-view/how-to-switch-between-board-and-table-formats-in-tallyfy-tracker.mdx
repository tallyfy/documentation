## How can I switch between board and table formats in Tallyfy Tracker?

The **[Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** provides two distinct display formats optimized for different workflow management preferences and use cases.

These complementary view formats accommodate diverse working styles and information needs:

*   **Board View** (Default): Displays processes as visual cards with optional grouping capabilities (e.g., organized by status, priority, or assignee)
*   **Table View**: Presents processes in structured tabular format with customizable column configurations for detailed data analysis

### How do I switch between views?

1.  Go to the **Tracker** view from the left sidebar.
2.  Find the buttons or tabs (usually near the top right) labeled **Board** and **Table**.
3.  Click the view format you prefer.

### How can I customize the table view?

When using the **Table View**:

*   Processes are listed as rows.
*   You can choose which columns (process details) to show.
*   Click the column settings icon (often a gear or columns icon, usually top right of the table).
*   Check/uncheck the columns you want to show or hide (e.g., Name, Progress, Status, Due Date, Owner, Start Date, Last Updated).

This lets you adjust the Table view to show the most relevant information for your tracking needs. Customization ensures optimal workflow visibility based on your specific monitoring requirements.

## Table view navigation best practices

**Known behavior**: Table view may reset to the default (first) blueprint in your dropdown list when navigating back to the tracker.

**Common triggers that cause blueprint reset**:
- Using the browser back button instead of in-app navigation
- Navigating from external links back to tracker view
- Session timeouts or forced page refreshes
- Following bookmarks that don't include blueprint parameters

**Best practices to maintain your selected blueprint**:
1. **Use in-app navigation** - Click the tracker menu item instead of browser back button
2. **Create specific bookmarks** - Bookmark the URL after selecting your blueprint (includes the selection in the URL)
3. **Avoid browser controls** - Use Tallyfy's navigation menu rather than browser forward/back buttons
4. **Expect reselection after refresh** - Page refreshes will return to default blueprint

**Quick recovery**: When the view resets, simply reselect your desired blueprint from the dropdown. All your data remains intact - it's just the view selection that resets. Consider this a minor inconvenience rather than a data issue.
