## Switching Between Board and Table Views in Tracker

The **[Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** view, where you see your running processes, can be displayed in two formats:

*   **Board View** (Default): Shows processes as cards, often grouped visually (e.g., by status or template).
*   **Table View**: Shows processes as rows in a table, allowing you to customize columns.

### How to Switch Views

1.  Go to the **Tracker** view from the left sidebar.
2.  Look for buttons or tabs (usually near the top right) labeled **Board** and **Table**.
3.  Click the format you want to use.

### Customizing the Table View

When using the **Table View**:

*   Processes are listed in rows.
*   You can customize which columns (details about the process) are displayed.
*   Click the column settings button (often a gear icon or dropdown in the top right corner of the table).
*   Check or uncheck the boxes for the columns you want to see or hide (e.g., Name, Progress, Status, Due Date, Owner, Start Date, Last Updated, etc.).

This lets you tailor the Table view to show the most relevant information for how you track processes.
