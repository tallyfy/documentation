## How to switch between board and table formats in the tracker view

In this article, we'll show you how to view your Tracker (process dashboard) in two different formats: Board and Table. It's super easy, just keep reading! ðŸ˜‰

## Switch format

To switch between these two formats, follow these steps:

1. Go to your Tracker view, which you can find in the sidebar. By default, it will be in the Board view.

2. Choose either Table or Board to switch the format.

The Table view organizes the templates into categories, and each active process has its row. To see processes for a specific template, simply select the desired template from the dropdown list.

- Name
- Progress
- Status
- Due
- Started By
- Process Owner
- Starred
- Start Date
- Last Updated
- Assigned
- Next Step
- Next Step Assignee
