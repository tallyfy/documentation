## Switch between board and table formats

The **[Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** has two view formats you can switch between at any time:

*   **Board view** (default) - Shows processes as visual cards you can group and scan quickly
*   **Table view** - Lists processes as rows with sortable, filterable columns for detailed tracking

:::note
Table view is only available for organization members. Guest users can only see the Board view.
:::

### How do I switch between views?

1.  Open the **Tracker** from the left sidebar.
2.  Find the **View** dropdown near the top of the page.
3.  Select **Board** or **Table**.

### How can I customize the table view?

Table view requires you to pick a template (blueprint) first. Once selected, you'll see processes listed as rows with columns like Name, Progress, Status, Due, Started By, Process Owner, Start Date, Last Updated, Assigned, Next Step, and more.

You can show or hide columns to focus on what matters most.

## Table view navigation tips

**Known behavior** - Table view resets to the first blueprint in your dropdown when you navigate away and come back. This happens because the selected blueprint isn't always preserved in the URL.

**Common triggers**:
- Using the browser back button instead of Tallyfy's sidebar navigation
- Navigating from external links back to the tracker
- Page refreshes or session timeouts
- Bookmarks that don't include the blueprint parameter

**How to work around it**:
1. **Use in-app navigation** - Click the Tracker menu item instead of browser back
2. **Bookmark after selecting** - The URL includes your blueprint selection once chosen
3. **Expect reselection after refresh** - Just pick your blueprint again from the dropdown. Your data isn't affected - only the view selection resets.
