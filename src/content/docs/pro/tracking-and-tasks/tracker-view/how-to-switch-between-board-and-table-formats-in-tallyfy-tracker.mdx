## Switching between board and table views in Tracker

The **[Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** view, where you see running processes, has two display formats:

*   **Board View** (Default): Shows processes as cards, often grouped (e.g., by status).
*   **Table View**: Shows processes in a table format, letting you customize columns.

### How to switch views

1.  Go to the **Tracker** view from the left sidebar.
2.  Find the buttons or tabs (usually near the top right) labeled **Board** and **Table**.
3.  Click the view format you prefer.

### Customizing the table view

When using the **Table View**:

*   Processes are listed as rows.
*   You can choose which columns (process details) to show.
*   Click the column settings icon (often a gear or columns icon, usually top right of the table).
*   Check/uncheck the columns you want to show or hide (e.g., Name, Progress, Status, Due Date, Owner, Start Date, Last Updated).

This lets you adjust the Table view to show the most relevant information for your tracking needs.
