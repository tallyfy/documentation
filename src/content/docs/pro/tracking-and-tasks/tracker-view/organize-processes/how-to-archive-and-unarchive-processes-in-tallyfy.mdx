## How can I archive and unarchive processes in Tracker?

This article explains how to archive and unarchive [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) in Tallyfy. Archiving removes a process from active views without permanently deleting it. This feature provides workflow organization while preserving data for future reference.

:::note[How can I pause or stop processes?]
Tallyfy does not currently have a feature to "pause" or "stop" a running process temporarily. If a process is started incorrectly, is no longer needed, or was just for testing, **archiving** is the recommended way to remove it from your active Tracker view. You can [delete archived processes permanently](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/edit-processes/how-can-i-delete-a-process-in-tallyfy/) later if needed.
:::

:::note[What are the role limitations for archiving?]
[Members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) in the **Light** role cannot archive or unarchive processes. This restriction ensures proper process management control.
