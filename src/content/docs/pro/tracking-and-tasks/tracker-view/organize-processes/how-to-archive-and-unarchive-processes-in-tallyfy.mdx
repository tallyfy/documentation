## How to archive and unarchive processes in Tracker

This article explains how to archive and unarchive [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) in Tallyfy. Archiving removes a process from active views without permanently deleting it.

:::note[Pausing or stopping processes]
Tallyfy does not currently have a feature to "pause" or "stop" a running process temporarily. If a process is started incorrectly, is no longer needed, or was just for testing, **archiving** is the recommended way to remove it from your active Tracker view. You can [delete archived processes permanently](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/edit-processes/how-can-i-delete-a-process-in-tallyfy/) later if needed.

:::note[Light role limitation]
[Members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) in the **Light** role cannot archive or unarchive processes.
