## How can I archive and unarchive processes in Tracker?

This article explains how to archive and unarchive [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) in Tallyfy. Archiving removes a process from active views without permanently deleting it. This feature provides workflow organization while preserving data for future reference.

:::note[How can I pause or stop processes?]
Tallyfy does not currently have a feature to "pause" or "stop" a running process temporarily. If a process is started incorrectly, is no longer needed, or was just for testing, **archiving** is the recommended way to remove it from your active Tracker view. You can [delete archived processes permanently](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/edit-processes/how-can-i-delete-a-process-in-tallyfy/) later if needed.

:::note[Role permissions for archiving]
**Who can archive/unarchive processes:**
- **Administrator users**: ✅ Full archive/unarchive permissions
- **Standard users**: ✅ Full archive/unarchive permissions
- **Light users**: ❌ Cannot archive or unarchive processes

**Important for Light users**: The archive button will appear in the interface, but clicking it will not actually archive the process. This is an intentional permission restriction to ensure proper process management control.

**Workaround for Light users**: If your organization has many Light users who complete processes that need archiving, enable auto-archive:
1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Customization**
2. Enable auto-archive for completed processes
3. Processes will automatically archive when all tasks are completed

This eliminates the need for manual archiving by Light users while keeping your Tracker view clean.
