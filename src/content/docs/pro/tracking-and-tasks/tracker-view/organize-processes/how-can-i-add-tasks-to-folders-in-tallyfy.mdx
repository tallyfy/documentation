## How can I organize active processes into folders?

This article explains organizing active [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) into folders üìÅ in the **[Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** view. Folders help sort and group processes for better tracking (e.g., by client, project, status). This organization approach enhances workflow visibility and project management efficiency.

:::note[Why are process folders separate from template folders?]
Tallyfy uses separate folder systems for [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) and for active processes. This separation lets you organize:
- Templates by type or department (e.g., "HR Templates", "Client Ops Templates").
- Active processes by client, project, or status (e.g., "Coca Cola Work Requests", "Urgent Projects").

This means an "Employee Onboarding" template might be in an "HR" template folder, but running onboarding processes could be in process folders like "Sales Onboardings" or "IT Onboardings". This dual structure provides optimal organization for different workflow phases.

### How do I create or add processes to folders?

<Steps>

2. Click the three dots (...) menu on the process card you want to organize.

5. A window appears. Choose an existing folder or click **Create Folder** to make a new one.

Once a process is in a folder, you can filter the **Tracker** view to show only processes in that folder:

<Steps>
1. Click **Add Filter** at the top of the **Tracker** view.
2. Choose the **Folder** filter.
3. Select the folder name.
