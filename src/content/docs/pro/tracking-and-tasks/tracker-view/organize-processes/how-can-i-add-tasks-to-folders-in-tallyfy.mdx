## How to add active processes to folders

This article explains how to organize your [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) into folders. üìÅ
Folders help you sort and group your processes, making them easier to find.

:::note[Process folders vs. Template folders]
Tallyfy uses separate folder systems for [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) and for active processes. This gives you the flexibility to organize:
- Templates by function, department, or process type
- Active processes by client, project, department, or any other execution-focused category

**For example:** 
- You might store an "Employee Onboarding" template in an "HR" templates folder.
- But when running onboarding processes, you'd organize them in folders like "Sales Onboardings" or "IT Onboardings" based on the department being onboarded.

Similarly, client work request templates might live in a "Client Ops" folder, while actual client processes are organized in folders like "Coca Cola Work Requests" to group all work for specific clients.

## Create and add processes to folders

In order to create a folder, follow these steps:

- Head over to the tracker view, in it, Click on the triple dots located at the top right of the process you want to add to a folder, then select "Add to Folder".

- A window will appear, allowing you to choose the desired folder for the process, or you can create a new folder.

Once you add your process to a folder, you can easily filter processes using the "Add filter" option at the top of the tracker view, then select the desired folder you want to filter on.
