## Organizing active processes into folders

This article explains organizing active [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) into folders üìÅ in the **[Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** view. Folders help sort and group processes for better tracking (e.g., by client, project, status).

:::note[Process folders vs. template folders]
Tallyfy uses separate folder systems for [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) and for active processes. This lets you organize:
- Templates by type or department (e.g., "HR Templates", "Client Ops Templates").
- Active processes by client, project, or status (e.g., "Coca Cola Work Requests", "Urgent Projects").

This means an "Employee Onboarding" template might be in an "HR" template folder, but running onboarding processes could be in process folders like "Sales Onboardings" or "IT Onboardings".
