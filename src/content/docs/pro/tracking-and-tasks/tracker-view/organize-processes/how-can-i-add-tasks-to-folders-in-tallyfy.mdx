## Organize processes into folders

Today, we're going to talk about organizing your tasks into folders. üìÅ
Sometimes it can be challenging to keep track of all your tasks. With folders, you can easily sort and group your processes, making them super easy to find.

## Create and add processes to folders

In order to create a folder, follow these steps:

- Head over to the tracker view, in it, Click on the triple dots located at the top right of the process you want to add to a folder, then select "Add to Folder".

- A window will appear, allowing you to choose the desired folder for the process, or you can create a new folder.

Once you add your process to a folder, you can easily filter processes using the "Add filter" option at the top of the tracker view, then select the desired folder you want to filter on.
