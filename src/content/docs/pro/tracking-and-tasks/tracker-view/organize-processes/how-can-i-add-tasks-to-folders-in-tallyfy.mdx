## Organize active processes into folders

This article explains organizing active [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) into folders 📁 in the **[Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** view. Folders help sort and group processes for better tracking (e.g., by client, project, status). This organization approach enhances workflow visibility and project management efficiency.

:::note[Why are process folders separate from template folders?]
Tallyfy uses separate folder systems for [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) and for active processes. This separation lets you organize:
- Templates by type or department (e.g., "HR Templates", "Client Ops Templates").
- Active processes by client, project, or status (e.g., "Coca Cola Work Requests", "Urgent Projects").

This means an "Employee Onboarding" template might be in an "HR" template folder, but running onboarding processes could be in process folders like "Sales Onboardings" or "IT Onboardings". This dual structure provides optimal organization for different workflow phases.

3. Select the folder name.
