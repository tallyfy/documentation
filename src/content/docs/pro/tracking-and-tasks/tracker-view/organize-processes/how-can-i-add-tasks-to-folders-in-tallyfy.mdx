## Organize active processes into folders

You can group active [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) into folders in the **[Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** view - by client, project, status, or whatever makes sense for your team.

:::note[Why are process folders separate from template folders?]
Tallyfy keeps separate folder systems for [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) and active processes. This lets you organize:
- Templates by type or department (e.g., "HR Templates", "Client Ops Templates").
- Active processes by client, project, or status (e.g., "Coca Cola Work Requests", "Urgent Projects").

An "Employee Onboarding" template might live in an "HR" template folder, while running onboarding processes go into folders like "Sales Onboardings" or "IT Onboardings".
