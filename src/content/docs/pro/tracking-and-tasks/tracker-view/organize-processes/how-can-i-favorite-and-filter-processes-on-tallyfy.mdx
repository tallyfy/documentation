## Favorites - bookmarking and watching

Click the star icon in the left sidebar to open Favorites. It lets you bookmark items (processes, tasks, members, templates) for quick access. Starring an item also "watches" it - you'll get notifications when specific events happen to that item.

### What does "watching" mean?

When you watch an item by starring it, Tallyfy notifies you about specific events. The events that trigger notifications depend on the item type.

### What events trigger notifications?

#### Templates (procedure and document)
When you watch a template, you'll be notified about:
- **Step creation** - New steps added to the template
- **Step deletion** - Steps removed from the template
- **Assignee changes** - Step assignees added or removed
- **Form field creation** - New form fields added to steps
- **Form field deletion** - Form fields removed from steps

Document templates also trigger notifications when their content is updated.

#### Tasks (including one-off tasks)
When you watch a task, you'll be notified about:
- **Task completion** - The task is marked complete
- **Assignee changes** - Task assignees are added or changed
- **Deadline changes** - The task deadline is modified
- **Task reopening** - The task is reopened after completion

Comments, file attachments, and form field value changes don't trigger watcher notifications.

#### Processes
When you watch a process, you'll be notified about:
- **Task completion** - Any task within the process is completed
- **Process completion** - The entire process finishes
- **Archiving/restoring** - The process is archived or restored
- **Owner changes** - The process owner is changed

#### Members
When you watch a team member, you'll be notified when that person:
- **Launches a process** - Creates a new process instance
- **Completes a task** - Finishes any assigned task

### How do I access Favorites?

Click the star again to unfavorite and unwatch the item.

### How do I filter Favorites?

Use the filter options at the top of the Favorites section to show only certain item types - for example, only favorited processes or only favorited tasks.

### How can I set notification preferences?

For each favorited item, you can control how and how often you're notified.

*   **Target options** - Choose *how* you want notifications:
    *   **Email** - Receive notifications via email
    *   **Webhook** - Send notifications to external systems via webhook URLs
    ![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-target-options-favorite.png)

*   **Notification frequency** - Choose *when* notifications arrive:
    *   **Electric** - Immediate notification when an event happens
    *   **Mindful** - Digest sent every 3 hours
    *   **Chilled** - Daily digest sent once per day
    ![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-frequency-options-favorite.png)

You can mix frequencies across items. Get instant alerts for critical items and daily digests for less urgent ones. The events that trigger notifications stay the same - only the delivery timing changes.

### How do I manage watched items?

The Favorites section is your hub for managing watched items:
*   View all favorited/watched items
*   Change notification settings (frequency and target) per item
*   Filter the list by item type
*   Unfavorite items by clicking the star again
