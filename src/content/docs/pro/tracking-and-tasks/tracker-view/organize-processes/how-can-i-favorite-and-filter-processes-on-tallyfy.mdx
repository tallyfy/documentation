## Your favorites section

Sometimes you want to "subscribe" to a particular process, task, member or even a template's progress so that you get notified when something changes in any of these. This is where the "Favorites" section comes in handy. You can mark any process, task, member or template as a favorite and then easily access them from the "Favorites" section.

## The favorites section

To access the "Favorites" section, click on the star icon in the left sidebar. This will open the "Favorites" section where you can see all the processes, tasks, members, and templates that you have marked as favorites.

You will then be presented with a list of all the processes, tasks, members, and templates that you have marked as favorites. You can click on any of these to view more details or to access them directly.

## Add processes to your favorites

To start marking processes as favorite. Just hover over an active process and look for the star in the bottom right corner. Click on it and voila! You've just favorited that process. It's like having your own personal star!

## Add tasks to your Favorites

To mark a task as a favorite, select the task of your choice either from the [tasks view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/) or directly from the [process itself](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) and simply click on the star icon next to the task name. This will add the task to your favorites list.

Click on the member that you want to mark as a favorite, and then click on the star icon next to their name. This will add the member to your favorites list.

## Filter processes

You can filter processes either by clicking the search bar and looking for something specific, or you can check and uncheck the boxes at the top to specify what you want to see. You can filter by processes, tasks, members, and templates.

## Target options

Target options are a way of specifying in which way you want to be notified on. Right now, **We are still working on the webhook and chat notification options**. But you can still use the email notification option. Which will send you an email whenever a process, task, member, or template that you have marked as a favorite is updated.

## Frequency options

Frequency options are a way of specifying how often you want to be notified. You can choose from the following options:

- **Electric**: This will notify you immediately when the selected favorite is updated.
- **Mindful**: This will notify you every few hours when the selected favorite is updated.
- **Chilled**: This will notify you once a day when the selected favorite is updated.
