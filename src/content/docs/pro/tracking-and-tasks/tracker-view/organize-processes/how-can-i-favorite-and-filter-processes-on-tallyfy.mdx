## Using the Favorites Section (Bookmarking & Watching)

The Favorites feature (click the star icon ⭐ in the left sidebar) lets you bookmark important items (processes, tasks, members, templates) for quick access. Adding an item to Favorites also automatically makes you "watch" it, meaning you can get notifications about changes.

### What does "Watching" mean?

When you "watch" an item (by adding it to your Favorites), Tallyfy can notify you when something changes (like a task being completed or a template being updated). You control *how often* you get these notifications.

### Accessing your Favorites

Click the star icon ⭐ in the left sidebar to open your Favorites section. This shows everything you've marked as a favorite.

### How to Favorite Items

*   **Processes**: Hover over a process card in the Tracker view and click the star icon ⭐ that appears.

*   **Tasks**: Open the task (from the Tasks view or within a process) and click the star icon ⭐ next to the task name.

*   **Members** (Admins Only): Go to **Settings > Organization > Members**, click a member's name, and click the star icon ⭐.

*   **Templates**: Go to the **Templates** library, hover over a template card, and click the star icon ⭐.

Clicking the star again unfavorites (and stops watching) the item.

### Filtering Your Favorites

Within the Favorites section, you can use the filter options at the top to show only specific types of items (e.g., only show favorite processes or only favorite tasks).

### Setting Notification Preferences for Watched Items

For each item in your Favorites list, you can control *how* and *how often* you get notified about changes.

*   **Target Options**: Choose *how* you want to be notified (currently, email notifications are the main option).

*   **Notification Frequency**: Choose *how often* you get notified about changes to that specific item:
    *   **Electric**: Get notified instantly, in real-time.
    *   **Mindful**: Get updates grouped together every few hours.
    *   **Chilled**: Get one daily summary email of all changes.

You can set different frequencies for different items, allowing you to get instant alerts for critical things and daily summaries for less urgent ones.

### Managing Your Watched Items

The Favorites section is where you manage everything you are watching:
*   See your full list of favorited/watched items.
*   Change notification frequency or target for any item.
*   Filter the list.
*   Remove items by clicking the star again to unfavorite them.
