## Using the Favorites section (bookmarking & watching)

The Favorites feature (click the star icon ⭐ in the left sidebar) lets you bookmark items (processes, tasks, members, templates) for quick access. Adding an item to Favorites also automatically "watches" it, meaning you can get notifications about its changes.

### What does "watching" mean?

When you "watch" an item (by adding it to Favorites), Tallyfy can notify you when something changes (like task completion or template updates). You control how often you get notifications.

### Accessing your Favorites

Click the star icon ⭐ in the left sidebar to open Favorites. This shows all items you've marked.

### How to favorite items

*   **Processes**: Hover over a process in the Tracker view and click the star icon ⭐.

*   **Tasks**: Open the task and click the star icon ⭐ next to the task name.

*   **Members** (Admins Only): Go to **Settings > Organization > Members**, click a member's name, then click the star icon ⭐.

*   **Templates**: Go to the **Templates** library, hover over a template, and click the star icon ⭐.

Clicking the star again unfavorites (and unwatches) the item.

### Filtering your Favorites

Within the Favorites section, use the filter options at the top to show only certain item types (e.g., only show favorited processes or favorited tasks).

### Setting notification preferences for watched items

For each item in your Favorites list, you can control how and how often you're notified about changes.

*   **Target Options**: Choose *how* you want to be notified (currently, email is the main option).

*   **Notification Frequency**: Choose how often you're notified about changes to that specific item:
    *   **Electric**: Get notified instantly.
    *   **Mindful**: Get grouped updates every few hours.
    *   **Chilled**: Get a daily summary email.

You can set different frequencies for different items, letting you get instant alerts for critical items and daily summaries for less urgent ones.

### Managing your watched items

The Favorites section is where you manage watched items:
*   View your full list of favorited/watched items.
*   Change notification settings (frequency/target) for any item.
*   Filter your list.
*   Remove items by clicking the star again (unfavorites/unwatches).
