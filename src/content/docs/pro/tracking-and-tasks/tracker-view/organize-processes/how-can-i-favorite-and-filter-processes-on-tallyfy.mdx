## Your favorites section

The Favorites feature in Tallyfy combines two powerful capabilities: bookmarking items you care about and setting up notifications for changes to those items. When you favorite an object (process, task, member, or template), two things happen:

1. The item appears in your "Favorites" section in the left menu for easy access
2. You automatically begin "watching" the item, which means you'll receive notifications when it changes

This watching capability allows you to stay informed about important changes without constantly checking the system. You can control both what you're watching and how frequently you receive notifications.

## The favorites section

To access the "Favorites" section, click on the star icon in the left sidebar. This will open the "Favorites" section where you can see all the processes, tasks, members, and templates that you have marked as favorites.

You will then be presented with a list of all the processes, tasks, members, and templates that you have marked as favorites. You can click on any of these to view more details or to access them directly.

## Add processes to your favorites

To start marking processes as favorite. Just hover over an active process and look for the star in the bottom right corner. Click on it and voila! You've just favorited that process. It's like having your own personal star!

## Add tasks to your Favorites

To mark a task as a favorite, select the task of your choice either from the [tasks view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/) or directly from the [process itself](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) and simply click on the star icon next to the task name. This will add the task to your favorites list.

## Add members to your Favorites

To mark a member as a favorite, click on the "People" tab in the left sidebar. This will open the "Members" section where you can see all the members in your organization. Click on the member that you want to mark as a favorite, and then click on the star icon next to their name. This will add the member to your favorites list.

Note that you will only be able to mark members as favorites if you are an admin from the organization.

## Add templates to your Favorites

To mark a template as a favorite, click on the "Templates" tab in the left sidebar. This will open the "Templates" section where you can see all the templates in your organization. Click on the template that you want to mark as a favorite, and then click on the star icon next to the template name. This will add the template to your favorites list.

## Filter processes

You can filter processes either by clicking the search bar and looking for something specific, or you can check and uncheck the boxes at the top to specify what you want to see. You can filter by processes, tasks, members, and templates.

## Target options

Target options are a way of specifying how you want to be notified. Right now, **We are still working on the webhook and chat notification options**. But you can still use the email notification option, which will send you an email whenever a process, task, member, or template that you have marked as a favorite is updated.

## Notification frequency options

When you favorite an item, you control how often you're notified about changes. Tallyfy offers three frequency settings:

- **Electric**: Receive immediate, real-time notifications whenever the item changes
- **Mindful**: Receive grouped notifications every few hours, combining multiple changes into digestible updates
- **Chilled**: Receive a daily summary of all changes, perfect for less urgent monitoring

You can adjust these settings for each favorited item separately, allowing you to prioritize notifications based on importance.

## Managing your watched items

The Favorites section serves as your control center for all watched items. Here you can:

- See all items you're currently watching
- Adjust notification frequency for each item
- Change notification targets
- Filter to find specific items 
- Remove items from your favorites/watched list

This gives you complete control over what you monitor and how you're notified about changes.
