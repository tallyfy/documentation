## How can I use the Favorites section for bookmarking and watching?

The Favorites feature (click the star icon ⭐ in the left sidebar) lets you bookmark items (processes, tasks, members, templates) for quick access. Adding an item to Favorites also automatically "watches" it, meaning you'll receive notifications about specific events related to that item. This dual functionality combines organization with intelligent monitoring.

### What does "watching" mean?

When you "watch" an item (by adding it to Favorites), Tallyfy notifies you when specific events occur. The types of events that trigger notifications depend on what you're watching - not all changes trigger notifications.

### What events trigger notifications for watched items?

Different types of watched items trigger notifications for different events:

#### Templates (Both Procedure and Document Templates)
When you watch any template type, you'll be notified about:
- **Step creation** - When new steps are added to the template
- **Step deletion** - When steps are removed from the template  
- **Assignee changes** - When step assignees are added or removed
- **Form field creation** - When new form fields are added to steps
- **Form field deletion** - When form fields are removed from steps

**Note**: Document templates and procedure templates trigger the same watch events. Changes to document content or descriptions don't trigger notifications.

#### Tasks (Including One-Off Tasks)
When you watch a task, you'll be notified about:
- **Task completion** - When the task is marked as complete

**What does NOT trigger notifications for watched tasks**:
- Assignee changes or additions
- Deadline or due date changes
- Task title or description edits
- Task reopening
- Comments or discussions on the task
- File attachments
- Form field value changes

These changes only create auto-comments within the task itself but don't send watcher notifications.

#### Processes
When you watch a process, you'll be notified about:
- **Task completion** - When any task within the process is completed
- **Process completion** - When the entire process is completed

#### Members
When you watch a team member, you'll be notified when that person:
- **Launches a process** - Creates a new process instance
- **Completes a task** - Finishes any task assigned to them

### How do I access my Favorites?

Click the star icon ⭐ in the left sidebar to open Favorites. This shows all items you've marked.

Clicking the star again unfavorites (and unwatches) the item.

### How do I filter my Favorites?

Within the Favorites section, use the filter options at the top to show only certain item types (e.g., only show favorited processes or favorited tasks).

### How can I set notification preferences for watched items?

For each item in your Favorites list, you can control how and how often you're notified about the events listed above.

*   **Target Options**: Choose *how* you want to be notified:
    *   **Email** - Receive notifications via email (most common)
    *   **Webhook** - Send notifications to external systems via webhook URLs
    ![Notification target options](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-target-options-favorite.png)
    
*   **Notification Frequency**: Choose how often you're notified when events occur:
    *   **Electric**: Get notified immediately when an event happens
    *   **Mindful**: Events are collected and sent as a digest every 3 hours
    *   **Chilled**: Events are collected and sent as a daily digest once per day

You can set different frequencies for different items, letting you get instant alerts for critical items and digest summaries for less urgent ones. The actual events that trigger notifications remain the same regardless of frequency - only the timing of when you receive the notifications changes.

### How do I manage my watched items?

The Favorites section is where you manage watched items:
*   View your full list of favorited/watched items.
*   Change notification settings (frequency/target) for any item.
*   Filter your list.
*   Remove items by clicking the star again (unfavorites/unwatches).
