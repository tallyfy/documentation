## How to create custom views with presets

With the "Create Custom View" feature, you can filter and display processes based on specific criteria of your choice. Whether you want to focus on processes assigned to certain team members, tagged with specific labels, launched using certain templates, or in particular process states, you can create customized views to meet these requirements.

To create a custom view:

1. Head to the Tracker tab and click on the "Create Preset" option.

3. Select the criteria you want to filter by, such as tags or process states.
