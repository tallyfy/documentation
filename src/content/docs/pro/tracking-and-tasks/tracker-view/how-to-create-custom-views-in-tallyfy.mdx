## How to Create and Save Custom Views (Presets) in Tracker

The **[Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** view shows all your running processes, but you can create and save custom filtered views (called "Presets") to quickly see only the processes you care about.

For example, you could create a preset view showing only processes that are assigned to your team, have a specific tag like "Urgent", and are currently overdue.

To create and save a custom view preset:

<Steps>
1. Go to the **Tracker** view.
2. Use the **Add Filter** button to apply all the filters you want for this view (e.g., filter by Assignee, Tag, Status, Template, Folder, etc.). You can add multiple filters.
3. Once the Tracker is showing the exact set of processes you want, click the **Create Preset** button (usually near the filters).

4. Give your preset view a descriptive name (e.g., "My Team's Urgent Issues").
5. Click **Save** (or similar button).

</Steps>

Your saved preset view will now appear (often as a clickable name or tab) in the Tracker view, allowing you to quickly apply that specific combination of filters again in the future.
