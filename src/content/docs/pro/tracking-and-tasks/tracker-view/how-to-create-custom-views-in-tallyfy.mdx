## How to create and save custom views (presets) in Tracker

The **[Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** view shows running processes, but you can create and save filtered views (called "Presets") to quickly see specific processes.

For example, you could create a preset showing processes assigned to your team, tagged "Urgent", and that are overdue.

To create and save a custom view preset:

<Steps>
1. Go to the **Tracker** view.
2. Use the **Add Filter** button to apply the filters you want for this view (e.g., filter by assignee, tag, status, template, folder). You can add multiple filters.
3. Once the Tracker shows the processes you want, click the **Create Preset** button (usually near the filters).

4. Name your preset view clearly (e.g., "My Team's Urgent Issues").
5. Click **Save**.

</Steps>

Your saved preset view will now appear (e.g., as a clickable name or tab) in the Tracker view, allowing you to quickly re-apply that filter combination in the future.
