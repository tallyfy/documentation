## Create custom views in Tracker

Save filtered views as **Presets** in the **[Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** to instantly access specific process subsets. For example, you could create a preset showing processes assigned to your team, tagged "Urgent", and approaching their deadlines.

<Steps>
1. Go to the **Tracker** view.
2. Click **Add Filter** and apply the filters you want - assignee, tag, status, template, or folder. You can combine multiple filters.
3. Once the Tracker shows the right processes, click **Save Preset** near the filters.

4. Name your preset (e.g., "My Team's Urgent Issues").
5. Click **Save**.

Your saved preset appears in the **Custom Views** dropdown in Tracker. Click it to re-apply that filter combination anytime.
