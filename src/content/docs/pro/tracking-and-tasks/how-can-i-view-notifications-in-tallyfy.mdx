## How to view your notifications

Notifications in Tallyfy alert you to important updates, like when you're assigned a task or someone comments on your work.

### Finding your notifications

Look for the notification icon (usually a bell 🔔) in the top-right corner of the Tallyfy screen. A red dot or number usually appears on the icon when you have new, unread notifications.

Clicking this icon typically shows your most recent notifications.

### Viewing all notifications

To see a full history of all your past notifications:

1. Click the notification icon (🔔) in the top-right corner.
2. In the dropdown list that appears, click **VIEW ALL NOTIFICATIONS** (or similar text).

This will take you to a page showing a complete list of your notifications.
