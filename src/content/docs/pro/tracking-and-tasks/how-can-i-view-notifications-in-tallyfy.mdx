## View notifications

Click the bell icon in the top right corner of Tallyfy to open your notifications dropdown. It shows recent alerts, with a link to your full notification history.

Tallyfy notifies you when someone assigns you a task, comments on your work, completes a task you're involved in, reports or resolves an issue, updates a deadline, or mentions you. If you've got unread notifications, a count badge appears on the bell icon.

### How to view all notifications

1. Click the bell icon in the top right corner.
2. In the dropdown, click **VIEW ALL NOTIFICATIONS**.

This takes you to your complete notification history - every alert, update, and message in one place. You can also click **MARK ALL AS READ** to clear your unread count.
