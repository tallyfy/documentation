## How can I view my notifications?

Click the bell icon (ðŸ””) in the top right corner of Tallyfy to see your notifications. The dropdown shows recent alerts, and there's a link to view your complete notification history.

You'll get notifications when someone assigns you a task, comments on your work, or when there's an update that needs your attention. Simple.

### How do I find my notifications?

Look for the notification icon - it's a bell ðŸ”” in the top right corner of your Tallyfy screen. Got new notifications? You'll see a red dot or number on that bell.

Click the bell and you'll see your recent notifications right away.

### How can I view all notifications?

Want to see everything, including older notifications? Here's how:

1. Click the notification icon (ðŸ””) in the top right corner.
2. In the dropdown that appears, click **VIEW ALL NOTIFICATIONS**.

That's it. You're now looking at your complete notification history - every alert, update, and message in one place.
