## How can I view my notifications?

Notifications in Tallyfy alert you to updates, like task assignments or comments on your work. This notification system ensures you stay informed about important workflow activities and requirements.

### How do I find my notifications?

Find the notification icon (usually a bell ðŸ””) in the top right corner of Tallyfy. A red dot or number often appears on the icon if you have new, unread notifications.

Clicking this icon usually shows recent notifications.

### How can I view all notifications?

To see all notifications (including older ones):

1. Click the notification icon (ðŸ””) in the top right corner.
2. In the dropdown list that appears, click **VIEW ALL NOTIFICATIONS** (or similar text).

This will take you to a page listing your complete notification history.
