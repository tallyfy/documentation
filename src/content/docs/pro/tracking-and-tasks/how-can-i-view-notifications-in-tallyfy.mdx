## How to view your notifications

Notifications in Tallyfy alert you to updates, like task assignments or comments on your work.

### Finding your notifications

Find the notification icon (usually a bell ðŸ””) in the top right corner of Tallyfy. A red dot or number often appears on the icon if you have new, unread notifications.

Clicking this icon usually shows recent notifications.

### Viewing all notifications

To see all notifications (including older ones):

1. Click the notification icon (ðŸ””) in the top right corner.
2. In the dropdown list that appears, click **VIEW ALL NOTIFICATIONS** (or similar text).

This will take you to a page listing your complete notification history.
