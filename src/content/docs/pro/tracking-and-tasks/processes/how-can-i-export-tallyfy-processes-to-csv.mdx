## Export processes to CSV format

Export any running [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) to CSV directly from Tallyfy. Open the process, click the **More** menu, and select **Export CSV**. The file downloads in seconds with all tasks, form answers, comments, and timestamps.

This is a Pro plan feature. Light members can't access it.

### What do I need?

- View access to the running process
- Admin or Standard member role (not Light)

### How do I export a process to CSV?

<Steps>
1. Open the running process you want to export.
2. Click the **More** dropdown in the process sub-navigation bar.

4. The CSV file downloads to your computer automatically.
</Steps>

### What's in the CSV file?

Each row represents a task, form field answer, or comment. You get 49 columns covering:

*   **Process info** - name, ID, source template, start/end dates, owner
*   **Task info** - name, status (complete, active, waiting), due dates, completion times, assignees
*   **Milestone data** - IDs, names, and positions for milestone checkpoints
*   **Form field data** - field names, answers, field types, file upload details
*   **Hidden [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/)** - even auto-skipped tasks appear in exports, which helps for audits
*   **Comments and issues** - comment text, issue reports, resolution status

The [CSV file structure article](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/how-is-the-csv-file-structured-in-tallyfy/) covers all 49 columns in detail.

:::note[Timestamp handling in exports]
Timestamps in CSV exports use `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` format without timezone info. In Tallyfy's interface, these same timestamps display in your personal timezone setting.

### Bulk export for multiple processes

For exporting many processes at once, use the open-source Python script in the [api-support repository](https://github.com/tallyfy/api-support/tree/master/Bulk%20Exports). It can:
- Export all processes to a single CSV
- Filter by status (active, complete, or all)
- Filter by template ID
- Handle pagination automatically

```bash
# Export all processes
python3 export_processes_csv.py

# Export only active processes
python3 export_processes_csv.py --status active

# Export processes from specific template
python3 export_processes_csv.py --template YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID
```

The script produces the same 49-column format as manual exports - one row per task. See [API code samples](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/code-samples/) for more programmatic options.

### Alternative export methods

Besides manual CSV export, you can:
- **Use webhooks** to send form data to external systems automatically when tasks complete
- **Connect via API** to pull form field data programmatically
- **Set up middleware** (Zapier, Make) to stream form responses to spreadsheets

See [webhook setup](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/how-to-set-up-webhooks-in-tallyfy/) for automated data export.

### Common uses for exported data

1.  **Analysis** - open in Excel or Google Sheets to measure task durations, find bottlenecks, or compare team performance
2.  **Reporting** - build charts showing completion trends, cycle times, or bottleneck patterns
3.  **Backup** - keep offline copies of important processes for future reference
4.  **Integration** - feed data into Power BI, Tableau, or other analytics tools
5.  **Auditing** - every action, timestamp, and decision is recorded for compliance

:::note[Large files]
Processes with hundreds of tasks may produce large CSV files. Excel and Google Sheets handle most files fine, but for thousands of rows, consider a database tool.
