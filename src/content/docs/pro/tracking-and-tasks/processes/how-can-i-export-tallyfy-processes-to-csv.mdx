## How to export process data to CSV

Tallyfy allows you to export [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) data to CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format for analysis, reporting, and integration with other tools. This guide explains the export process and what you can expect in the exported file.

### Requirements

- You must have access to the process you want to export
- You need permission to view process settings

### Export steps

<Steps>
1. Open the active process you want to export
2. Click the **Settings** button in the top-right corner of the process view

### Understanding the CSV structure

The exported CSV file contains comprehensive process data organized into columns:

Key information included in the export:

#### Process information
- Process name and ID
- [Template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) information
- Start and end dates
- Process owner and creator

#### Task details
- Task names and descriptions
- Task status (complete, in progress, blocked)
- Due dates and completion times
- [Task assignees](/products/pro/documenting/members/)

#### Form field data
- Field types (short text, long text, dropdown, etc.)
- Questions and prompts
- User responses
- File upload references

#### Hidden information
- Hidden [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) are included in the export
- System metadata and tracking information

### Using exported CSV data

The exported data can be used for:

1. **Analysis**: Import into spreadsheet applications to analyze process performance
2. **Reporting**: Create custom reports on process metrics
3. **Data backup**: Maintain offline copies of critical process information
4. **Integration**: Import process data into other business tools
5. **Auditing**: Track process compliance and documentation

:::note[Large exports]
For processes with extensive form fields or numerous [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), the exported CSV may be large. Most spreadsheet applications can handle these files, but very large exports might require specialized data processing tools.
