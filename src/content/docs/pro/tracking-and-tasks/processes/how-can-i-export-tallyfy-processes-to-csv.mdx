## How to export process data to a CSV file

Tallyfy lets you export all the data from a specific running [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) into a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file. This file format can be opened in spreadsheet programs like Excel or Google Sheets, allowing you to analyze, report on, or back up the process information.

### What you need

- Access to view the running process you want to export.

### How to export

<Steps>
1. Open the running process you want to export data from.
2. Click the **Settings** button (usually a gear icon in the top right) for that specific process.

4. Click the **Export CSV** button.

### What's in the CSV file?

The exported CSV file contains a detailed breakdown of the process, organized into columns. Each row represents a piece of information like a task, a form field answer, or a comment. Key details include:

*   **Process Info**: Name, ID, template used, start/end dates, owner.
*   **Task Info**: Task names, status (e.g., complete, active), due dates, completion times, who was assigned.
*   **Form Field Data**: Field names/questions, answers provided by users, file upload details.
*   **Hidden Items**: Even hidden [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) are included in the export.
*   **Metadata**: Other system details and tracking info.

For a detailed look at all 45 columns, see the [CSV File Structure article](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/how-is-the-csv-file-structured-in-tallyfy/).

### How to use the exported data

You can use the CSV file for:

1.  **Analysis**: Open in Excel/Google Sheets to analyze how long tasks took, etc.
2.  **Reporting**: Create charts or reports based on the process data.
3.  **Backup**: Keep an offline copy of the process details.
4.  **Integration**: Import the data into other tools.
5.  **Auditing**: Use the data for compliance checks.

:::note[Large Files]
If a process has many tasks or lots of form data, the exported CSV file can be quite large. Standard spreadsheet programs can usually open them, but very large files might need other data tools.
