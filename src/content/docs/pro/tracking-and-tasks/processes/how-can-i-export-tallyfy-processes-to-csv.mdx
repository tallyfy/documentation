Key information included in the export:

#### Process information
- Process name and ID
- Template information
- Start and end dates
- Process owner and creator

#### Task details
- Task names and descriptions
- Task status (complete, in progress, blocked)
- Due dates and completion times
- Task assignees

#### Form field data
- Field types (short text, long text, dropdown, etc.)
- Questions and prompts
- User responses
- File upload references

#### Hidden information
- Hidden tasks are included in the export
- System metadata and tracking information

### Using exported CSV data

The exported data can be used for:

1. **Analysis**: Import into spreadsheet applications to analyze process performance
2. **Reporting**: Create custom reports on process metrics
3. **Data backup**: Maintain offline copies of critical process information
4. **Integration**: Import process data into other business tools
5. **Auditing**: Track process compliance and documentation

:::note[Large exports]
For processes with extensive form fields or numerous tasks, the exported CSV may be large. Most spreadsheet applications can handle these files, but very large exports might require specialized data processing tools.
