## Process lifecycle in Tallyfy

Processes in Tallyfy follow five phases: create, launch, execute, monitor, and complete.

### Process lifecycle phases

A process moves through Tallyfy in these phases:

1. **Creation** - You build the template (like designing the train route)
2. **Launch** - You start a new instance (the train leaves the station)
3. **Execution** - Tasks get completed one by one (passengers board at each stop)
4. **Monitoring** - You track progress in real-time (watching the train's location)
5. **Completion** - Everything wraps up and you analyze results (reaching the destination)

### Creating templates

Key elements:

- **Organize logically**: Put steps in the order people actually work - not how the org chart says they should
- **Add detailed instructions**: Write them like you're explaining to someone on their first day (because someday, you will be)
- **Set proper assignments**: Match tasks to job titles, not just people. New hire? They'll automatically get the right work
- **Include form fields**: Capture the data you need when you need it - no chasing people for missing info
- **Configure automations**: Let Tallyfy handle the boring stuff. Auto-assign tasks, set deadlines, send reminders

### Launching processes

Steps:

- **Customize for the specific instance**: Every client onboarding is different - adjust deadlines and assignments to match reality
- **Provide context**: Add launch notes to explain the specific situation
- **Send notifications**: Alert assignees about their new tasks
- **Verify settings**: Double-check assignments and deadlines before launch

### Monitoring active processes

The tracker view shows all active processes:

- **Use the Tracker view**: See which processes are humming along and which need attention. Green means go, red means investigate
- **Check process health**: That task stuck for 3 days? Time to nudge someone or reassign it
- **Review comments**: The real story often lives in task comments - questions, blockers, "waiting on vendor" updates
- **Monitor form data**: Spot incomplete submissions before they mess up your reporting
- **Handle exceptions**: When the unexpected happens (and it will), you'll see it here first

### Process tracking best practices

Effective tracking habits:

- **Regular check-ins**: Monday morning dashboard review, Thursday afternoon deep dive - pick a rhythm and stick to it
- **Dashboard utilization**: View patterns across all processes - multiple items stuck at the same step indicates a bottleneck
- **Notification management**: Configure alerts for critical events only
- **Deadline tracking**: Check for tasks turning yellow (due soon) before they go red (overdue)
- **Issue resolution**: Answer questions in comments quickly to prevent blockers

### Process completion

Checklist:

- **Verify all tasks are complete**: Check for any forgotten approvals or signatures
- **Review captured data**: Confirm all required fields have values
- **Export data if needed**: Extract data for reports or audits
- **Archive for reference**: Store completed processes for future reference
- **Learn and improve**: Identify consistently late or skipped steps to adjust the template

### Common challenges and solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Bottlenecks | Check who's overloaded - if Sarah has 15 tasks and Tom has 2, time to rebalance |
| Missed deadlines | Build in buffer time. If it really takes 3 days, don't set a 2-day deadline |
| Incomplete data | Make critical fields required. Can't proceed without a PO number? Make it mandatory |
| Process abandonment | Set up a 48-hour reminder rule - gentle nudge before things go stale |
| Unclear responsibility | Name names. "Marketing team" is vague. "Content Manager" is clear |
| Missed steps | Every task appears in someone's queue - Tallyfy won't let steps vanish |
| Downstream problems | Daily tracker check catches issues while they're still small |

### Analyzing processes

After 10-20 runs:

- **Review completion times**: Check actual vs. expected durations. For accurate effort measurement, see [how to track time spent on tasks](/products/pro/tutorials/how-to/track-time-in-tasks/)
- **Identify patterns**: When three different processes stall at legal review, you've found your bottleneck
- **Collect feedback**: Ask team members for specific pain points
- **Implement changes**: Adjust one element at a time and test
- **Monitor improvements**: Check metrics after 5-10 runs to verify changes worked
