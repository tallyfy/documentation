## Process lifecycle in Tallyfy

Every process moves through five phases: create, launch, execute, monitor, and complete.

### The five phases

1. **Creation** - Build the template with steps, assignments, and form fields
2. **Launch** - Start a named instance with customized settings
3. **Execution** - Assignees complete tasks one by one
4. **Monitoring** - Track progress and catch issues early
5. **Completion** - All tasks finish and you review the results

### Creating templates

- **Order steps logically** - match the order people actually do the work
- **Write clear instructions** - explain each step as if it's someone's first day
- **Assign by role** - use groups so new hires automatically get the right tasks
- **Add form fields** - capture data at the point it's needed
- **Set up automations** - auto-assign tasks, set deadlines, trigger reminders

### Launching processes

- **Customize the instance** - adjust deadlines and assignments for this specific run
- **Name it clearly** - Tallyfy can auto-name processes using a format you define in the template
- **Notifications go out automatically** - assignees get alerted about new tasks
- **Verify before launch** - check assignments and deadlines look right

### Monitoring active processes

The Tracker view shows all active processes at a glance.

- **Spot status fast** - processes show as active, complete, or flagged with a problem
- **Check stuck tasks** - something sitting for 3 days? Nudge someone or reassign it
- **Read comments** - blockers and "waiting on vendor" updates live in task comments
- **Review form data** - catch incomplete submissions before they cause downstream issues

### Tracking best practices

- **Pick a rhythm** - Monday morning review, Thursday deep dive - whatever works
- **Watch for patterns** - multiple processes stuck at the same step? That's a bottleneck
- **Tune alerts** - only get notified for events that actually matter
- **Check deadlines early** - catch approaching due dates before tasks go overdue

### Completing a process

A process moves to "complete" status once all its tasks are done and the kick-off form (if any) is submitted. Then:

- **Verify captured data** - confirm required fields have values
- **Export if needed** - pull data for reports or audits
- **Archive** - store completed processes for future reference
- **Improve the template** - find steps that were consistently late or skipped, then adjust

### Common challenges

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Bottlenecks | Check workloads - if one person has 15 tasks and another has 2, rebalance |
| Missed deadlines | Build in buffer. If it really takes 3 days, don't set a 2-day deadline |
| Incomplete data | Make critical fields required so people can't skip them |
| Abandonment | Set up a reminder rule - a nudge before things go stale |
| Unclear responsibility | Assign to specific roles. "Marketing team" is vague - "Content Manager" is clear |
| Missed steps | Every task lands in someone's queue. Tallyfy won't let steps vanish |
| Downstream issues | A daily Tracker check catches problems while they're still small |

### Analyzing after multiple runs

After 10-20 runs, you'll have enough data to spot trends.

- **Compare completion times** - check actual vs. expected durations. For effort tracking, see [how to track time spent on tasks](/products/pro/tutorials/how-to/track-time-in-tasks/)
- **Find recurring stalls** - three processes stuck at legal review? That's your bottleneck
- **Ask your team** - collect specific pain points from the people doing the work
- **Change one thing at a time** - adjust a single element, then check metrics after 5-10 more runs
