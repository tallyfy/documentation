  that represents actual work being done with its own unique identity activity log
  and ability to be tracked and modified independently from the original template.

## What is a process in Tallyfy?

A process is a running instance of a template - it's your Tallyfy workflow in action. Here's the key difference:

*   A **[Template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)** is like a master recipe or blueprint for a standard workflow task (e.g., the steps for onboarding a new employee)
*   A **Process** is a *single time* you execute that template for a specific case (e.g., the actual onboarding process for *Jane Doe* that you started today)

### Why are workflow processes essential for business operations?

Processes are the heart of getting actual work done in Tallyfy - they transform your templates into real, trackable workflows.

Templates tell you how work should be done. Processes? They're the actual work happening right now. Understanding this distinction matters because:

- Processes are what you track daily
- Processes are where team members collaborate  
- Processes are how you measure real progress

Clear processes with unique identities help prevent confusion, enable proper tracking, and provide valuable data for continuous improvements.

Every time you need to execute the work defined in a template, you **[launch](/products/pro/launching/)** that template to create a new, unique process instance that you can track.

This workflow approach applies to any repeatable business process, big or small.

## How should I name workflow processes?

Give each launched process a unique, descriptive name so you can differentiate them (e.g., "Onboard Jane Doe", "Onboard John Smith"). This takes seconds but saves hours of confusion later.

Want to save even more time? Set up **auto-naming** in Tallyfy template settings (`Settings > Summary > Auto-naming`). This feature automatically creates process names based on information entered in required kick-off form fields - the project names pull directly from the data users enter during process launch.

:::note[Auto-naming rules]
- Auto-naming only uses **required** kick-off [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/).
- The generated name cannot be longer than 550 characters.
- This dynamic project naming from field inputs ensures consistent, meaningful process names without manual effort.

## What are the key characteristics of Tallyfy processes?

*   A process is a copy of its template *at the moment it was launched*. Later template changes? They won't touch processes already running
*   You can launch many processes from the same template
*   A process can be based on a [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) (with workflow steps) or a [document template](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) (like a fillable form)
*   You can add extra one-off [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to a running process if needed
*   Each process has its own unique activity log (audit trail) for compliance tracking

:::tip[Adding extra tasks]
If something unexpected comes up, you can add new tasks (regular, approval, email, etc.) directly to a running process without changing the original template. See [Add tasks to active processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/edit-processes/how-can-i-add-tasks-to-active-processes-on-tallyfy/).

:::note[Template vs. Blueprint]
Reminder: In the Tallyfy app, we say **Template**. In the technical API documentation, it's called a **Blueprint**.

## What happens when a process is completed?

Completed processes remain visible in your Tracker view by default. Here's how to clean up your active views while preserving the data:

- **Archive processes**: Click the three-dot menu (...) on any process card in the Tracker view
- **View archived processes**: Filter by "Status = Archived" in the Tracker view
- **Restore processes**: Unarchive them anytime if you need to reference them again

Need step-by-step instructions? See [how to archive and unarchive processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/organize-processes/how-to-archive-and-unarchive-processes-in-tallyfy/).

## What should I learn next?

You've got the basics of Tallyfy processes down. Ready to put them to work? Check out the [Tracker view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/) to monitor workflow progress in real-time.

Need to modify processes after launch? Learn how to [add tasks to active processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/edit-processes/how-can-i-add-tasks-to-active-processes-on-tallyfy/) for maximum flexibility.
