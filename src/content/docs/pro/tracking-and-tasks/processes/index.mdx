snippet: A process represents a specific instance of following a template's workflow
  where teams track progress collaborate and execute real work while maintaining unique
  identities for proper monitoring and future improvements.
title: More about processes

## What is a process?

*   A **[Template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)** is like a master recipe or blueprint for a standard task (e.g., the steps for onboarding a new employee).
*   A **Process** is a *single time* you follow that recipe for a specific case (e.g., the actual onboarding process for *Jane Doe* that you started today).

### Why processes are essential

Processes are the heart of getting actual work done in Tallyfy. While templates define how work should be done, processes represent real, active instances of work being executed. Understanding processes is critical because they're what you track daily, where team members collaborate, and how you measure real progress. Clear processes with unique identities help prevent confusion, enable proper tracking, and provide valuable data for future improvements.

Every time you need to do the work defined in a template, you **[launch](/products/pro/launching/)** it to create a new, unique process instance that you can track.

This applies to any repeatable workflow, big or small.

## Naming processes

It's important to give each launched process a unique, descriptive name so you can tell them apart (e.g., "Onboard Jane Doe", "Onboard John Smith").

You can also set up **auto-naming** in the template settings (`Settings > Summary > Auto-naming`) to automatically create names based on information entered in required kick-off form fields.

:::note[Auto-naming rules]
- Auto-naming only uses **required** kick-off [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/).
- The generated name cannot be longer than 550 characters.

## Key things about processes

*   A process is a copy of its template *at the moment it was launched*. Later changes to the template don't affect processes already running.
*   You can launch many processes from the same template.
*   A process can be based on a [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) (with steps) or a [document template](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) (like a fillable form).
*   You can add extra one-off [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to a running process if needed.
*   Each process has its own unique activity log (audit trail).

:::tip[Adding extra tasks]
If something unexpected comes up, you can add new tasks (regular, approval, email, etc.) directly to a running process without changing the original template. See [Add tasks to active processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/edit-processes/how-can-i-add-tasks-to-active-processes-on-tallyfy/).

:::note[Template vs. Blueprint]
Reminder: In the Tallyfy app, we say **Template**. In the technical API documentation, it's called a **Blueprint**.

Now that you understand what processes are, learn how to track them effectively using the [Tracker view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/) to monitor progress. If you need to modify processes after launch, explore how to [add tasks to active processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/edit-processes/how-can-i-add-tasks-to-active-processes-on-tallyfy/) for maximum flexibility.
