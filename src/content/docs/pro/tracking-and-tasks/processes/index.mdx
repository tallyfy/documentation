### What is a process?

Think of a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) as a **master blueprint** for a standardized task, like building a specific type of house or, in a business context, onboarding a new employee. The template lays out all the standard steps and requirements.

A **[process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)** is like the **actual construction project** you start using that blueprint. Each time you need to perform the task (e.g., onboard a *specific* new employee), you **[launch](/products/pro/launching/)** a process from the template. This creates a unique, trackable instance of that workflow.

For example, you might have a template outlining the steps for new employee onboarding. If you hire someone new tomorrow, you would launch that template as a new process specifically for **that** employee. While the steps come from the template, this launched process is distinct and tracks the onboarding for just that individual.

This concept applies equally to large, complex operations and the smaller, niche 'long-tail' workflows that teams manage daily. Any repeatable task, big or small, can be defined in a template and then launched as a specific process when needed.

You should set a naming convention for your processes to be able to find them quickly. You can also auto-name your processes by setting this in the template editor via Settings > Summary > Auto-naming.

:::note[Auto-naming uses required fields only]
The auto-naming feature only works with required kick-off [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) in your template. This ensures that the fields used for naming will always contain values, as they are mandatory when launching the process.
:::

:::note[Auto-naming character limit]
The auto-naming feature has a maximum limit of 550 characters. When setting up auto-naming in your template settings, ensure that your naming pattern (including field variables) doesn't exceed this limit.
:::

A process is a copy of a template at the time of launch. You can launch as many processes from a single template as you need. Each process should have a unique name to identify it e.g. "Jane Doe", "John Ramirez", etc. Discover more about how to[launch a process](/products/pro/launching/how-can-i-launch-a-process-in-tallyfy/).

* You can launch a **[document](/products/pro/documenting/documents/)** or a **[procedure](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)** depending on the underlying template you are launching.
* You can add one-off or ad-hoc [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) into a process.
* A process has a unique audit trail of who did what.

:::tip[Enhance processes with ad-hoc tasks]
You're not limited to just the [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) defined in the original template! After launching a process, you can add any type of ad-hoc one-off task (regular tasks, approval tasks, email tasks, etc.) to adapt the process to specific circumstances. This flexibility allows you to customize each process instance without modifying the underlying template.
