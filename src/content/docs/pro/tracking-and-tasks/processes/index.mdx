## Processes in Tallyfy

A process is a running instance of a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). Here's the key difference:

*   A **Template** is a reusable blueprint for a workflow (e.g., the steps for onboarding a new employee)
*   A **Process** is one specific execution of that template (e.g., onboarding *Jane Doe* starting today)

:::tip[Can't find where you added a task?]
**Added a task but it disappeared?** You probably added it to a running process, not the template:
- Tasks added to a **running process** only exist in that specific instance
- Tasks added to a **template** appear in all future processes launched from it
- To update the template: go to **Templates** tab, edit your template, and add the task there
- To add a task to one process only: open that process and use **Add Task**
:::

### Why processes matter

Templates define how work should be done. Processes are the actual work happening now.

- Processes are what you track daily
- Processes are where team members collaborate
- Processes are how you measure real progress

Every time you need to run the work defined in a template, you **[launch](/products/pro/launching/)** it to create a new, trackable process instance.

## How should I name processes?

Give each process a unique, descriptive name so you can tell them apart (e.g., "Onboard Jane Doe", "Onboard John Smith"). Takes seconds, saves hours.

You can also set up **auto-naming** in template settings (**Settings > Summary > Auto-naming**). Tallyfy then builds process names from kick-off [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) values entered at launch.

:::note[Auto-naming rules]
- Auto-naming pulls from kick-off form fields referenced in the name format. Required fields are guaranteed to have values at launch.
- Process names can't exceed 550 characters.

## Key characteristics

*   A process is a snapshot of its template *at launch time*. Later template changes won't affect processes already running.

:::important[Template updates don't affect running processes]
When you update a template, existing processes keep their original version. This is by design:

1. **State determination** - no way to know where to insert new steps in a partially-complete process
2. **Relevance** - new steps might not apply to processes started under different conditions
3. **Step removal** - can't safely remove completed steps that hold important data

**Workaround for long-running processes** (like 6+ month sales cycles):
- Use **Add Task** to manually add new steps to running processes
- Consider shorter process cycles with handoffs between templates
- For major changes, complete existing processes and launch new ones
:::
*   You can launch many processes from the same template
*   A process can be based on a [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) (with workflow steps) or a [document template](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) (a fillable form)
*   You can add extra one-off [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to any running process
*   Each process has its own activity log (audit trail)

:::tip[Adding extra tasks]
Something unexpected came up? Add new tasks (regular, approval, email, etc.) directly to a running process without changing the original template. See [Add tasks to active processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/edit-processes/how-can-i-add-tasks-to-active-processes-on-tallyfy/).
:::

:::note[Template vs. Blueprint]
In the Tallyfy app, it's called a **Template**. In the API, it's called a **Blueprint** (model name: `Checklist`).
:::

## What happens when a process completes?

Completed processes stay visible in your Tracker view. To clean up your view while keeping the data:

- **Archive** - click the three-dot menu (...) on any process card in the Tracker view
- **View archived** - filter by **Status = Archived** in the Tracker view
- **Restore** - unarchive anytime to bring a process back

See [how to archive and unarchive processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/organize-processes/how-to-archive-and-unarchive-processes-in-tallyfy/) for full steps.

:::note[Archive vs. Delete]
**Archiving** removes a process from active views but keeps all data. You can restore it anytime.

**Deleting** permanently removes the process and all its data - this can't be undone. You must archive a process first, then delete it from the archived view. Only Admin users can permanently delete. Archiving is almost always the better choice.
