snippet: A process represents a unique instance of a template blueprint that tracks
  specific workflow execution with customizable tasks audit trails and the ability
  to add ad-hoc items while maintaining distinct identification for each launched
  instance.
title: More about processes

### What is a process?

*   A **[Template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)** is like a master recipe or blueprint for a standard task (e.g., the steps for onboarding a new employee).
*   A **Process** is a *single time* you follow that recipe for a specific case (e.g., the actual onboarding process for *Jane Doe* that you started today).

Every time you need to do the work defined in a template, you **[launch](/products/pro/launching/)** it to create a new, unique process instance that you can track.

This applies to any repeatable workflow, big or small.

### Naming Processes

It's important to give each launched process a unique, descriptive name so you can tell them apart (e.g., "Onboard Jane Doe", "Onboard John Smith").

You can also set up **auto-naming** in the template settings (Settings > Summary > Auto-naming) to automatically create names based on information entered in required kick-off form fields.

:::note[Auto-naming rules]
- Auto-naming only uses **required** kick-off [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/).
- The generated name cannot be longer than 550 characters.
:::

### Key things about Processes:

*   A process is a copy of its template *at the moment it was launched*. Later changes to the template don't affect processes already running.
*   You can launch many processes from the same template.
*   A process can be based on a [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) (with steps) or a [document template](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) (like a fillable form).
*   You can add extra one-off [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to a running process if needed.
*   Each process has its own unique activity log (audit trail).

:::tip[Adding extra tasks]
If something unexpected comes up, you can add new tasks (regular, approval, email, etc.) directly to a running process without changing the original template. See [Add tasks to active processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/edit-processes/how-can-i-add-tasks-to-active-processes-on-tallyfy/).

:::note[Template vs. Blueprint]
Reminder: In the Tallyfy app, we say **Template**. In the technical API documentation, it's called a **Blueprint**.
