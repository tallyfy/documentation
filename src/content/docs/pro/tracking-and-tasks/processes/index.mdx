## What is a process?

A process is an instance of a template, for example, you may have a template that establishes the steps to be followed to onboard a new employee. If you were to onboard a new employee tomorrow, you would need to "Launch" this process to follow the steps required to onboard **this** particular employee.

You should set a naming convention for your processes to be able to find them quickly. You can also auto-name your processes by setting this in the template editor via Settings > Summary > Auto-naming.

A process is a copy of a template at the time of launch. You can launch as many processes from a single template as you need. Each process should have a unique name to identify it e.g. "Jane Doe", "John Ramirez", etc. Discover more about how to[launch a process](/products/pro/launching/how-can-i-launch-a-process-in-tallyfy/).

* You can launch a **document** or a **procedure** depending on the underlying template you are launching.
* You can add one-off or ad-hoc tasks into a process.
* A process has a unique audit trail of who did what.
