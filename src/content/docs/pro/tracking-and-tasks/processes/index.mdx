### What is a process?

Think of a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) as a **master blueprint** for a standardized task, like building a specific type of house or, in a business context, onboarding a new employee. The template lays out all the standard steps and requirements.

A **[process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)** is like the **actual construction project** you start using that blueprint. Each time you need to perform the task (e.g., onboard a *specific* new employee), you **[launch](/products/pro/launching/)** a process from the template. This creates a unique, trackable instance of that workflow.

For example, you might have a template outlining the steps for new employee onboarding. If you hire someone new tomorrow, you would launch that template as a new process specifically for **that** employee. While the steps come from the template, this launched process is distinct and tracks the onboarding for just that individual.

You should set a naming convention for your processes to be able to find them quickly. You can also auto-name your processes by setting this in the template editor via Settings > Summary > Auto-naming.

:::note[Auto-naming uses required fields only]
The auto-naming feature only works with required kick-off [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) in your template. This ensures that the fields used for naming will always contain values, as they are mandatory when launching the process.
:::

:::note[Auto-naming character limit]
The auto-naming feature has a maximum limit of 550 characters. When setting up auto-naming in your template settings, ensure that your naming pattern (including field variables) doesn't exceed this limit.
:::

A process is a copy of a template at the time of launch. You can launch as many processes from a single template as you need. Each process should have a unique name to identify it e.g. "Jane Doe", "John Ramirez", etc. Discover more about how to[launch a process](/products/pro/launching/how-can-i-launch-a-process-in-tallyfy/).

* You can launch a **[document](/products/pro/documenting/documents/)** or a **[procedure](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)** depending on the underlying template you are launching.
* You can add one-off or ad-hoc [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) into a process.
* A process has a unique audit trail of who did what.

:::tip[Enhance processes with ad-hoc tasks]
You're not limited to just the [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) defined in the original template! After launching a process, you can add any type of ad-hoc one-off task (regular tasks, approval tasks, email tasks, etc.) to adapt the process to specific circumstances. This flexibility allows you to customize each process instance without modifying the underlying template.
