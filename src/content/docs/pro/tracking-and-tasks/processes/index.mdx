## What is a process in Tallyfy?

*   A **[Template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)** is like a master recipe or blueprint for a standard workflow task (e.g., the steps for onboarding a new employee)
*   A **Process** is a *single time* you execute that template for a specific case (e.g., the actual onboarding process for *Jane Doe* that you started today)

### Why are workflow processes essential for business operations?

Processes are the heart of getting actual work done in Tallyfy.

While templates define how work should be done, processes represent real, active instances of work being executed. Understanding processes is critical because:

- Processes are what you track daily
- Processes are where team members collaborate
- Processes are how you measure real progress

Clear processes with unique identities help prevent confusion, enable proper tracking, and provide valuable data for future improvements.

Every time you need to execute the work defined in a template, you **[launch](/products/pro/launching/)** that template to create a new, unique process instance that you can track.

This workflow approach applies to any repeatable business process, big or small.

## How should I name workflow processes?

It's important to give each launched process a unique, descriptive name so you can differentiate them (e.g., "Onboard Jane Doe", "Onboard John Smith").

You can also set up **auto-naming** in Tallyfy template settings (`Settings > Summary > Auto-naming`) to automatically create process names based on information entered in required kick-off form fields.

:::note[Auto-naming rules]
- Auto-naming only uses **required** kick-off [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/).
- The generated name cannot be longer than 550 characters.

## What are the key characteristics of Tallyfy processes?

*   A process is a copy of its template *at the moment it was launched*. Later changes to the template don't affect processes already running
*   You can launch many processes from the same template
*   A process can be based on a [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) (with workflow steps) or a [document template](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) (like a fillable form)
*   You can add extra one-off [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to a running process if needed
*   Each process has its own unique activity log (audit trail) for compliance tracking

:::tip[Adding extra tasks]
If something unexpected comes up, you can add new tasks (regular, approval, email, etc.) directly to a running process without changing the original template. See [Add tasks to active processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/edit-processes/how-can-i-add-tasks-to-active-processes-on-tallyfy/).

:::note[Template vs. Blueprint]
Reminder: In the Tallyfy app, we say **Template**. In the technical API documentation, it's called a **Blueprint**.

## What should I learn next?

Now that you understand what Tallyfy processes are, learn how to track them effectively using the [Tracker view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/) to monitor workflow progress.

If you need to modify processes after launch, explore how to [add tasks to active processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/edit-processes/how-can-i-add-tasks-to-active-processes-on-tallyfy/) for maximum flexibility.
