## Why auto-name processes?

Auto-naming creates a consistent naming pattern for every [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) launched from a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). It pulls values directly from your kick-off form fields and builds the process name automatically - so you don't end up with "Untitled" or inconsistent names across your team.

## How do I set it up?

Configure auto-naming once in your template. Every process launched from it gets a properly structured name.

<Steps>
1. Open the template in **Edit** mode.
2. Click the **Settings** (or **Config**) button in the top toolbar.

3. Go to the **Summary** tab.
4. Find **Auto-name Process?** and switch it to **Yes**.
5. A text box appears where you define your naming pattern.
6. Type static text (like "Onboarding -") and insert [variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/) using the **{}** button. You can also insert a built-in **Date** or **Template Name** variable. Field variables pull from your **required** kick-off form fields.
7. Save your settings.
</Steps>

When someone launches a process, Tallyfy fills in the variable values from the kick-off form and generates the name. No manual typing needed.

:::note[Only required kick-off fields work]
You can only use variables from **required** [kick-off form fields](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/) in your naming pattern. Textarea, file upload, and table fields can't be used as variables. Required fields always have values - so your process names won't end up with blanks.
:::

:::note[Name length limit]
Process names max out at 550 characters. That's plenty for most patterns, but keep it reasonable if you're combining many variables.
:::

:::note[Allow launcher to change name]
When auto-naming is on, you'll see a second toggle - **Allow launcher to change name**. If set to **No**, the person launching the process can't edit the auto-generated name. If set to **Yes**, they'll see a pencil icon to override it.
