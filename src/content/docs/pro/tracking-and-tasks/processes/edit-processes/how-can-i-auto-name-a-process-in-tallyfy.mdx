## How to automatically name a process

To maintain consistency in your processes created from a template in Tallyfy, you can use the Auto-Name feature. Here's how:

1. Go to the Template Editor and click on "Config" in the top right corner.

2. In the "Summary" tab, locate the "Auto-name Process?" button.

3. Enable the feature by setting it to "Yes." This allows you to customize the process name and even utilize variables in the Kick off form.

:::note[Required fields only]
At present, auto-naming only includes the required kick-off form fields in your template. The reason that only required fields are usable for auto-naming is that they must exist for naming purposes, and since they are required, Tallyfy can be assured that they will contain something and not be empty.
