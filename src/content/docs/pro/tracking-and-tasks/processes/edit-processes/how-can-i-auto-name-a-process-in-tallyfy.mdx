## Setting up automatic process naming

To ensure consistent and informative names for the [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) launched from a specific [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), you can set up an automatic naming pattern.

<Steps>
1. Open the template in **Edit** mode.
2. Click the **Settings** (or **Config**) button in the top toolbar.
   ![Config button in template editor](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-click-config-template.png)
3. Go to the **Summary** tab.
4. Find the **Auto-name Process?** option and switch it to **Yes**.
5. A box will appear where you can define the naming pattern.
6. You can type standard text (like "Onboarding for:") and insert [variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/) using the **{}** button. These variables will pull data from your **required** kick-off form fields.
7. Save your settings.
</Steps>

Now, when someone launches a process from this template, Tallyfy will automatically generate the process name based on your pattern and the data entered into the required kick-off fields.

:::note[Only Required Kick-off Fields Work]
Currently, you can only use variables from **required** [kick-off form fields](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/) in the auto-name pattern. This ensures the fields always have a value to use in the name.
:::

:::note[Name Length Limit]
The automatically generated process name cannot be longer than 550 characters. Keep this in mind when designing your naming pattern.
