## Why should I auto-name processes?

Manually naming each Tallyfy [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) can lead to inconsistencies. Different people might use different naming styles, making it hard to find and track specific processes later. For example, one person might name a client onboarding process "Coca Cola onboarding", while another names a similar one "Pepsi project".

Auto-naming solves this by creating a consistent naming pattern for every process launched from a specific [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). This ensures all processes follow the same structure, making them easily identifiable and comparable. Using the example above, auto-naming could ensure both processes are named consistently, like "Onboarding - Coca Cola - Memphis" and "Onboarding - Pepsi - New York". This precise naming helps you quickly understand what each process is about and keeps your process tracking organized.

Here's a comparison showing how auto-naming improves clarity of process names:

| Bad Naming (Inconsistent/Manual) | Good Naming (Consistent/Auto-Named) |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Onboarding Client                | Onboarding - Coca Cola - Memphis      |
| Acme Corp                        | Onboarding - Pepsi - New York         |
| New Hire                         | New Hire - Jane Smith - Marketing     |
| John Doe Start                   | New Hire - Bob Johnson - Engineering  |

## How do I set up automatic process naming?

To ensure consistent and informative names for the [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) launched from a specific [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), you can set up an automatic naming pattern.

<Steps>
1. Open the template in **Edit** mode.
2. Click the **Settings** (or **Config**) button in the top toolbar.
   ![Config button in template editor](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-click-config-template.png)
3. Go to the **Summary** tab.
4. Find the **Auto-name Process?** option and switch it to **Yes**.
5. A box will appear where you can define the naming pattern.
6. You can type standard text (like "Onboarding for:") and insert [variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/) using the **{}** button. These variables will pull data from your **required** kick-off form fields.
7. Save your settings.
</Steps>

Now, when someone launches a process from this template, Tallyfy will automatically generate the process name based on your pattern and the data entered into the required kick-off fields.

:::note[Only Required Kick-off Fields Work]
Currently, you can only use variables from **required** [kick-off form fields](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/) in the auto-name pattern. This ensures the fields always have a value to use in the name.
:::

:::note[Name Length Limit]
The automatically generated process name cannot be longer than 550 characters. Keep this in mind when designing your naming pattern.
