## How to set up automatic process naming

To maintain consistency in your [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) created from a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in Tallyfy, you can use the Auto-Name feature. Here's how:

<Steps>
1. Go to the Template Editor and click on "Config" in the top right corner.

2. In the "Summary" tab, locate the "Auto-name Process?" button.

3. Enable the feature by setting it to "Yes." This allows you to customize the process name and even utilize [variables](/products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/) in the Kick off form.
</Steps>

:::note[Required fields only]
At present, auto-naming only includes the required kick-off [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) in your template. The reason that only required fields are usable for auto-naming is that they must exist for naming purposes, and since they are required, Tallyfy can be assured that they will contain something and not be empty.
:::

:::note[Character limit]
The auto-naming feature has a maximum limit of 550 characters. When setting up auto-naming in your [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), ensure that your naming pattern (including field variables) doesn't exceed this limit.
