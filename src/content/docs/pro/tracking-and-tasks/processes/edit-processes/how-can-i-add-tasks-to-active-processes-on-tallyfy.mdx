## Why add tasks to a running process?

Tallyfy allows you to add [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to active [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) after they have been launched. This feature is useful when you need to add steps that were not initially included in the process.

## Adding ad-hoc tasks

There are two primary ways to add a new task to an already running process:

### Method 1: Add directly within the process view

<Steps>
1. Open the active process where you want to add a task.
2. Scroll down to the bottom of the task list.
3. Enter a name for your new task in the **"Add task"** field.

4. Click the plus (+) icon or press Enter to add the basic task.
5. Click the newly added task to open its details panel.
6. Configure the task details (Type, Description, Assignees, Deadline, Advanced Options, Position) as needed.
7. Click **Save Changes** or close the details panel. The task is now part of the active process.
8. To edit the task later, click the three dots icon next to it.
9. To remove the linked task, click the three dots icon and select **Unlink from Process**.
</Steps>

### Method 2: Link an existing One-Off Task

<Steps>
1. First, [create a one-off task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-create-a-one-off-task-in-tallyfy/) with the necessary details (Name, Type, Description, Assignees, Deadline, etc.).
2. In the task creation panel for the one-off task, scroll down to the **Advanced** settings section.
3. Under **Link to Process**, select the active process you want to link this task to.
4. Choose the step in the active process that the new task should precede or follow.

5. Click **Create Task**.
6. The one-off task will now appear at the specified position in your active process.
7. To edit the task later, click the three dots icon next to it.
8. To remove the linked task, click the three dots icon and select **Unlink from Process**.
</Steps>

### Notes on added tasks
*   You can add multiple ad-hoc tasks to a process.
*   Tasks added this way are often marked visually (e.g., "Linked to") to show they weren't part of the original template.
*   Adding tasks to a running process does **not** change the original template.
