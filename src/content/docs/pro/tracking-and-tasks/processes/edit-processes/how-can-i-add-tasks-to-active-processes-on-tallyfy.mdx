## Add tasks to active processes

You can add new [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) in Tallyfy - even after launch. No need to restart the process or touch the original template.

There are two ways to do this.

### Method 1: Add tasks directly in the process view

<Steps>
1. Open the active process where you want to add a task.
2. Scroll to the bottom of the task list.
3. Type a name in the **"Add task"** field.

4. Click the plus (+) icon or press Enter.
5. Click the new task to open its details panel.
6. Set the task details - type, description, assignees, deadline, and position.
7. Close the details panel. The task is now part of the active process.
8. To edit later, click the three-dot menu next to the task.
9. To remove it, click the three-dot menu and select **Unlink from process**.
</Steps>

### Method 2: Link an existing one-off task

<Steps>
1. [Create a one-off task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-create-a-one-off-task-in-tallyfy/) with the details you need (name, type, assignees, deadline, etc.).
2. In the task creation panel, scroll to the **Advanced** settings section.
3. Under **Link to process**, select the active process you want to link this task to.
4. Choose the position - beginning, end, or after a specific task in the process.

5. Click **Create Task**.
6. The one-off task now appears at your chosen position in the active process.
7. To edit later, click the three-dot menu next to the task.
8. To remove it, click the three-dot menu and select **Unlink from process**.
</Steps>

### Things to know about added tasks

- There's no limit on how many tasks you can add.
- Added tasks show a "Linked to" indicator so you can tell them apart from original template tasks.
- Adding tasks to a running process does **not** change your original template.

:::note
The template must have ad-hoc tasks enabled (this is on by default). If it's been disabled, you'll see an "Ad-hoc tasks not allowed for this process" error.
