## How can I add tasks to active processes in Tallyfy?

You can add new [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) in Tallyfy - even after they've already launched. This gives you the flexibility to adapt workflows on the fly when requirements change.

Need an extra approval step? Forgot something important? No problem. You can add tasks without restarting the process or changing the original template.

### What are my options for adding tasks on the fly?

Tallyfy gives you two ways to add tasks to a running process. Pick whichever works best for your situation:

### Method 1: How do I add tasks directly within the process view?

<Steps>
1. Open the active process where you want to add a task.
2. Scroll down to the bottom of the task list.
3. Enter a name for your new task in the **"Add task"** field.

4. Click the plus (+) icon or press Enter to add the basic task.
5. Click the newly added task to open its details panel.
6. Configure the task details (Type, Description, Assignees, Deadline, Advanced Options, Position) as needed.
7. Click **Save Changes** or close the details panel. The task is now part of the active process.
8. To edit the task later, click the three dots icon next to it.
9. To remove the linked task, click the three dots icon and select **Unlink from Process**.
</Steps>

### Method 2: How do I link an existing one-off task?

<Steps>
1. First, [create a one-off task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-create-a-one-off-task-in-tallyfy/) with the necessary details (Name, Type, Description, Assignees, Deadline, etc.).
2. In the task creation panel for the one-off task, scroll down to the **Advanced** settings section.
3. Under **Link to Process**, select the active process you want to link this task to.
4. Choose the step in the active process that the new task should precede or follow.

5. Click **Create Task**.
6. The one-off task will now appear at the specified position in your active process.
7. To edit the task later, click the three dots icon next to it.
8. To remove the linked task, click the three dots icon and select **Unlink from Process**.
</Steps>

### What should I know about added tasks?
*   You can add as many tasks as you need - there's no limit.
*   Added tasks usually have a visual indicator (like "Linked to") so you know they weren't in the original template.
*   Here's the important part: adding tasks to a running process does **not** change your original template. The template stays exactly as it was.
