### Adding tasks mid-process

Tallyfy allows you to add [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to active [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) after they have been launched. This feature is useful when you need to add steps that were not initially included in the process.

Here's what you can add to your new task:

- Name
- Task Type
- Description
- Task [Assignees](/products/pro/documenting/members/)
- Task Deadline
- Position of the newly added task
- Advanced Options like requiring all assignees to complete the task or linking the task to the process

### How to add a task in an active process

There are two primary ways to add a new task to an already running process:

**Method 1: Adding directly within the process**

<Steps>
1. Open the active process where you want to add a task.
2. Scroll down to the bottom of the task list.
3. Enter a name for your new task in the **"Add task"** field.

4. Click the plus (+) icon or press Enter to add the basic task.
5. Click the newly added task to open its details panel.
6. Configure the task details (Type, Description, Assignees, Deadline, Advanced Options, Position) as needed.
7. Click **Save Changes** or close the details panel. The task is now part of the active process.
8. To edit the task later, click the three dots icon next to it.
9. To remove the linked task, click the three dots icon and select **Unlink from Process**.
</Steps>

**Method 2: Linking an existing one-off task**

<Steps>
1. First, [create a one-off task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-create-a-one-off-task-in-tallyfy/) with the necessary details (Name, Type, Description, Assignees, Deadline, etc.).
2. In the task creation panel for the one-off task, scroll down to the **Advanced** settings section.
3. Under **Link to Process**, select the active process you want to link this task to.
4. Choose the step in the active process that the new task should precede or follow.

5. Click **Create Task**.
6. The one-off task will now appear at the specified position in your active process.
7. To edit the task later, click the three dots icon next to it.
8. To remove the linked task, click the three dots icon and select **Unlink from Process**.
</Steps>

### Adding multiple tasks

You can add as many [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) as you'd like by following the above instructions. Each additional task will be marked as a "Linked to" task to help identify them. These tasks are only part of the specific process and will not be added to the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) unless you choose to do so.

import { CardGrid, LinkTitleCard} from "~/components";

## Adding Tasks to a Running Process (Ad-Hoc Tasks)

Sometimes you need to add an extra step to a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) *after* it has already started. Tallyfy lets you add these "ad-hoc" or one-off [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to specific running processes without changing the original [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).

When you add an ad-hoc task, you can set its:
*   Name
*   Type (Regular, Approval, Email, etc.)
*   Description
*   Assignee(s)
*   Deadline
*   Position in the workflow (where it should appear)
*   Advanced Options (e.g., require everyone assigned to complete it)

### How to add an ad-hoc task

There are two ways to add a task to a running process:

**Method 1: Add directly within the process view**

<Steps>
1. Open the running process you want to add a task to (usually from the **Tracker** view).
2. Scroll to the very bottom of the list of steps.
3. Type a name for your new task in the **Add task** box and press Enter or click the plus (+) icon.
   ![Add task box at the bottom of a running process](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-add-task-to-ongoing-process.png)
4. This adds a basic task. Click on the new task name to open its details panel.
5. Fill in the rest of the details (Type, Description, Assignee, Deadline, etc.) in the panel.
6. You can also change its **Position** relative to other tasks here.
7. Close the panel (changes usually save automatically).
8. To edit or remove the task later, click the menu icon (three dots) next to the task name and choose **Edit** or **Unlink from Process**.
</Steps>

**Method 2: Link an existing One-Off Task**

If you've already created a task separately (a "one-off task"), you can link it into a running process.

<Steps>
1. [Create the one-off task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-create-a-one-off-task-in-tallyfy/) first with all its details.
2. While creating or editing the one-off task, go to its **Advanced** settings section.
3. Find the **Link to Process** option.
4. Select the running process you want to add this task to from the dropdown list.
5. Choose where in that process the task should appear (e.g., before or after a specific existing step).
   ![Linking a one-off task to a process in Advanced settings](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-link-a-oneoff-task.png)
6. Save the one-off task.
7. The task will now appear in the selected running process.
8. You can edit or unlink it later using the menu icon (three dots) next to the task in the process view.
</Steps>

### Notes on Added Tasks

*   You can add multiple ad-hoc tasks to a process.
*   Tasks added this way are often marked visually (e.g., "Linked to") to show they weren't part of the original template.
*   Adding tasks to a running process does **not** change the original template.
