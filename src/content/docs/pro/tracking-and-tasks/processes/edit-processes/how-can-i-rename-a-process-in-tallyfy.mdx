## How to change the name of a process after launching it

Tallyfy allows you to change the title of an active process after it has been launched.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Go to your **Processes** view and open the process you want to rename.
2. Click on the current title.
3. The text will become editable. Type the new name and press **Enter** on your keyboard.
