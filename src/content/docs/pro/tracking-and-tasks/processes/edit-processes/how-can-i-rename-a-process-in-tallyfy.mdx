## How to change the name of a running process

You can easily rename a specific [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) run *after* it has been launched.

<Steps>
1. Find and open the running process you want to rename (e.g., from the **[Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** view).
2. Click directly on the current process name shown at the top of the process view.
3. The name will become an editable text box. Type the new name you want.
4. Press the **Enter** key on your keyboard to save the new name.
</Steps>
