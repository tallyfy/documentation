## How can I change the name of a running process?

Click directly on the process name at the top of any running [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) and type a new name - that's it. You can rename processes anytime after they're launched to keep things organized.

<Steps>
1. Find and open the running process you want to rename (from the **[Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** view works great).
2. Click directly on the current process name at the top of the process view.
3. The name becomes editable. Type your new name.
4. Press **Enter** to save.
</Steps>

Here's exactly where to click:
