## How to change the name of a process after launching it

What if you've already launched a process, but realize that the name just doesn't fit anymore? No problem! Tallyfy allows you to easily change the title of your active process.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Go to your _Processes_ view and open the process you want to rename.
2. Click on the current title, which you'll find right there on the screen.
3. The text will become editable. Just type in the new name and press _Enter_ on your keyboard. Voila!
