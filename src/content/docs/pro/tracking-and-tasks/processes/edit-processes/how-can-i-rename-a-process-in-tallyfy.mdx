## Change the name of a running process

Click the process name at the top of any running [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) to rename it. You can do this anytime after launch.

<Steps>
1. Open the running process you want to rename - the **[Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** view works great for finding it.
2. Click the process name at the top of the process view. A rename dialog opens.
3. Type your new name (up to 300 characters).
4. Click **Save**.
</Steps>

Here's where to click:
