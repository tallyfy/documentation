## Edit running processes

You can edit a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) after it's launched without touching your original template. Every change applies only to that specific run.

Here's what you can change:

*   Add one-off [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) that weren't in the template
*   Reassign tasks, adjust due dates, or update other task details
*   Rename the process instance
*   Archive or permanently delete the process when it's done

Your template stays untouched. Think of it like editing a copy of a document - the master version doesn't change while you customize the working copy.
