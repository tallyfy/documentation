### Modifying active processes

When a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) is launched and running - you can edit many aspects of it:

- You can add one-off or ad-hoc [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/)
- You can edit most properties of any [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), like [assignees](/products/pro/documenting/members/) and deadlines
- You can rename the process
- You can archive or delete the process
