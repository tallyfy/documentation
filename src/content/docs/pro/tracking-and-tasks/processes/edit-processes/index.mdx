## How can I edit running processes?

Even after a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) has been launched from a template, you can still make changes to that specific run. This allows you to adapt to changing circumstances without altering the original template. This flexibility ensures workflow adaptability while preserving template integrity.

Things you can typically edit in a running process include:

*   Adding extra one-off [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) that weren't in the template.
*   Changing details of existing [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), like who is assigned or when it's due.
*   Renaming the process instance.
*   Archiving or deleting the process run once it's no longer needed.

Explore the articles below to learn how to make these kinds of changes to your running processes.
