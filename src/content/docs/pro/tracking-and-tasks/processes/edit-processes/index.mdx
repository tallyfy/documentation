## How can I edit running processes?

Yes, you can edit a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) after it's launched - just make changes to that specific run without touching your original template. Need to add an unexpected task? Change who's assigned? Update a deadline? Done.

Here's what you can edit in a running process:

*   Add extra one-off [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) that weren't in the template (perfect for those "oh, we need to do this too" moments)
*   Change task details - reassign them, adjust due dates, whatever you need
*   Rename the process instance to something more specific
*   Archive or delete the process when you're finished with it

Your original template stays exactly as it was. Think of it like editing a copy of a document - the master version remains untouched while you customize the working copy for this particular situation.

The articles below show you exactly how to make these changes.
