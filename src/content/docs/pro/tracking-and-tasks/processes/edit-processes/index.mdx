## Editing running processes

Even after a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) has been launched from a template, you can still make changes to that specific run. This allows you to adapt to changing circumstances without altering the original template.

Things you can typically edit in a running process include:

*   Adding extra one-off [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) that weren't in the template.
*   Changing details of existing [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), like who is assigned or when it's due.
*   Renaming the process instance.
*   Archiving or deleting the process run once it's no longer needed.

Explore the articles below to learn how to make these kinds of changes to your running processes.
