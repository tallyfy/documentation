## How can I permanently delete an archived process?

You can't delete active or completed [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) in Tallyfy - you need to **archive them first**. Only then does the delete option appear.

Here's the thing: once you delete an archived process, it's gone forever. **There's no undo button.** Tallyfy makes you take these two steps on purpose - it stops you from accidentally wiping out important data.

<Steps>
1. Go to the **[Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** view using the left sidebar.
2. Click **Add filter** and choose the filter for **Status** is **Archived** (this shows only your archived processes).

3. Find the archived process you want to permanently delete in the list.
4. Click the **Delete** button (look for the trash can icon üóëÔ∏è) next to that process.
5. Confirm that you really want to delete it permanently.
</Steps>
