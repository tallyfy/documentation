## Permanently delete an archived process

You can't delete active or completed [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) in Tallyfy directly. You must **archive them first** - only then does the delete option appear.

Once deleted, the process and all its data are gone forever. **There's no undo.** Tallyfy enforces this two-step flow to prevent accidental data loss.

:::caution
Only **Admin** users can permanently delete processes. Standard and Light members won't see the delete option.
:::

<Steps>
1. Open the **[Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** view from the left sidebar.
2. Click **Add filter** and set **Status** to **Archived**.

3. Find the archived process you want to delete.
4. Click the **Delete** button next to that process.
5. Confirm permanent deletion in the dialog that appears.
