## How can I permanently delete an archived process?

In Tallyfy, you cannot directly delete an active or completed [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). You must **first archive** the process before deletion becomes available.

Once a process is archived, you can then permanently delete it. **Warning: Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone.** This two-step approach prevents accidental data loss and ensures deliberate process removal.

<Steps>
1. Go to the **[Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** view using the left sidebar.
2. Click **Add filter** and choose the filter for **Status** is **Archived** (or similar wording to show only archived processes).

3. Find the archived process you want to permanently delete in the list.
4. Click the **Delete** button (often a trash can icon üóëÔ∏è) for that process.
5. Confirm that you want to permanently delete the process.
</Steps>
