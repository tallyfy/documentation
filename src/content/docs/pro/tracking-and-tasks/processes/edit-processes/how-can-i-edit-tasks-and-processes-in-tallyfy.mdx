## How can I edit the properties of a running process?

Even after a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) has started, you can often change some of its overall settings and information. This flexibility enables adaptation to changing requirements without restarting workflows.

### How do I access Process Settings?

<Steps>
1. Open the running process you want to edit (usually from the **Tracker** view).
2. Click the **Settings** button (gear icon ⚙️) in the top-right corner of the process view.

3. This opens the process settings panel, usually starting on the **Summary** tab.
</Steps>

### What properties can I edit in a running process?

From the process settings panel (mainly the Summary tab), you can usually change:

*   **Process Name**: Click the name at the top to rename this specific process run.
*   **Process Owner**: Change who is responsible for the overall process. Click the edit icon next to the owner's name.

*   **Process Deadline**: Change the overall due date for the entire process.
*   **Tags**: Add or remove tags to help categorize this running process.
*   **Process Folder**: Move this process into a different folder (in your Tracker/Tasks view).
*   **Process Notes**: Add general notes about this specific run of the process.

You can also usually *view* (but not edit) other information here, like:
*   The original [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) description.
*   Answers given in the [kick-off form](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/).

### What other process actions are available?

At the bottom of the process settings panel, you can also usually find buttons to:

*   **Archive Process**: Hide the process from active views (must be done before deleting).
*   **Export CSV**: Download all process data.
*   **Delete Process**: Permanently delete the process (only appears if the process is already archived).

:::note[What permissions do I need to edit processes?]
Your ability to edit these properties might depend on your role (Administrator or Standard member) and whether you are the process owner. Different roles have varying levels of access to process modification features.
:::

### When should I edit process properties?

*   When someone else needs to take over ownership of the process.
*   If the goal or details of this specific run have changed slightly.
*   To add important notes specific to this run.
*   To better organize running processes using tags or folders.
*   If the overall timeline needs adjustment.

### What are best practices for editing processes?

*   Let people involved know if you make significant changes (like changing the owner or deadline).
*   Use tags consistently across your organization.
*   Use the Notes section to explain major changes or context specific to this run.
