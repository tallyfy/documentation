## How to edit the properties of a running process

Even after a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) has started, you can often change some of its overall settings and information.

### How to access Process Settings

<Steps>
1. Open the running process you want to edit (usually from the **Tracker** view).
2. Click the **Settings** button (gear icon ⚙️) in the top-right corner of the process view.

3. This opens the process settings panel, usually starting on the **Summary** tab.
</Steps>

### What properties can you edit?

From the process settings panel (mainly the Summary tab), you can usually change:

*   **Process Name**: Click the name at the top to rename this specific process run.
*   **Process Owner**: Change who is responsible for the overall process. Click the edit icon next to the owner's name.

*   **Process Deadline**: Change the overall due date for the entire process.
*   **Tags**: Add or remove tags to help categorize this running process.
*   **Process Folder**: Move this process into a different folder (in your Tracker/Tasks view).
*   **Process Notes**: Add general notes about this specific run of the process.

You can also usually *view* (but not edit) other information here, like:
*   The original [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) description.
*   Answers given in the [kick-off form](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/).

### Other Process Actions (Archive/Export/Delete)

At the bottom of the process settings panel, you can also usually find buttons to:

*   **Archive Process**: Hide the process from active views (must be done before deleting).
*   **Export CSV**: Download all process data.
*   **Delete Process**: Permanently delete the process (only appears if the process is already archived).

:::note[Permissions Needed]
Your ability to edit these properties might depend on your role (Administrator or Standard member) and whether you are the process owner.
:::

### When might you edit process properties?

*   When someone else needs to take over ownership of the process.
*   If the goal or details of this specific run have changed slightly.
*   To add important notes specific to this run.
*   To better organize running processes using tags or folders.
*   If the overall timeline needs adjustment.

### Tips for editing processes

*   Let people involved know if you make significant changes (like changing the owner or deadline).
*   Use tags consistently.
*   Use the Notes section to explain major changes or context specific to this run.
