### Editable process properties

#### Basic information

- **Process name**: Click directly on the process name at the top to edit it
- **Process owner**: Click the edit icon next to the current owner and select a new owner

- **Process start date**: Adjust when the process officially began
- **Process deadline**: Set or modify the overall process due date

#### Organization and metadata

- **Tags**: Add, edit, or remove tags to categorize your process
- **Process folders**: Move the process to different organizational folders
- **Process notes**: Add important context or instructions for the entire process

#### Documentation

- **Template description**: View the description from the original template
- **Process instructions**: Review guidance for process execution
- **Kick-off form fields**: Access form data collected at process initiation

### Process management options

At the bottom of the Summary tab, you'll find process management actions:

- **Archive process**: Temporarily hide a completed process from active views
- **Export CSV**: Download all process data in CSV format for analysis
- **Delete process**: Permanently remove a process (only available for archived processes)

### When to edit process properties

Consider editing process properties when:
- Responsibility needs to transfer to a different owner
- The process scope or purpose has changed
- Additional context is needed for team members
- The process needs better organization through updated tags or folders
- Process timelines require adjustment

### Best practices for process editing

- Communicate changes to all stakeholders involved in the process
- Update tags consistently to maintain proper categorization
- Add notes when making significant changes to document the reasoning
- Review all settings periodically to ensure accuracy
