2. Click the **Settings** button in the top-right corner of the process view

</Steps>

### Editable Process properties

From the Summary tab, you can modify various aspects of your process:

#### Basic information

- **Process name**: Click directly on the process name at the top to edit it
- **[Process owner](/products/pro/documenting/members/)**: Click the edit icon next to the current owner and select a new owner
  ![Change process owner](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-change-process-owner.png)
- **Process start date**: Adjust when the process officially began
- **Process deadline**: Set or modify the overall process due date

#### Organization and metadata

- **Tags**: Add, edit, or remove tags to categorize your process
- **Process folders**: Move the process to different organizational folders
- **Process notes**: Add important context or instructions for the entire process

#### Documentation

- **[Template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) description**: View the description from the original template
- **Process instructions**: Review guidance for process execution
- **[Kick-off form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/)**: Access form data collected at process initiation

### Process management options

At the bottom of the Summary tab, you'll find process management actions:

- **Archive process**: Temporarily hide a completed process from active views
- **Export CSV**: Download all process data in CSV format for analysis
- **Delete process**: Permanently remove a process (only available for archived processes)

:::note[Permission requirements]
Some editing options may be limited based on your user permissions. Process owners and administrators typically have full editing capabilities.

### When to edit Process properties

Consider editing process properties when:
- Responsibility needs to transfer to a different owner
- The process scope or purpose has changed
- Additional context is needed for [team members](/products/pro/documenting/members/)
- The process needs better organization through updated tags or folders
- Process timelines require adjustment

### Best practices for Process editing

- Communicate changes to all stakeholders involved in the process
- Update tags consistently to maintain proper categorization
- Add notes when making significant changes to document the reasoning
- Review all settings periodically to ensure accuracy
