## Edit running process properties

You can change process settings after a process is running. Open the process and click **Settings** - no need to start over.

### How do I access process settings?

<Steps>
1. Open the running process from the **Tracker** view.
2. Click the **Settings** button (gear icon) in the top-right corner.

3. The settings panel opens on the **Summary** tab.
</Steps>

### What can I edit in the settings panel?

The Summary tab lets you change:

*   **Process Name** - click the name at the top and type a new one. Hit Enter to save.
*   **Process Owner** - click the pencil icon next to the owner's name to reassign.

*   **Process Notes** - add context about this specific run using the rich text editor.

The panel also shows read-only info:
*   Tasks completed count, creator, and start date
*   The original [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) description
*   Answers from the [kick-off form](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/)

Tags and folders for a process are managed from the process card in the **Tracker** view, not from this settings panel.

### What other process actions are available?

You can **Export CSV** to download all process data. The settings panel also has **Permissions** and **Activity** tabs.

:::note[Where can I archive a process?]
The archive option is in the **Tracker view** - click the three-dot menu (...) on a process card. See [how to archive and unarchive processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/organize-processes/how-to-archive-and-unarchive-processes-in-tallyfy/) for details.

:::note[What permissions do I need to edit processes?]
Administrators can edit everything. Standard members may have restrictions. Process owners get more control over their own processes.
