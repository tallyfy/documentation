## How can I edit the properties of a running process?

You can change process settings even after they're running - just open the process and click the **Settings** button. Perfect for when plans change mid-workflow. No need to start over.

### How do I access process settings?

<Steps>
1. Open the running process you want to edit (you'll find it in the **Tracker** view).
2. Click the **Settings** button (gear icon ⚙️) in the top-right corner.

3. The settings panel opens - you'll land on the **Summary** tab.
</Steps>

### What properties can I edit in a running process?

Once you're in the settings panel (it opens on the Summary tab), here's what you can change:

*   **Process Name**: Click the name at the top and type a new one. Simple.
*   **Process Owner**: Need someone else to take over? Click the edit icon next to the owner's name.

*   **Process Deadline**: Adjust the overall due date when timelines shift.
*   **Tags**: Add tags to categorize and find this process later. Really helpful when you're juggling multiple workflows.
*   **Process Folder**: Move it to a different folder in your Tracker or Tasks view - keeps everything organized.
*   **Process Notes**: Add notes about this specific run. Great for context that doesn't fit anywhere else.

You'll also see (but can't edit) a few things:
*   The original [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) description
*   Answers from the [kick-off form](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/)

### What other process actions are available?

Look at the bottom of the settings panel - you'll find an **Export CSV** button to download all your process data.

:::note[Where can I archive a process?]
The archive option is available in the **Tracker view** by clicking the three-dot menu (...) on a process card. See [how to archive and unarchive processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/organize-processes/how-to-archive-and-unarchive-processes-in-tallyfy/) for detailed instructions.

:::note[What permissions do I need to edit processes?]
Your editing options depend on your role - Administrators can edit everything, while Standard members might have some restrictions. Process owners typically get more control over their own processes.

### When should I edit process properties?

Here's when you'll typically need to make changes:

*   Someone else needs to take ownership (vacation, reassignment, etc.)
*   Plans changed mid-workflow and you need to adjust details
*   You want to add notes about what's happening in this specific run
*   Your process list is getting messy - time to reorganize with tags or folders
*   That deadline isn't looking so realistic anymore

### What are best practices for editing processes?

A few tips to keep things running smoothly:

*   Tell your team when you make big changes - especially new owners or deadlines. Nobody likes surprises.
*   Keep your tags consistent. If you use "Q4-Planning" in one place, don't use "Q4 Planning" somewhere else.
*   Drop a note in the Notes section when you make major changes. Future you will thank present you.
