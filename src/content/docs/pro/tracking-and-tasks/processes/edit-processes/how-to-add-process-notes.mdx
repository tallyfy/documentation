## How do process notes work in Tallyfy?

Process notes provide a centralized location for critical information, files, and links relevant to a specific [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) run. They remain visible to everyone involved in the process and appear prominently in both the process overview and each individual [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/). This comprehensive visibility ensures consistent information access throughout the entire workflow.

### Why should I use process notes in Tallyfy?

- **Provide essential context**: Add crucial background information that helps team members understand this specific process run
- **Maintain information visibility**: Notes appear consistently on every task, ensuring participants always have access to them
- **Centralize critical details**: All process-specific information remains organized in one accessible location
- **Share resources efficiently**: Attach relevant documents and links that apply to the entire process workflow

### How do I add or edit process notes in Tallyfy?

<Steps>
1. Open the running [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) where you want to add or modify notes.
2. Click the **Settings** button (gear icon ⚙️) located in the top-right corner of the process view.

### Where do process notes appear in Tallyfy?

Process notes appear in two strategic locations:

1. **In the process settings**: Under the Settings > Summary tab of the process for centralized management
2. **On each individual task**: Notes are visible in the "Process Details" section of every task in the process, ensuring all participants see identical information regardless of which specific task they're working on

### What should I include in effective process notes?

Well-crafted process notes typically include:

- **Essential context**: Explain why this specific process is being executed or document any special circumstances
- **Resource links**: URLs to related resources, documents, or external systems that participants need
- **Critical files**: Attachments required throughout the entire process workflow
- **Key contacts**: Names and contact information for important stakeholders not directly participating in the process
- **Special instructions**: Any unusual requirements or exceptions for this particular process run
- **Real-time updates**: New information that emerges during process execution

### What are best practices for writing effective process notes?

- **Maintain conciseness**: Notes appear on every task, so avoid unnecessarily lengthy text that could overwhelm users
- **Format for optimal readability**: Use formatting options like bold text and bullet points to enhance clarity
- **Update proactively**: Add new relevant information as the process progresses and circumstances change
- **Avoid unnecessary duplication**: Don't repeat information that's already clearly stated in task descriptions
- **Consider universal visibility**: Remember that notes are visible to everyone involved in the process, so write appropriately
