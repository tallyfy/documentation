## How do process notes work in Tallyfy?

Process notes in Tallyfy give you a single place to store important information, files, and links for a specific [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) run. Everyone involved can see them - they show up in the process overview and on each individual [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/). Simple. This way, nobody misses critical information no matter which task they're working on.

### Why should I use process notes in Tallyfy?

- **Provide essential context**: Add background info that helps your team understand what's special about this process run
- **Maintain information visibility**: Notes show up on every task - participants can't miss them
- **Centralize critical details**: Keep all process-specific information in one spot (no more hunting through emails)
- **Share resources efficiently**: Attach documents and links once, and they're available throughout the workflow

### How do I add or edit process notes in Tallyfy?

<Steps>
1. Open the running [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) where you want to add or modify notes.
2. Click the **Settings** button (gear icon ⚙️) in the top-right corner of the process view.

5. Your notes save automatically as you type - no need to hit a save button.

### Where do process notes appear in Tallyfy?

You'll find process notes in two key places:

1. **In the process settings**: Look under Settings > Summary tab for centralized management
2. **On each individual task**: They show up in the "Process Details" section of every task - this means everyone sees the same information, no matter which task they're on

### What should I include in effective process notes?

Here's what makes process notes actually useful:

- **Essential context**: Why are we running this process? Document any special circumstances that matter
- **Resource links**: Drop in URLs to documents, systems, or tools people will need
- **Critical files**: Attach files that everyone needs access to throughout the workflow
- **Key contacts**: List stakeholders who aren't in the process but might need to be reached
- **Special instructions**: Flag any exceptions or unusual requirements for this specific run
- **Real-time updates**: Add new information as it comes up during execution

### What are best practices for writing effective process notes?

- **Keep it brief**: These notes appear on every single task - don't overwhelm people with walls of text
- **Format for clarity**: Use bold text and bullet points to make information easy to scan
- **Update as you go**: Things change? Add new info as the process moves forward
- **Don't repeat yourself**: If it's already in the task description, skip it in the notes
- **Write for everyone**: Remember - all participants can see these notes, so keep them professional
