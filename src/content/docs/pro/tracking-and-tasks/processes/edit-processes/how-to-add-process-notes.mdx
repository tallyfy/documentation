## Working with process notes in Tallyfy

Process notes provide a dedicated place for important information, files, and links relevant to a specific [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) run. They're visible to everyone involved in the process and appear in both the process overview and each individual [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/).

### Why use process notes?

- **Provide context**: Add background information that helps people understand this specific process run.
- **Keep information visible**: Notes appear on every task, so participants always see them.
- **Centralize important details**: All process-specific information stays in one place.
- **Share files and links**: Attach relevant documents and resources that apply to the whole process.

### Adding or editing process notes

<Steps>
1. Open the running [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) where you want to add notes.
2. Click the **Settings** button (gear icon ⚙️) in the top-right corner of the process view.

3. In the panel that opens, scroll down to the **Process Notes** section.
4. Enter your information, links, or upload files in the text editor.
5. The notes are saved automatically as you type.
</Steps>

:::note[Who can add process notes?]
Process notes can typically be added or edited by the process owner, administrators, and in some cases standard members with appropriate permissions.

### Where process notes appear

Process notes appear in two main places:

1. **In the process settings**: Under the Settings > Summary tab of the process.
2. **On each task**: Notes are visible in the "Process Details" section of every task in the process, ensuring all participants see the same information regardless of which task they're working on.

### What to include in process notes

Good process notes often include:

- **Context**: Why this specific process is being run or any special circumstances.
- **Links**: URLs to related resources, documents, or external systems.
- **Files**: Attachments needed throughout the process.
- **Key contacts**: Names of important stakeholders not directly in the process.
- **Special instructions**: Any unusual requirements for this particular run.
- **Updates**: New information that emerges during the process.

### Tips for effective process notes

- **Keep them concise**: Notes appear on every task, so avoid lengthy text.
- **Format for readability**: Use formatting options like bold and bullet points.
- **Update as needed**: Add new information as the process progresses.
- **Don't duplicate**: Avoid repeating information that's already in task descriptions.
- **Consider visibility**: Remember that notes are visible to everyone involved in the process.
