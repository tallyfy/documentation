## How do process notes work in Tallyfy?

Process notes let you add rich text to a running [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). They're visible in the process settings and on every [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in the **Process Details** section - so nobody misses key context regardless of which task they're working on.

- **Add context** - background info about what's special about this run
- **Keep everyone aligned** - notes show on every task automatically
- **One place for details** - no more hunting through emails or chat threads

### How do I add or edit process notes?

<Steps>
1. Open the running [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) you want to add notes to.
2. Click the **Settings** button (gear icon) in the top-right corner.

3. In the **Summary** tab, find the **Process Notes** section.
4. Type your notes using the rich text editor - you can format text, add links, and embed content.
5. Click **Save** to store your changes.
</Steps>

### Where do process notes appear?

1. **Process settings** - in the **Summary** tab where you edit them
2. **Every task** - in the collapsible **Process Details** section, so all participants see the same info

### What to include in process notes

- **Context** - why you're running this process and any special circumstances
- **Links** - URLs to documents, systems, or tools people need
- **Contacts** - people who aren't in the process but might need to be reached
- **Exceptions** - any unusual requirements for this specific run
- **Updates** - add new info as it comes up during the process

### Tips for writing good process notes

- **Keep it short** - notes show on every task, so don't write walls of text
- **Use formatting** - bold text and bullet points make notes scannable
- **Skip duplicates** - if it's already in a task description, don't repeat it in notes
