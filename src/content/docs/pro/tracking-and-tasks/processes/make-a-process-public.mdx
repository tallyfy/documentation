## How can I make a process visible to outsiders (Public Link)?

:::note[Why is this an admin-only feature?]
For security reasons, only Tallyfy users with the **Administrator** [role](/products/pro/documenting/members/) can make a running process publicly accessible. This restriction protects sensitive organizational information and ensures controlled access to critical workflows.
:::

Sometimes, you might need to share the current status of a specific running [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) with external stakeholders (who aren't Tallyfy users or registered guests). Tallyfy provides a secure option to generate a **public, read-only link** for any specific process. This powerful feature enables transparent communication with external stakeholders while maintaining security.

Anyone with this generated link can view the real-time progress of the process, but they **cannot** make any modifications or changes. The public link provides complete visibility without compromising security or workflow integrity.

### How do I get the public link for a process?

<Steps>
1. Navigate to your **[Tracker view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** and open the specific running process you want to share publicly.
2. Click the **Settings** button for that process (typically a gear icon ⚙️ located in the top right corner).
3. In the settings panel that opens, navigate to the **Permissions** section.
4. Locate the setting labeled **Public to the world** and toggle it to **Yes**.
5. You might see additional options appear allowing you to choose exactly *what* parts of the process are visible on the public link (e.g., comments, form data). Select these options carefully based on what information you want to share externally.
6. After enabling public access, locate and copy the automatically generated public link (it will appear in the same Permissions section).

:::caution[What are the security implications of public links?]
Exercise extreme caution when using this feature. **Anyone** who obtains this link can view the process details you've chosen to make visible. This might include sensitive task status information, internal comments, form field answers, and assignee names.

If you only need specific external people to complete *certain tasks*, it's significantly more secure to add them as [guests to those specific steps](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-can-i-assign-tasks-to-guest-users-in-tallyfy/) instead of making the entire process publicly accessible. Guest access provides superior control and enhanced security.
:::

Once you have generated the public link, you can share it with anyone who requires read-only visibility into that specific process run. This powerful sharing capability facilitates transparent communication with external stakeholders while maintaining operational control.
