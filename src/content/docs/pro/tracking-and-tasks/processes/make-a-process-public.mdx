## Enabling the public process link

:::note[Admin only]

For security reasons, this feature is only available to admin users in your company. This ensures every process remains confidential unless it's required to be shared in a read-only manner.

:::

Sometimes, you'll need a way to share the state of a process with someone outside of your company. To achieve this. Tallyfy gives you access to a public link that displays a **READ-ONLY** version of your process that can be accessed by anyone with the link.

You can get this link by making your process **Public**:

1. Open your Tracker view and select the process you want to share.
2. Click on **Settings**.
3. Select the **permissions** section.
4. Select **Public to the world** and mark it as **yes**
5. You'll get multiple options regarding what is visible. Choose the ones that fit your needs the best.

:::caution[Everything will be public]

It is important to note that **everything** will be completely visible to anyone with the link. This includes the state of any form fields, assignees' names, and the progress made on the entire process. If you want to restrict access to certain people outside your organization instead of anyone with the generated link, consider adding [guests to specific steps](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-can-i-assign-tasks-to-guest-users-in-tallyfy/) instead.

:::

You'll get a link that you can share with anyone you want to give access to the process. They will be able to access the **Steps** and **View** sections of your process, but they won't be able to make any changes to it.
