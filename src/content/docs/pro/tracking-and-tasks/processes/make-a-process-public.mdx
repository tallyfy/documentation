## Enabling the public process link

:::note[Admin only]

For security reasons, this feature is only available to [admin users](/products/pro/documenting/members/) in your company. This ensures every process remains confidential unless it's required to be shared in a read-only manner.

:::

Sometimes, you'll need a way to share the state of a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) with someone outside of your company. To achieve this. Tallyfy gives you access to a public link that displays a **READ-ONLY** version of your process that can be accessed by anyone with the link.

You can get this link by making your process **Public**:

<Steps>
1. Open your [Tracker view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/) and select the process you want to share.
2. Click on **Settings**.
3. Select the **permissions** section.
4. Select **Public to the world** and mark it as **yes**
5. You'll get multiple options regarding what is visible. Choose the ones that fit your needs the best.

</Steps>

:::caution[Everything will be public]

It is important to note that **everything** will be completely visible to anyone with the link. This includes the state of any [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/), [assignees](/products/pro/documenting/members/)' names, and the progress made on the entire process. If you want to restrict access to certain people outside your organization instead of anyone with the generated link, consider adding [guests to specific steps](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-can-i-assign-tasks-to-guest-users-in-tallyfy/) instead.

:::

You'll get a link that you can share with anyone you want to give access to the process. They will be able to access the **Steps** and **View** sections of your process, but they won't be able to make any changes to it.
