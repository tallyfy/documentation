## Making a process visible to outsiders (Public Link)

:::note[Admin Only Feature]
For security, only Tallyfy users with the **Administrator** [role](/products/pro/documenting/members/) can make a running process public.
:::

Sometimes, you might want to share the status of a specific running [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) with someone outside your company (who isn't a Tallyfy user or guest). Tallyfy provides an option to generate a **public, read-only link** for a specific process.

Anyone with this link can view the progress of the process, but they **cannot** make any changes.

### How to get the public link for a process

<Steps>
1. Go to your **[Tracker view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** and open the specific running process you want to share.
2. Click the **Settings** button for that process (usually a gear icon ⚙️ in the top right).
3. In the settings panel, go to the **Permissions** section.
4. Find the setting **Public to the world** and switch it to **Yes**.
5. You might see some options appear allowing you to choose *what* parts of the process are visible on the public link (e.g., comments, form data). Select the options carefully based on what you want to share.
6. After enabling public access, find and copy the generated public link (it might appear in the same Permissions section).

</Steps>

:::caution[Public means PUBLIC!]
Be very careful when using this feature. **Anyone** who gets this link can see the process details you've chosen to make visible. This might include task status, comments, form field answers, and assignee names.

If you only need specific external people to complete *certain tasks*, it's much more secure to add them as [guests to those specific steps](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-can-i-assign-tasks-to-guest-users-in-tallyfy/) instead of making the whole process public.
:::

Once you have the public link, you can share it with anyone who needs read-only visibility into that specific process run.
