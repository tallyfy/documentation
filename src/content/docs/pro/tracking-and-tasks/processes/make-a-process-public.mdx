## Make a process visible to outsiders

:::note[Who can do this?]
The **Permissions** tab on a running process is visible to **Administrators**, **process owners**, and the **person who started the process**. Only these [roles](/products/pro/documenting/members/) can toggle the public setting.
:::

You can generate a read-only public link to any running process. Anyone with the link can view progress in real-time - no Tallyfy account needed. They can't change anything.

### How do I get the public link for a process?

<Steps>
1. Open the running process from your **[Tracker view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)**.
2. Click the **Settings** button (gear icon in the top-right corner).
3. Go to the **Permissions** tab.
4. Find **Public to the world** and toggle it to **Yes**.
5. Three visibility toggles appear - choose what's shown on the public link:
   - **Comments** - show or hide task comments
   - **Form fields** - show or hide form field data
   - **Assignees** - show or hide who's assigned to each task
6. Copy the generated public link from the same Permissions section.

</Steps>

:::caution[Security implications]
**Anyone** with this link can view the process details you've chosen to expose - task statuses, comments, form field answers, and assignee names depending on your visibility toggles.

If you only need specific external people to complete certain tasks, it's safer to add them as [guests to those steps](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-can-i-assign-tasks-to-guest-users-in-tallyfy/) instead.
:::

### How does the public setting affect guest visibility?

Making a process public also changes what your [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) can see in the [Tracker view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/):

- **Private process** (default) - guests only see their own assigned tasks
- **Public process** - guests can see **all tasks** in the process, even ones they're not assigned to

:::warning[Guest visibility when public]
With a public process, every guest assigned to any task can see all tasks in the workflow:
- Tasks assigned to other guests or vendors
- Internal company tasks
- Form field data, comments, and file attachments

If multiple external vendors work on different parts of a project, they'll all see each other's tasks and your internal work. That's great for transparency - but not always what you want.
:::

The [Tasks view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/) works differently. Guests still only see their own assigned tasks there, regardless of the public setting.

:::warning[Guest privacy]
If your process has tasks assigned to different external guests who shouldn't see each other's work, keep the process private.
