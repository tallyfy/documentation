## How can I make a process visible to outsiders (Public Link)?

:::note[Why is this an admin-only feature?]
For security reasons, only Tallyfy users with the **Administrator** [role](/products/pro/documenting/members/) can make a running process publicly accessible. This restriction protects sensitive organizational information and ensures controlled access to critical workflows.
:::

Need to share process updates with a client who doesn't have Tallyfy access? Simple. Generate a public link - anyone with it can view your process in real-time without making changes. Perfect for keeping external stakeholders in the loop.

You might use this when you're managing a project for a client and they want visibility into progress. Or maybe you're working with a partner company and need to share workflow status. Tallyfy's secure public links give you that transparency without the security headaches. Your stakeholders see exactly what's happening (comments, tasks, progress - whatever you choose to share), but they can't modify anything. 

Here's the thing: it's all read-only. Complete visibility, zero risk.

### How do I get the public link for a process?

<Steps>
1. Navigate to your **[Tracker view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)** and open the specific running process you want to share publicly.
2. Click the **Settings** button for that process (typically a gear icon ⚙️ located in the top right corner).
3. In the settings panel that opens, navigate to the **Permissions** section.
4. Locate the setting labeled **Public to the world** and toggle it to **Yes**.
5. You might see additional options appear allowing you to choose exactly *what* parts of the process are visible on the public link (e.g., comments, form data). Select these options carefully based on what information you want to share externally.
6. After enabling public access, locate and copy the automatically generated public link (it will appear in the same Permissions section).

:::caution[What are the security implications of public links?]
Exercise extreme caution when using this feature. **Anyone** who obtains this link can view the process details you've chosen to make visible. This might include sensitive task status information, internal comments, form field answers, and assignee names.

If you only need specific external people to complete *certain tasks*, it's significantly more secure to add them as [guests to those specific steps](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-can-i-assign-tasks-to-guest-users-in-tallyfy/) instead of making the entire process publicly accessible. Guest access provides superior control and enhanced security.
:::

### How does the public setting affect guest visibility?

Here's where it gets interesting. Making a process public doesn't just create a shareable link - it changes what your [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) can see too.

When you flip that **Public to the world** switch to **Yes**, your guests suddenly get a much wider view in the [Tracker view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/):

- **Private process** (default): Guests only see their own tasks. That's it.
- **Public process**: Guests can see **ALL tasks** in the entire process - even ones they're not assigned to

:::warning[Critical security consideration]
When you make a process public, ALL guests assigned to ANY task in that process can see EVERY task in the workflow, including:
- Tasks assigned to other guests/vendors
- Internal company tasks
- All form field data entered
- All comments and discussions
- File attachments

Think about that for a second. If you've got multiple external vendors working on different parts of a project, making it public means they'll all see each other's tasks AND your internal work. Sometimes that's exactly what you want (transparency breeds accountability). Sometimes it's definitely not.
:::

The [Tasks view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/)? Different story. Guests still only see their assigned tasks there, public or not.

:::warning[Important consideration for guest privacy]
If your process contains tasks assigned to different external guests who shouldn't see each other's work, keep the process private. Public processes are best suited for situations where full transparency is desired among all participants.
:::

Got your public link? Share it with anyone who needs to see what's happening. Your client gets real-time updates, you maintain control - everyone wins.
