## Add, edit, and delete comments on processes

Comments on a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) are for discussions about the overall workflow - not individual [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/). Anyone who can view the process can typically see and add comments.

### How do I add a comment?

<Steps>
1. Open the running process you want to comment on.
2. Find the **Comments** section.
3. Type your message in the comment box.
4. Click **Post**.
5. Your comment appears with your name and timestamp.
</Steps>

### How do I @mention people?

Type `@` followed by someone's name to notify them directly.

<Steps>
1. While typing your comment, type the `@` symbol.
2. Start typing the person's name.
3. Select the correct person from the dropdown.
4. Click **Post**.
</Steps>

The mentioned person gets a notification. @mentioning someone on a task can also auto-assign them if they don't already have access.

### How do I edit a comment?

<Steps>
1. Find your comment in the list.
2. Click the **Edit** button (pencil icon) on your comment.
3. Change the text.
4. Click **Save**.
</Steps>

You can only edit your own comments. Organization admins can edit any comment.

### How do I delete a comment?

<Steps>
1. Find your comment.
2. Click the **Delete** button (trash icon) on your comment.
3. Confirm the deletion.
</Steps>

Deleted comments are permanently removed. Like editing, only the comment author or an organization admin can delete a comment.

### Process comments vs. task comments

- **Process comments** - general discussion about the whole workflow, visible in the main process view.
- **[Task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) comments** - questions or updates about a specific task, visible only when you open that task.

### Comment history

All comments are saved with the process as a permanent record. This helps when reviewing past decisions or onboarding new team members.

### Do template comments carry over?

No. Comments on a template stay with the template - they don't appear when you launch a process from it. Template comments are for design discussions; process comments are for the actual running work.
