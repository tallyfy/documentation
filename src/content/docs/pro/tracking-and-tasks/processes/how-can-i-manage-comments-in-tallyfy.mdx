## How to add, edit, and delete comments on processes

Process comments are for discussions about the *overall* [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), rather than specific [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) within it. Anyone who can view the process can usually see and add process comments.

### Adding comments to a process

<Steps>
1. Open the running process you want to comment on.
2. Scroll down to the bottom where you see the **Comments** section.
3. Type your message in the comment box.
4. Click **Post**.
5. Your comment appears in the list with your name and the time.
</Steps>

### Mentioning people (@mentions)

To make sure a specific person sees your comment, you can @mention them:

<Steps>
1. When typing your comment, type the `@` symbol.
2. Start typing the person's name.
3. Select the correct person from the list that appears.
4. Finish typing your comment and click **Post**.
5. The person you mentioned will get a notification.
</Steps>

### Editing your own process comments

If you made a mistake in a comment you posted:

<Steps>
1. Find your comment in the list.
2. Click the **Edit** button (pencil icon ‚úèÔ∏è) on your comment.
3. Change the text.
4. Click **Save**.
</Steps>

### Deleting your process comments

If you need to remove a comment you posted:

<Steps>
1. Find your comment.
2. Click the **Delete** button (trash can icon üóëÔ∏è) on your comment.
3. Confirm that you want to delete it.
4. The comment will be permanently removed.
</Steps>

### Process Comments vs. Task Comments

*   **Process comments**: For general discussion about the whole workflow. Visible at the bottom of the main process view.
*   **[Task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) comments**: For questions or updates about a *specific task*. Visible only when you open that task.

Use process comments for overall updates, and task comments for task-specific details.

### Comment History

All process comments are saved with the process, creating a history of the discussion. This can be useful for understanding past decisions or getting new team members up to speed.
