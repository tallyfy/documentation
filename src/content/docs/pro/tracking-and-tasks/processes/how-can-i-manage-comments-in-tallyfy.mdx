## How to add, edit, and delete comments in processes

Process comments allow [team members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) to discuss, ask questions, and provide updates about the overall [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) rather than individual [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/). This guide covers how to effectively use comments in Tallyfy processes.

### Adding process comments

<Steps>
1. Open the process you want to comment on
2. Scroll down to the **Comments** section at the bottom of the process view
3. Click in the comment field
4. Type your message or question
5. Click **Post** to publish your comment
6. Your comment will appear in the comments thread with your name and timestamp
</Steps>

### Using @mentions

To notify specific [team members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) in your comment:

<Steps>
1. Type the @ symbol in your comment
2. Begin typing the name of the team member
3. Select the correct person from the dropdown list that appears
4. Finish your comment and click **Post**
5. The mentioned user will receive a notification about your comment
</Steps>

### Editing your process comments

To modify a comment you've already posted:

<Steps>
1. Locate your comment in the process comments section
2. Click the **Edit** button (pencil icon) in the top-right corner of your comment
3. Make your changes in the edit field
4. Click **Save** to update your comment
</Steps>

### Deleting process comments

If a comment is no longer needed:

<Steps>
1. Find your comment in the process comments section
2. Click the **Delete** button (trash icon) in the top-right corner
3. Confirm the deletion when prompted
4. The comment will be permanently removed from the process
</Steps>

### Process comments vs. task comments

- **Process comments** are visible to anyone with access to the [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) and appear at the process level
- **[Task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) comments** are specific to individual tasks and appear only in the task view
- Use process comments for discussions about the entire process workflow
- Use task comments for discussions about specific task requirements or issues

### Viewing comment history

All process comments are preserved in chronological order, creating a complete record of discussions and decisions related to the [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). This history is valuable for:

- Onboarding new [team members](/products/pro/documenting/members/)
- Auditing process changes
- Understanding decision context
- Tracking process improvements over time
