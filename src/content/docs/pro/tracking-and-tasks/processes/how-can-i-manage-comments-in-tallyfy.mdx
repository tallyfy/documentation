## How can I add, edit, and delete comments on processes?

Tallyfy process comments are for discussions about the *overall* [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), rather than specific [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) within it. Anyone who can view the process can usually see and add process comments. This communication approach maintains clear separation between process-level and task-level discussions.

### How do I add comments to a process?

<Steps>
1. Open the running process you want to comment on.
2. Scroll down to the bottom where you see the **Comments** section.
3. Type your message in the comment box.
4. Click **Post**.
5. Your comment appears in the list with your name and the time.
</Steps>

### How do I mention people in comments (@mentions)?

To make sure a specific person sees your comment, you can @mention them:

<Steps>
1. When typing your comment, type the `@` symbol.
2. Start typing the person's name.
3. Select the correct person from the list that appears.
4. Finish typing your comment and click **Post**.
5. The person you mentioned will get a notification.
</Steps>

### How can I edit my own process comments?

If you made a mistake in a comment you posted:

<Steps>
1. Find your comment in the list.
2. Click the **Edit** button (pencil icon ‚úèÔ∏è) on your comment.
3. Change the text.
4. Click **Save**.
</Steps>

### How do I delete my process comments?

If you need to remove a comment you posted:

<Steps>
1. Find your comment.
2. Click the **Delete** button (trash can icon üóëÔ∏è) on your comment.
3. Confirm that you want to delete it.
4. The comment will be permanently removed.
</Steps>

### What is the difference between process and task comments?

*   **Process comments**: For general discussion about the whole workflow. Visible at the bottom of the main process view.
*   **[Task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) comments**: For questions or updates about a *specific task*. Visible only when you open that task.

Use process comments for overall updates, and task comments for task-specific details.

### How does comment history work?

All process comments are saved with the process, creating a history of the discussion. This permanent record can be useful for understanding past decisions or getting new team members up to speed.

### Do template comments appear in launched processes?

No. Comments made on a template during the editing phase stay with the template - they do not inherit or carry over when you launch a process from that template. Template comments are for discussions about template design and structure, while process comments are for discussions about the actual running work. This separation keeps template editing discussions private and prevents confusion in active processes.
