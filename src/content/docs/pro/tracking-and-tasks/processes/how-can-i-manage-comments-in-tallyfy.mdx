## How to add, edit, and delete comments in processes

Process comments allow team members to discuss, ask questions, and provide updates about the overall process rather than individual tasks. This guide covers how to effectively use comments in Tallyfy processes.

### Adding process comments

1. Open the process you want to comment on
2. Scroll down to the **Comments** section at the bottom of the process view
3. Click in the comment field
4. Type your message or question
5. Click **Post** to publish your comment
6. Your comment will appear in the comments thread with your name and timestamp

### Using @mentions

To notify specific team members in your comment:

1. Type the @ symbol in your comment
2. Begin typing the name of the team member
3. Select the correct person from the dropdown list that appears
4. Finish your comment and click **Post**
5. The mentioned user will receive a notification about your comment

### Editing your process comments

To modify a comment you've already posted:

1. Locate your comment in the process comments section
2. Click the **Edit** button (pencil icon) in the top-right corner of your comment

### Process comments vs. task comments

- **Process comments** are visible to anyone with access to the process and appear at the process level
- **Task comments** are specific to individual tasks and appear only in the task view
- Use process comments for discussions about the entire process workflow
- Use task comments for discussions about specific task requirements or issues

### Viewing comment history

All process comments are preserved in chronological order, creating a complete record of discussions and decisions related to the process. This history is valuable for:

- Onboarding new team members
- Auditing process changes
- Understanding decision context
- Tracking process improvements over time
