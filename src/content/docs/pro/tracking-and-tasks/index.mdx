## Process and task tracking options

Tallyfy gives you two main views in the left sidebar to track your work:

*   **Tracker View**: Shows a high-level overview of all your running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). Think of it as the "big picture" view to see how entire workflows are progressing.
*   **Tasks View**: Shows a detailed list of individual [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), whether they are part of a process or one-off tasks. This is the "to-do list" view, focusing on specific actions.

Use the Tracker view to monitor overall progress and the Tasks view to manage your specific assignments.
