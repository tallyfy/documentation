## What comprehensive tracking options does Tallyfy provide?

Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> delivers two powerful tracking interfaces in the left sidebar to monitor and manage your organizational work comprehensively:

*   **Tracker View**: Provides a strategic high-level overview of all running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) across your organization. Consider this the "executive dashboard" view for monitoring how entire workflows progress through completion
*   **Tasks View**: Displays a detailed, actionable list of individual [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), encompassing both process-related tasks and standalone one-off assignments. This functions as your comprehensive "productivity dashboard" view, focusing on specific actionable items

### Why use Tallyfy's dual tracking approach?

Leverage the Tracker view for strategic workflow progress monitoring and the Tasks view for tactical assignment management with Workflow Made Easy<sup>®</sup>. This sophisticated dual-view approach ensures comprehensive workflow visibility at both organizational (macro) and individual (micro) levels.

According to [workflow management research](https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/business-process-management-platforms), effective process tracking significantly improves team productivity and reduces task completion times while enhancing operational transparency.
