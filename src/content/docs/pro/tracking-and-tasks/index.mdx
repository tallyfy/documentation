## Tracking options in Tallyfy

Tallyfy gives you two ways to track work - both in the left sidebar. Understanding [what a workflow is](https://tallyfy.com/what-is-a-workflow/) helps you get the most from them.

*   **Tracker View** - Shows all running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) at a glance. See which workflows are on track and which need attention across your organization.
*   **Tasks View** - Lists every [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) you need to complete - whether it's part of a process or a standalone assignment. Your personal to-do list.

### Why two different views?

The Tracker view is for monitoring entire workflows. The Tasks view is for getting work done. Think helicopter view versus street level - both matter at different times.
