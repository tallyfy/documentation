## Processes and tasks

Tallyfy has two icons on the left navigation:

- **Tracker** - which lets you track the high-level status of any process you've launched. Think of this as the "10,000 foot view"
- **Tasks** - which lets you track individual tasks - either one-off tasks or those that belong to a process. Think of this as the "10 foot view".
