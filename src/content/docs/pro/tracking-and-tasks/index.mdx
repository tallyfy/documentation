## What tracking options does Tallyfy provide?

Tallyfy gives you two main ways to track work - both found in the left sidebar. You'll use them for different purposes.

*   **Tracker View**: Shows all your running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) at a glance. Think of it as your bird's-eye view of everything happening across the organization. Perfect when you need to see which workflows are on track and which need attention
*   **Tasks View**: Lists every individual [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) you need to complete - whether they're part of a process or just one-off assignments. This is your personal to-do list on steroids

### Why two different views?

Simple. The Tracker view is for managers who need to monitor entire workflows. The Tasks view is for getting actual work done.

It's like the difference between watching traffic flow from a helicopter versus driving on the street. Both perspectives matter - just at different times.

According to [workflow management research](https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/business-process-management-platforms), teams that track processes effectively complete tasks 30% faster. Makes sense when you think about it - you can't improve what you can't see.
