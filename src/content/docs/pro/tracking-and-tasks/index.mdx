## Process and task tracking options

Tallyfy provides two complementary tracking interfaces, accessible from the left navigation panel:

* **Tracker** - Provides a high-level overview of process status and progress (macro view)
* **Tasks** - Offers detailed management of individual tasks, both standalone and within processes (micro view)

The Tracker view helps you monitor overall process status, while the Tasks view enables you to focus on specific action items assigned to you or your team.
