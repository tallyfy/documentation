## Tasks view - see all your tasks across all your processes

The "[Tasks" view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/) provides a clear way to see all your assigned [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/). It also contains _Filters_ along the top to filter down what you see in various ways. For example:

* You can filter for tasks assigned to you
* You can filter for tasks assigned to someone else (including [guest users](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) by their email address)
* You can filter for completed tasks by changing the status filter from 'To Do' to 'Completed'
* You can filter by task state (Overdue, Due Soon, On time)
* You can filter by tags, [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), folders, and more

The Tasks view is a simple way to see the smaller details and individual tasks within various [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). You can create one-off or ad-hoc tasks within this view.

:::tip[Not seeing expected tasks?]
If you're looking for tasks assigned to guests or completed tasks that aren't appearing, make sure to adjust your filters accordingly. You may need to:
1. Change the Status filter from "To Do" to "Completed" to see completed tasks
2. Add an Assignee filter and select the specific guest's email address
3. Check if other active filters might be restricting your view

See our [Customize the task view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/how-can-i-customize-task-views-in-tallyfy/) guide for detailed filtering instructions.
