## What is the Tasks view in Tallyfy?

The **Tasks View** (accessible through the left sidebar) gives you a comprehensive look at all your individual tasks across your entire Tallyfy workspace.

This centralized view includes tasks from running processes plus standalone one-off tasks - basically your complete master to-do list for all Tallyfy work.

### How do I use filters in the Tasks view?

The Tasks View's **Filters** are your main tool for organizing and finding exactly what you need for maximum productivity.

You can filter tasks by several different criteria:

*   **Assignee**: See tasks assigned to yourself, someone else, a guest (by email), or tasks with no assignee.
*   **Status**: See tasks that are 'To Do' (default) or 'Completed'.
*   **Task State**: See tasks that are 'Overdue', 'Due Soon', or 'On Time'.
*   Tags, Templates, Folders, and more...

See [Customize the Task View](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/how-can-i-customize-task-views-in-tallyfy/) for details on using filters.

:::tip[Can't Find a Task? Check Your Filters!]
If you expect to see a task (like one assigned to a guest or one you completed) but it's not showing up, the most common reason is your filters. Make sure you have the correct Assignee and Status filters selected (e.g., filter by the guest's email or change Status to 'Completed').

### How can I create tasks from this view?

You can also [create new one-off tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-create-a-one-off-task-in-tallyfy/) directly from this view using the main **+ Create** button.
