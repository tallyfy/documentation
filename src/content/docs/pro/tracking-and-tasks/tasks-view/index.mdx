## Tasks view - see all your individual tasks

The **[Tasks View](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/)** (accessed from the left sidebar) shows you a detailed list of individual [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/). This includes tasks assigned to you from running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), as well as any one-off tasks.

Think of it as your master to-do list across all your work in Tallyfy.

### Using filters

The key feature of the Tasks View is the **Filters** at the top. These let you narrow down the list to find exactly what you need. You can filter by:

*   **Assignee**: See tasks assigned to yourself, someone else, a guest (by email), or tasks with no assignee.
*   **Status**: See tasks that are 'To Do' (default) or 'Completed'.
*   **Task State**: See tasks that are 'Overdue', 'Due Soon', or 'On Time'.
*   Tags, Templates, Folders, and more...

See [Customize the Task View](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/how-can-i-customize-task-views-in-tallyfy/) for details on using filters.

:::tip[Can't Find a Task? Check Your Filters!]
If you expect to see a task (like one assigned to a guest or one you completed) but it's not showing up, the most common reason is your filters. Make sure you have the correct Assignee and Status filters selected (e.g., filter by the guest's email or change Status to 'Completed').

### Creating tasks

You can also [create new one-off tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-create-a-one-off-task-in-tallyfy/) directly from this view using the main **+ Create** button.
