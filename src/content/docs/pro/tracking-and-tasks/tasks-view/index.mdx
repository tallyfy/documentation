## What is the Tasks view in Tallyfy?

The **[Tasks View](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/)** (accessible through the left sidebar) provides a comprehensive interface displaying detailed lists of individual [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) across your entire Tallyfy workspace.

This centralized view encompasses tasks assigned from running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) alongside standalone one-off tasks, functioning as your complete master to-do list for all Tallyfy work items.

### How do I use filters in the Tasks view?

The Tasks View's **Filters** feature represents the primary organizational tool enabling precise task list refinement for optimal productivity.

These intelligent filters allow targeted task discovery through multiple criteria:

*   **Assignee**: See tasks assigned to yourself, someone else, a guest (by email), or tasks with no assignee.
*   **Status**: See tasks that are 'To Do' (default) or 'Completed'.
*   **Task State**: See tasks that are 'Overdue', 'Due Soon', or 'On Time'.
*   Tags, Templates, Folders, and more...

See [Customize the Task View](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/how-can-i-customize-task-views-in-tallyfy/) for details on using filters.

:::tip[Can't Find a Task? Check Your Filters!]
If you expect to see a task (like one assigned to a guest or one you completed) but it's not showing up, the most common reason is your filters. Make sure you have the correct Assignee and Status filters selected (e.g., filter by the guest's email or change Status to 'Completed').

### How can I create tasks from this view?

You can also [create new one-off tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-create-a-one-off-task-in-tallyfy/) directly from this view using the main **+ Create** button.
