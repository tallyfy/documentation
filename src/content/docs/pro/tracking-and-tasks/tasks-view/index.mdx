## Tasks view - see all your tasks across all your processes

The "Tasks" view provides a clear way to see all your assigned tasks. It also contains _Filters_ along the top to filter down what you see in various ways. For example:

* You can filter for tasks assigned to you
* You can filter for tasks assigned to someone else
* You can filter for completed tasks only

... and so on. The Tasks view is a simple way to see the smaller details and individual tasks within various processes. You can create one-off or ad-hoc tasks within this view.
