## The Tasks view

The **Tasks View** in Tallyfy (click it in the left sidebar) shows all your individual tasks in one place - across every process and project in your workspace.

Think of it as your master to-do list. It pulls together tasks from running processes plus any standalone one-off tasks you've created. No more hunting through emails or spreadsheets to figure out what you need to do today.

### How do I use filters in the Tasks view?

Filters help you find what you need. Fast.

The **Filters** button opens up powerful sorting options that let you slice and dice your task list however you want. Here's what you can filter by:

*   **Assignee**: See tasks assigned to yourself, someone else, a guest (by email), or unassigned tasks waiting for an owner
*   **Status**: View tasks that are 'To Do' (that's the default) or switch to 'Completed' to see what's done
*   **Task State**: Check which tasks are 'Overdue' (yikes), 'Due Soon' (better get moving), or 'On Time' (you're good)
*   Tags, Templates, Folders, and more...

See [Customize the Task View](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/how-can-i-customize-task-views-in-tallyfy/) for details on using filters.

:::tip[Can't Find a Task? Check Your Filters!]
Missing a task you know exists? Nine times out of ten, it's the filters. Maybe you're looking for a task assigned to a guest (filter by their email) or something you already finished (switch Status to 'Completed'). Double-check those filter settings - they're probably hiding what you're looking for.

:::note[Tasks mixed from multiple processes?]
**Finding the Tasks view confusing with many processes running?** This is normal - the Tasks view shows ALL tasks from ALL processes mixed together. For a process-grouped view:
1. Use the **Tracker view** instead - it organizes by process
2. Click into any specific process to see only its tasks
3. Or filter the Tasks view by Template/Process name to focus on one workflow

The Tasks view is designed as a personal to-do list showing everything assigned to you, regardless of which process it's from. Use the Tracker view when you need process-level organization.

### How can I create tasks from this view?

Need to add a quick task? Hit the **+ Create** button.

You can [create new one-off tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-create-a-one-off-task-in-tallyfy/) right from this view - perfect for those random to-dos that pop up but don't need a full process. Think "Call vendor about pricing" or "Review quarterly report" - simple stuff that just needs to get done.
