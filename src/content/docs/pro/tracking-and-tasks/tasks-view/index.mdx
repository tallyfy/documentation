## The Tasks view

Click **Tasks** in the left sidebar to see all your tasks in one place - from every running process and any standalone one-off tasks you've created. It's your master to-do list in Tallyfy.

### How do I use filters?

Click the **Filters** button to narrow down your task list. Here's what you can filter by:

*   **Assignee** - your own tasks, a specific coworker, a guest (by email), everyone, or unassigned tasks
*   **Status** - "To Do" (default) or "Completed"
*   **Task state** - "Overdue", "Due Soon", or "On Time"
*   **Tags, templates, folders** - and more

See [Customize the task view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/how-can-i-customize-task-views-in-tallyfy/) for full details on filters and sorting.

:::tip[Can't find a task? Check your filters]
Missing a task you know exists? It's almost always the filters. Try filtering by guest email, or switch Status to "Completed". The filters are probably hiding what you're looking for.
:::

:::note[Tasks mixed from multiple processes?]
The Tasks view shows ALL tasks from ALL processes mixed together. That's by design - it's a personal to-do list. If you need a process-grouped view:
1. Use the **Tracker view** instead - it organizes by process
2. Click into a specific process to see only its tasks
3. Or filter by template/process name to focus on one workflow

### How can I create tasks from this view?

Hit the **+ Create** button to [create a one-off task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-to-create-a-one-off-task-in-tallyfy/) - perfect for quick to-dos that don't need a full process.
