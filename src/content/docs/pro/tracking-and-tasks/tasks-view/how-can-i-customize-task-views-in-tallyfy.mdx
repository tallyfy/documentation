## Using filters and sorting in the task view

Tallyfy's custom task views allow you to sort through [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), find tasks assigned to other [team members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) and [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/), and manage workloads. Here's how you can get started:

### Add filter

To begin, navigate to the 'Add Filter' option in the [Tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/) tab. Next, add as many filters as necessary. You have the flexibility to filter by status, task [assignee](/products/pro/documenting/members/) (including guest emails), task state (Overdue, Due Soon, On time), tag, [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) used, or even by the name of the [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).

#### Filtering by task status

To view completed tasks (instead of the default "To Do" tasks):
<Steps>
1. Click 'Add Filter' at the top of the [Tasks view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/)
2. Select 'Status' from the dropdown menu
3. Change the selection from 'To Do' to 'Completed'
4. All completed [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) matching your other filter criteria will now be displayed
</Steps>

:::tip[No tasks showing?]
If no tasks appear when filtering for completed tasks, you may need to adjust other filters that might be restricting your view, such as time period filters or assignee filters.

#### Filtering by assignee status

To view tasks that have no assignees:
<Steps>
1. Click 'Add Filter' at the top of the [Tasks view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/)
2. Select 'Assignee' from the dropdown menu
3. Select the "Assigned to nobody" option
4. The view will update to show only [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) that currently have no assignees
</Steps>

This filter is useful for finding tasks that need to be assigned or for managing a pool of unassigned work.

#### Filtering by guest email

To view tasks assigned to specific [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/):
<Steps>
1. Click 'Add Filter' at the top of the [Tasks view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/)
2. Select 'Assignee' from the dropdown menu
3. In the search field, type the guest's email address
4. Select the guest email from the matching results
5. The view will update to show only [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) assigned to that specific guest
</Steps>

You can combine multiple filters - for example, selecting both 'Completed' status and a specific guest email to see all completed tasks for that guest.

### Task sorting

Tasks can be sorted by Most Delayed or Most Recent. Select your preferred sorting option from the dropdown list in the top right corner.

- **Status** - Filter by To Do or Completed tasks
- **Assignee** - Filter by specific [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) or guest emails
- **Task State** - View tasks by their timing (Overdue, Due Soon, On time)
- **Tag** - Filter by tags applied to tasks
