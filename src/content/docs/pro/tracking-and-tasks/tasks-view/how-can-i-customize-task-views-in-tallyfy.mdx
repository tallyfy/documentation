## Filters and sorting in the tasks view

Tallyfy's **[Tasks View](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/)** shows all your [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in one place. Filter and sort this list to find overdue tasks, work assigned to a specific person, or items from a particular template.

### How do I add filters?

Click **Add Filter** at the top of the Tasks view. You can stack multiple filters - they work together to narrow your list. Here's what you can filter by:

*   **Status** - See your 'To Do' tasks (the default), 'Completed', or 'All'
*   **Assignee** - Find tasks for specific [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/), [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) (by email), groups, or roles
*   **Task State** - Show what's 'Overdue', 'Due Soon', 'On Time', or has a reported issue
*   **Tag** - Pull up tasks with specific tags
*   **Template** - Show only tasks from a particular [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)
*   **Process Name** - Find tasks within a specific [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) by name
*   **Folder** - View tasks in a [folder](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/how-can-i-add-tasks-to-folders-in-tallyfy/)

### How can I sort tasks?

Use the sort dropdown in your Tasks view. Three options:
*   **Most Recent** - shows tasks with the latest activity first (this is the default)
*   **Most Delayed** - puts overdue tasks at the top
*   **Recently Completed** - shows recently finished tasks (only visible when viewing completed tasks)

Combine filters and sorting for fast results. Filter by assignee and sort by most delayed to see who's falling behind. Filter by template and sort by most recent to track the latest activity on specific workflows.
