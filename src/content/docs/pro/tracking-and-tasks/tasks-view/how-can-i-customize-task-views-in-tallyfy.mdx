## Using filters and sorting in the tasks view

The **[Tasks View](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/)** lets you see and manage your individual [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/). You can customize this view using filters and sorting options to find exactly what you need.

### Adding filters

Click the **Add Filter** button at the top of the Tasks view to narrow down the list. You can add multiple filters at the same time. Available filters include:

*   **Status**: Show only 'To Do' tasks (default) or 'Completed' tasks.
*   **Assignee**: Show tasks assigned to specific [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/), [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) (by email), or tasks assigned to 'Nobody Assigned'.
*   **Task State**: Show tasks that are 'Overdue', 'Due Soon', or 'On time'.
*   **Tag**: Show tasks that have specific tags applied.
*   **Template**: Show tasks that came from a specific [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).
*   **Process Name**: Show tasks belonging to a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) with a specific name.
*   **Folder**: Show tasks you've organized into a specific [folder](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/how-can-i-add-tasks-to-folders-in-tallyfy/).
*   **Date Range**: Filter tasks based on their due date or creation date.
