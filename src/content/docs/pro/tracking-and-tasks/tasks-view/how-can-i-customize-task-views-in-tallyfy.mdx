## How can I use filters and sorting in the tasks view?

The Tallyfy **[Tasks View](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/)** shows all your [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in one place. You can filter and sort this list to find exactly what you need - whether that's overdue tasks, work assigned to a specific person, or items from a particular template. It's straightforward.

### How do I add filters to the tasks view?

Click the **Add Filter** button at the top of the Tasks view. Simple as that. You can stack multiple filters - they work together to narrow down your list. Here's what you can filter by:

*   **Status**: See just your 'To Do' tasks (that's the default) or switch to 'Completed' ones
*   **Assignee**: Find tasks for specific [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/), [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) (by email), or spot unassigned work with 'Nobody Assigned'
*   **Task State**: Zero in on what's 'Overdue', 'Due Soon', or still 'On time'
*   **Tag**: Pull up tasks with specific tags - great if you tag by project or priority
*   **Template**: Show only tasks from a particular [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)
*   **Process Name**: Find tasks within a specific [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) by name
*   **Folder**: View tasks you've tucked into a [folder](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/how-can-i-add-tasks-to-folders-in-tallyfy/)
*   **Date Range**: Filter by due date or creation date - perfect for weekly planning

### How can I sort tasks in the tasks view?

Look for the dropdown in the top right corner of your Tasks view. You've got two sorting options:
*   **Most Delayed** - puts your overdue tasks right at the top (where they probably need to be)
*   **Most Recent** - shows tasks with fresh activity first

Mix filters and sorting together, and you'll find what you need in seconds. Filter by assignee, sort by most delayed - instantly see who's falling behind. Filter by template, sort by most recent - track the latest activity on specific workflows. The combinations are endless.
