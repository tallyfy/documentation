## How to customize the task view to suit your needs

Tallyfy's custom task views allow you to easily sort through tasks, find tasks assigned to other team members and guests, and effectively manage workloads. Here's how you can get started:

## Add filter

To begin, navigate to the 'Add Filter' option in the Tasks tab. Next, add as many filters as necessary. You have the flexibility to filter by status, task assignee (including guest emails), task state (Overdue, Due Soon, On time), tag, template used, or even by the name of the process.

### Filtering by task status

To view completed tasks (instead of the default "To Do" tasks):
1. Click 'Add Filter' at the top of the Tasks view
2. Select 'Status' from the dropdown menu
3. Change the selection from 'To Do' to 'Completed'
4. All completed tasks matching your other filter criteria will now be displayed

:::tip[No tasks showing?]
If no tasks appear when filtering for completed tasks, you may need to adjust other filters that might be restricting your view, such as time period filters or assignee filters.

### Filtering by guest email

To view tasks assigned to specific guests:
1. Click 'Add Filter' at the top of the Tasks view
2. Select 'Assignee' from the dropdown menu
3. In the search field, type the guest's email address
4. Select the guest email from the matching results
5. The view will update to show only tasks assigned to that specific guest

You can combine multiple filters - for example, selecting both 'Completed' status and a specific guest email to see all completed tasks for that guest.

## Easy Task Sorting

Tasks can be sorted by Most Delayed or Most Recent. Select your preferred sorting option from the dropdown list in the top right corner.
