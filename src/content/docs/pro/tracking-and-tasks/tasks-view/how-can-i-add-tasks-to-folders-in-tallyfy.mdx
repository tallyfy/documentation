## How can I organize my work using folders and tags?

Tallyfy gives you folders and tags to organize your work - but here's the thing: there are actually two separate folder systems. It can be confusing at first. Once you understand how each works, you'll have plenty of options for keeping everything organized.

### Why does Tallyfy have two separate folder systems?

Tallyfy has **two completely separate sets of folders**:

1.  **Template Folders**: Used *only* in the **Templates** library section to organize your master templates. [Learn more here](/products/pro/documenting/templates/organize-templates-into-folders/).
2.  **Task/Process Folders**: Used *only* in the **Tasks** and **Tracker** views to organize your *active* work (running processes and individual tasks).

These systems are separate because you might want to organize your blueprints (templates) differently from how you organize your ongoing projects (processes). Makes sense when you think about it - your template library needs one structure, but your active work needs another.

**Example:**
*   **Template Folder**: `HR Templates` > `Onboarding`
*   **Process Folders**: `Active Onboardings - Sales Team`, `Active Onboardings - IT Team`

This article focuses on **Task/Process Folders** used in the Tasks and Tracker views.

### How can I organize active tasks into folders?

You can create folders within your **Tasks** view to group related tasks (both one-off tasks and tasks from running processes). Pretty straightforward.

#### How do I add a task to a folder?
1.  Find the task in your **Tasks** view.
2.  Click the menu icon (three dots ⋮) on the task card.
3.  Select **Add to Folder**.
4.  Choose an existing folder or create a new one.

#### How do I view tasks in a folder?
1.  Go to the **Tasks** view.
2.  Click **Add filter**.
3.  Select **Folder** as the filter type.
4.  Choose the folder you want to see tasks from.

### How can I organize running processes into folders?

You can also organize entire running processes into folders within the **Tracker** view. Works the same way.

#### How do I add a process to a folder?
1.  Go to the **Tracker** view.
2.  Find the running process card.
3.  Click the menu icon (three dots ⋮) on the process card.
4.  Select **Add to Folder**.
5.  Choose an existing folder or create a new one.

#### How do I view processes in a folder?
1.  Go to the **Tracker** view.
2.  Click **Add Filter**.
3.  Select **Folder** as the filter type.
4.  Choose the folder you want to see processes from.

### How can I use tags for extra organization?

In addition to folders, you can use [Tags](/products/pro/documenting/templates/how-to-manage-templates-and-processes-with-tags/) (flexible labels) to organize both tasks and processes.

*   **Tagging Tasks**: Open the task, click the menu (⋮), select **Add Tags**.
*   **Tagging Processes**: Open the process, click the menu (⋮), select **Add Tags**.
*   **Filtering by Tag**: Use the **Tag** filter option in both the **Tasks** and **Tracker** views.

Tags let items belong to multiple categories (for example, a task could be tagged "Urgent" and "Client A"), while folders provide a single location. Together, they give you plenty of ways to organize your work exactly how you want.
