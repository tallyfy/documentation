## Organizing work with folders and tags

You can organize work in Tallyfy using two separate folder systems and tags. This article covers the **Task/Process Folders** used in the **Tasks** and **Tracker** views.

### Two folder systems

Tallyfy has **two completely separate sets of folders**:

1.  **Template Folders** - used *only* in the **Templates** library to organize master templates. [Learn more here](/products/pro/documenting/templates/organize-templates-into-folders/).
2.  **Task/Process Folders** - used *only* in the **Tasks** and **Tracker** views to organize *active* work (running processes and individual tasks).

These are independent systems. For example:
*   **Template Folder**: `HR Templates` > `Onboarding`
*   **Process Folders**: `Active Onboardings - Sales Team`, `Active Onboardings - IT Team`

### Adding tasks to folders

1.  Find the task in your **Tasks** view.
2.  Click the menu icon (three dots) on the task card.
3.  Select **Add to folder(s)**.
4.  Choose an existing folder or create a new one.

### Filtering tasks by folder

1.  Go to the **Tasks** view.
2.  Click **Add Filter**.
3.  Select **Folder** as the filter type.
4.  Pick the folder you want to view.

### Adding processes to folders

1.  Go to the **Tracker** view.
2.  Find the running process card.
3.  Click the menu icon (three dots) on the process card.
4.  Select **Add to folder(s)**.
5.  Choose an existing folder or create a new one.

### Filtering processes by folder

1.  Go to the **Tracker** view.
2.  Click **Add Filter**.
3.  Select **Folder** as the filter type.
4.  Pick the folder you want to view.

### Using tags

[Tags](/products/pro/documenting/templates/how-to-manage-templates-and-processes-with-tags/) work alongside folders as flexible labels for tasks and processes.

*   **Tagging Processes**: Open the process, click the menu, and select **Add Tags**.
*   **Filtering by Tag**: Use the **Tag** filter in both **Tasks** and **Tracker** views.

Tags let items belong to multiple categories at once - a task could be tagged "Urgent" and "Client A". Folders give each item a single location.
