## Understanding folder organization in Tallyfy

Tallyfy uses separate folder systems for different elements:

- **Template folders** - For organizing your process templates (in Templates section)
- **Task/Process folders** - For organizing active tasks and processes (in Tasks and Tracker views)

:::note[Important distinction]
Folders created for templates are completely separate from folders used for tasks and processes. Each system has its own set of folders.

## Organizing tasks into folders

Sometimes it can be challenging to keep track of all your tasks. With folders, you can easily sort and group your tasks, making them super easy to find.

### Add tasks to folders

1. Click on the three dots located at the top right of the task.

2. In the dropdown menu, select "Add to Folder".

3. A window will appear, allowing you to choose the desired folder for the task.

1. Go to the **Tasks** tab.

3. Choose the desired folder you want to filter on.

## Organizing processes into folders

You can also organize entire processes into folders for better management.

### Add processes to folders

1. Go to the **Tracker** view.

2. Locate the process you want to organize.

3. Click on the three dots menu at the top right of the process.

4. Select "Add to Folder" from the dropdown menu.

5. Choose the desired folder or create a new one.

### View processes in folders

1. Go to the **Tracker** view.

2. Click on the **Filter** button.

3. Select **Folder** from the filter options.

4. Choose the folder you want to view.

## Using tags with tasks and processes

Tags provide another way to organize and filter your work in Tallyfy.

### Tagging tasks

1. Select a task in the **Tasks** view.

2. Click the three dots menu and select "Add Tags".

3. Add existing tags or create new ones.

4. To filter tasks by tag, use the **Tag** filter in the **Tasks** view.

### Tagging processes

1. Select a process in the **Tracker** view.

2. Click the three dots menu and select "Add Tags".

3. Add existing tags or create new ones.

4. To filter processes by tag, use the **Tag** filter in the **Tracker** view.

That's it! Now you can easily organize and access your tasks and processes using both folders and tags.
