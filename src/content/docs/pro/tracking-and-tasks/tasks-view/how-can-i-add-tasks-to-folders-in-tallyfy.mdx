## Organizing work with folders and tags

Tallyfy has two separate folder systems plus tags for organization.

### Two folder systems

Tallyfy has **two completely separate sets of folders**:

1.  **Template Folders**: Used *only* in the **Templates** library section to organize your master templates. [Learn more here](/products/pro/documenting/templates/organize-templates-into-folders/).
2.  **Task/Process Folders**: Used *only* in the **Tasks** and **Tracker** views to organize your *active* work (running processes and individual tasks).

Templates and active work have separate folder systems because they need different organizational structures.

**Example:**
*   **Template Folder**: `HR Templates` > `Onboarding`
*   **Process Folders**: `Active Onboardings - Sales Team`, `Active Onboardings - IT Team`

This article focuses on **Task/Process Folders** used in the Tasks and Tracker views.

### Organizing tasks into folders

Create folders in the **Tasks** view to group related tasks.

#### Adding tasks to folders
1.  Find the task in your **Tasks** view.
2.  Click the menu icon (three dots ⋮) on the task card.
3.  Select **Add to Folder**.
4.  Choose an existing folder or create a new one.

#### Viewing tasks by folder
1.  Go to the **Tasks** view.
2.  Click **Add filter**.
3.  Select **Folder** as the filter type.
4.  Choose the folder you want to see tasks from.

### Organizing processes into folders

Running processes can be organized into folders in the **Tracker** view.

#### Adding processes to folders
1.  Go to the **Tracker** view.
2.  Find the running process card.
3.  Click the menu icon (three dots ⋮) on the process card.
4.  Select **Add to Folder**.
5.  Choose an existing folder or create a new one.

#### Viewing processes by folder
1.  Go to the **Tracker** view.
2.  Click **Add Filter**.
3.  Select **Folder** as the filter type.
4.  Choose the folder you want to see processes from.

### Using tags

In addition to folders, you can use [Tags](/products/pro/documenting/templates/how-to-manage-templates-and-processes-with-tags/) (flexible labels) to organize both tasks and processes.

*   **Tagging Tasks**: Open the task, click the menu (⋮), select **Add Tags**.
*   **Tagging Processes**: Open the process, click the menu (⋮), select **Add Tags**.
*   **Filtering by Tag**: Use the **Tag** filter option in both the **Tasks** and **Tracker** views.

Tags let items belong to multiple categories (a task could be tagged "Urgent" and "Client A"), while folders provide a single location.
