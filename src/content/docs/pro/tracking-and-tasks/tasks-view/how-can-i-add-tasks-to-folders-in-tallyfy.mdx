## Understanding folder organization in Tallyfy

Tallyfy uses separate folder systems for different elements:

- **Template folders** - For organizing your process templates (in Templates section)
- **Task/Process folders** - For organizing active tasks and processes (in Tasks and Tracker views)

:::note[Important distinction]
Folders created for templates are completely separate from folders used for tasks and processes. Each system has its own set of folders.
:::

### Why two separate folder systems?

The organizational needs for templates (blueprints) are often very different from the organizational needs for active processes. Here are some examples:

#### Example 1: HR Onboarding
- **Templates folder structure**: You might have a blueprints folder called "HR" containing templates like "Employee Onboarding", "Benefits Enrollment", etc.
- **Processes folder structure**: When launching an "Employee Onboarding" process, you might want to organize these by team in folders like "Sales Onboardings" or "IT Onboardings".

#### Example 2: Client Work Requests
- **Templates folder structure**: You could have a blueprints folder called "Client Ops" with templates for different types of client requests.
- **Processes folder structure**: When launching these templates, you'd organize the active processes by client, with folders like "Coca Cola Work Requests" or "Microsoft Support Tickets".

This dual folder system gives you the flexibility to organize your process library in a way that makes sense for template management, while separately organizing your active processes based on how your team executes and monitors work.
