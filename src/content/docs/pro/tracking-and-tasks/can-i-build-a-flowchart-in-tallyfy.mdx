## How Tallyfy compares to flowcharts, spreadsheets, and docs

Tallyfy offers a modern, effective way to manage processes compared to tools like flowcharts, spreadsheets, or plain documents.

### Why Tallyfy is better than flowcharts

Flowcharts can show a process, but they can't *execute* the process. Tallyfy:

*   **Includes more detail**: Add detailed instructions, videos, and files directly to tasks.
*   **Tracks progress**: See exact process status in real-time.
*   **Assigns work**: Assign responsibility and deadlines for tasks.
*   **Is actionable**: Turns the diagram into a workflow people follow.

### Why Tallyfy is better than spreadsheets

Using spreadsheets to track processes can quickly get messy. Tallyfy provides:

*   **One place for everything**: Manage all steps/processes in one place.
*   **Clear responsibility**: Clearly see who is assigned to each task.
*   **Structured steps**: Follow a defined order with rules and logic.
*   **Controlled access**: Set different permission levels.
*   **No version confusion**: Everyone sees the current process.

### Why Tallyfy is better than documents

Using simple documents (like Word docs) for processes isn't effective. Tallyfy offers:

*   **Easy access to info**: Quickly find the right step/info.
*   **Access anywhere**: Access Tallyfy on any device.
*   **Track viewing**: Track viewing/completion of steps.
*   **Active workflow**: Turns static docs into a live process people use.
