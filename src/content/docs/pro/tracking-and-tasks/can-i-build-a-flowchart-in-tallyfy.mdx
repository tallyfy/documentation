## How Tallyfy compares to flowcharts, spreadsheets, and docs

Tallyfy workflow management offers a much better approach to managing processes than old-school tools like flowcharts, spreadsheets, or basic documents.

### Why Tallyfy is better than flowcharts

Sure, flowcharts can show you a process - but they can't actually *run* it. Here's what Tallyfy does differently:

*   **Includes more detail**: Add detailed instructions, videos, and files directly to tasks.
*   **Tracks progress**: See exact process status in real-time.
*   **Assigns work**: Assign responsibility and deadlines for tasks.
*   **Is actionable**: Turns the diagram into a workflow people follow.

### Why Tallyfy is better than spreadsheets

Anyone who's tried tracking processes in spreadsheets knows it gets messy fast. Tallyfy gives you:

*   **One place for everything**: Manage all steps/processes in one place.
*   **Clear responsibility**: Clearly see who is assigned to each task.
*   **Structured steps**: Follow a defined order with rules and logic.
*   **Controlled access**: Set different permission levels.
*   **No version confusion**: Everyone sees the current process.

### Why Tallyfy is better than documents

Simple documents like Word docs just don't cut it for real processes. With Tallyfy, you get:

*   **Easy access to info**: Quickly find the right step/info.
*   **Access anywhere**: Access Tallyfy on any device.
*   **Track viewing**: Track viewing/completion of steps.
*   **Active workflow**: Turns static docs into a live process people use.
