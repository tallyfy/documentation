## How Tallyfy compares to flowcharts, spreadsheets, and docs

No, Tallyfy isn't for building flowcharts - it's something much better. You're looking for a way to actually run and track your processes, not just draw them.

### Why Tallyfy is better than flowcharts

Sure, flowcharts can show you a process - but they can't actually *run* it. That's the problem. Here's what makes Tallyfy different:

*   **Includes everything you need**: Add detailed instructions, videos, and files right where people need them. No more hunting for that PDF guide.
*   **Shows you what's happening now**: See exactly where each process stands in real-time. Is John stuck on step 3? You'll know.
*   **Gets work to the right people**: Assign specific tasks with deadlines - and Tallyfy sends automatic reminders.
*   **People actually use it**: Unlike that flowchart gathering dust on the shared drive, this becomes a living workflow your team follows daily.

### Why Tallyfy is better than spreadsheets

Anyone who's tried tracking processes in spreadsheets knows it gets messy fast. You've been there - multiple versions floating around, nobody updating their status, that one cell with the broken formula.

Tallyfy fixes all that:

*   **Everything lives in one spot**: No more jumping between 15 different spreadsheets to track your processes. It's all here.
*   **You know who's doing what**: Each task shows exactly who's responsible. No more "I thought Sarah was handling that" moments.
*   **Steps happen in order**: The workflow follows your actual process - with smart rules that route tasks based on what happened before.
*   **People see only what they need**: Set permissions so contractors see their tasks while managers see everything.
*   **One version, always current**: Forget "Process_Tracker_v2_FINAL_FINAL_actually_final.xlsx" - everyone works from the same live workflow.

### Why Tallyfy is better than documents

Word docs and PDFs might work for storing information, but they're terrible for actually running processes. Think about it - when's the last time your team enthusiastically opened that 47-page procedures manual?

Here's the difference:

*   **Find what you need instantly**: Instead of scrolling through pages, jump straight to the step you're on. Simple.
*   **Work from anywhere**: Phone, tablet, laptop - Tallyfy works on all of them. Your process follows you.
*   **Know who's actually following the process**: See who's viewed instructions, who's completed steps, and where things are stuck. Documents can't tell you any of that.
*   **It's alive**: This isn't a static document - it's an active workflow that guides people through each step, sends reminders, and tracks everything.
