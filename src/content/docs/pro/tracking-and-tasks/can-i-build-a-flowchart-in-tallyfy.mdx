## How Tallyfy Compares to Flowcharts, Spreadsheets, and Docs

Tallyfy offers a more modern and effective way to manage processes compared to traditional tools like flowcharts, spreadsheets, or plain documents.

### Why Tallyfy is Better than Flowcharts

Flowcharts can show a process visually, but they can't *run* the process. Tallyfy:

*   **Includes more detail**: Add rich instructions, videos, and files directly to tasks.
*   **Tracks progress**: See exactly where the process stands in real-time.
*   **Assigns work**: Give specific people responsibility and deadlines for tasks.
*   **Is actionable**: Turns the picture into a workflow people actually follow.

### Why Tallyfy is Better than Spreadsheets

Using spreadsheets to track processes can get messy quickly. Tallyfy provides:

*   **One place for everything**: Manage all steps and processes together.
*   **Clear responsibility**: Easily see who is assigned to each task.
*   **Structured steps**: Follow a set order with rules and logic.
*   **Controlled access**: Give different people different levels of permission.
*   **No version confusion**: Everyone always sees the current, correct process.

### Why Tallyfy is Better than Documents

Managing processes with simple documents (like Word docs) isn't efficient. Tallyfy offers:

*   **Easy access to info**: Find the right step or instruction quickly.
*   **Access anywhere**: Use Tallyfy on any device with internet.
*   **Track viewing**: See who has seen or completed steps.
*   **Active workflow**: Turns static instructions into a live process people interact with.
