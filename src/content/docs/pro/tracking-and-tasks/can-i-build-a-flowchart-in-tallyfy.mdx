## How Tallyfy compares to flowcharts, spreadsheets, and docs

Tallyfy isn't for building flowcharts - it runs and tracks your processes instead of just drawing them.

### Why Tallyfy beats flowcharts

Flowcharts show a process but can't *run* it. That's the core problem.

*   **Instructions, videos, and files on each step**: Attach what people need right where they need it. No hunting for that PDF guide.
*   **Real-time status**: See exactly where each process stands. Is John stuck on step 3? You'll know instantly.
*   **Deadlines and automatic reminders**: Assign tasks to specific people with due dates - Tallyfy nudges them automatically.
*   **People actually use it**: Unlike a flowchart gathering dust on the shared drive, Tallyfy becomes a living workflow your team follows daily.

### Why Tallyfy beats spreadsheets

Tracking processes in spreadsheets gets messy fast - multiple versions, nobody updating status, broken formulas.

Tallyfy fixes that:

*   **One place for everything**: Stop jumping between 15 spreadsheets. All your processes live here.
*   **Clear ownership**: Each task shows exactly who's responsible. No more "I thought Sarah was handling that."
*   **Steps run in order**: Workflows follow your actual process - with rules that route tasks based on previous answers.
*   **Permissions built in**: Contractors see only their tasks. Managers see everything.
*   **Always current**: Forget "Process_Tracker_v2_FINAL_FINAL.xlsx" - everyone works from the same live workflow.

### Why Tallyfy beats documents

Word docs and PDFs store information but can't run processes. When's the last time your team opened that 47-page procedures manual?

*   **Jump to your step**: No scrolling through pages - go straight to where you are.
*   **Works on any device**: Phone, tablet, laptop - Tallyfy works on all of them.
*   **Track who's doing what**: See who's completed steps and where things are stuck. Documents can't tell you that.
*   **Active, not static**: Tallyfy guides people through each step, sends reminders, and tracks completion automatically.
