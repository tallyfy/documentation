## Applying for the non-profit discount

Tallyfy offers a **20% lifetime discount** on annual Tallyfy Pro plans for qualifying non-profit and charitable organizations.

## Does my organization qualify?

To qualify, your organization generally needs official charitable status recognized by the government tax authority in your country (like the IRS 501(c)(3) status in the US).

However, certain types of organizations are generally **not eligible**, including:

*   Political or legislative groups.
*   Religious organizations (churches, etc.).
*   Schools, colleges, universities.
*   Government agencies.
*   Organizations focused on influencing public opinion.
*   Hospitals or health insurance providers.
*   Private foundations.

Also, organizations that discriminate or require a specific religious affiliation for their services are not eligible.

Eligibility is determined by Tallyfy. If you're unsure if you qualify, please contact Tallyfy support before applying.

## How to apply for the discount

If you believe your organization qualifies:

<Steps>
1. Make sure you have a Tallyfy account set up. If not, sign up at [tallyfy.com/start/](https://tallyfy.com/start/). You'll need your [Tallyfy Organization ID](/products/pro/miscellaneous/how-to-find-your-tallyfy-ids/).
2. Contact Tallyfy support (via the help bubble or email `support@tallyfy.com`).
3. Provide the following information:
    * Your organization's legal name.
    * Name, email, and phone number of the Tallyfy account owner or bill payer.
    * Your organization's mailing address.
    * Your organization's website address.
    * A short description of your organization's mission.
    * Proof of your non-profit/charitable status (e.g., determination letter, registration certificate).
</Steps>

Tallyfy will review your application. If approved, we will give you a special discount code to use when you sign up for or upgrade to a paid **annual** plan.

## Important Notes

*   The discount only applies to **annual** plans, not monthly plans.
*   Discounts cannot be applied retroactively. We don't offer refunds for payments made *before* your non-profit discount is approved and applied.
*   Tallyfy determines eligibility and reserves the right to approve or deny applications, and to change the eligibility rules.
