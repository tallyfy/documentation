## What is Tallyfy's nonprofit discount?

Tallyfy offers a permanent discount for qualifying nonprofit and charitable organizations. Contact Tallyfy for current rates.

## Who's eligible?

Your organization needs official charitable status from a government tax authority - like IRS 501(c)(3) in the US or equivalent international certification.

These categories are **ineligible**:

*   Political advocacy and lobbying organizations
*   Religious institutions and congregations
*   Educational institutions
*   Government agencies
*   Public opinion research organizations
*   Healthcare facilities and medical insurance providers
*   Private foundations

Organizations that practice discrimination or require specific religious affiliations for service access are also ineligible.
