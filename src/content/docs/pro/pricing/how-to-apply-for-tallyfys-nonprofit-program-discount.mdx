## Nonprofit organization discount program

Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> provides a **20% permanent discount** on annual subscriptions for qualifying nonprofit and charitable organizations committed to social impact initiatives.

*   Faith-based institutions and religious congregations.
*   Educational institutions including academic establishments.
*   Government agencies.
*   Public opinion research and influence organizations.
*   Healthcare facilities and medical insurance providers.
*   Private foundations.

Organizations practicing discrimination or mandating specific religious affiliations for service access remain ineligible for discount consideration.

Eligibility determination rests with Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> evaluation processes. Organizations uncertain about qualification status should consult support teams before application submission.
