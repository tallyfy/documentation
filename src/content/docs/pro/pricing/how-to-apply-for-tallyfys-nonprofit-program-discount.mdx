## What are the nonprofit eligibility criteria?

Qualifying organizations require official charitable status recognition from governmental tax authorities (such as IRS 501(c)(3) designation in the United States or equivalent international certifications).

Several organizational categories remain **ineligible** for this nonprofit pricing program:

*   Political advocacy and legislative influence organizations.
*   Faith-based institutions and religious congregations.
*   Educational institutions including academic establishments.
*   Government agencies.
*   Public opinion research and influence organizations.
*   Healthcare facilities and medical insurance providers.
*   Private foundations.

Organizations practicing discrimination or mandating specific religious affiliations for service access remain ineligible for discount consideration.

Eligibility determination rests with Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> evaluation processes. Organizations uncertain about qualification status should consult support teams before application submission.

## What is the application process for nonprofit pricing?

Organizations meeting nonprofit eligibility requirements should follow these application procedures:
