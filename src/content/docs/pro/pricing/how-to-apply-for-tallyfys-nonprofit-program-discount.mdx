## What is Tallyfy's nonprofit organization discount program?

Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> provides a **20% permanent discount** on annual subscriptions for qualifying nonprofit and charitable organizations committed to social impact initiatives.

## What are the nonprofit eligibility criteria?

Qualifying organizations require official charitable status recognition from governmental tax authorities (such as IRS 501(c)(3) designation in the United States or equivalent international certifications).

Several organizational categories remain **ineligible** for this nonprofit pricing program:

*   Political advocacy and legislative influence organizations.
*   Faith-based institutions and religious congregations.
*   Educational institutions including academic establishments.
*   Government agencies.
*   Public opinion research and influence organizations.
*   Healthcare facilities and medical insurance providers.
*   Private foundations.

Organizations practicing discrimination or mandating specific religious affiliations for service access remain ineligible for discount consideration.

Eligibility determination rests with Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> evaluation processes. Organizations uncertain about qualification status should consult support teams before application submission.

## What is the application process for nonprofit pricing?

Organizations meeting nonprofit eligibility requirements should follow these application procedures:

<Steps>
1. Establish active Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> account credentials through [tallyfy.com/start/](https://tallyfy.com/start/). Locate your [Organization ID](/products/pro/miscellaneous/how-to-find-your-tallyfy-ids/) for application purposes.
2. Initiate contact with Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> support channels (help interface or direct email `support@tallyfy.com`).

    * Complete legal organizational designation.
    * Account administrator contact details including name, email, and telephone information.
    * Official organizational mailing address.
    * Primary organizational website URL.
    * Concise organizational mission statement summary.
    * Official nonprofit status documentation (determination letters, registration certificates, or equivalent governmental certifications).
</Steps>

Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> conducts comprehensive application reviews. Upon approval, organizations receive specialized discount codes applicable to paid **annual** subscription upgrades.

## What are the program terms and conditions?

*   Discount eligibility exclusively applies to **annual** subscriptions, excluding monthly billing arrangements.
*   Retroactive discount application remains unavailable. Prior payments made before nonprofit discount approval cannot receive refund adjustments.
*   Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> maintains exclusive eligibility determination authority and reserves rights to approve, deny applications, or modify program criteria.
