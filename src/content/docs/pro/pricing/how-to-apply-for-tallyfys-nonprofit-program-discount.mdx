## What is Tallyfy's nonprofit organization discount?

Tallyfy provides a permanent discount for qualifying nonprofit and charitable organizations committed to social impact initiatives. Contact Tallyfy for current discount rates.

## What are the nonprofit eligibility criteria?

Qualifying organizations require official charitable status recognition from governmental tax authorities (such as IRS 501(c)(3) designation in the United States or equivalent international certifications).

Several organizational categories remain **ineligible** for this nonprofit program:

*   Faith-based institutions and religious congregations.
*   Educational institutions including academic establishments.
*   Government agencies.
*   Public opinion research and influence organizations.
*   Healthcare facilities and medical insurance providers.
*   Private foundations.

Organizations practicing discrimination or mandating specific religious affiliations for service access remain ineligible for program consideration.

Eligibility determination rests with Tallyfy evaluation processes. Organizations uncertain about qualification status should consult support teams before application submission.
