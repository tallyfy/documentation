## Simple and transparent pricing

You can find all our pricing information at [https://tallyfy.com/pricing/](https://tallyfy.com/pricing/)

## Annual or monthly?

The first thing to decide is whether you want to pay annually or monthly. If you pay annually - you get 10 months for the price of 12 so it's about 16% cheaper.

## Full vs Light members

Every licensed user in Tallyfy is called a _member_. The only thing a light member cannot do is edit or create templates.

Light members are priced 6 times cheaper than full members.

## Need to chat?

To talk about anything else, including discounts, services, etc. - please schedule a chat with us [here](https://tallyfy.com/booking/).

## Limits on trial plans

To protect our system, we do have certain limits on trial plans - these are worth a mention:

* You cannot share public forms on trial accounts
* You have a limited set of emails per hour, per user on trial accounts. After 30 emails have been sent in a given hour to a given guest or member, you need to wait until that hourly period is up before your email limit is reset.
