## Pricing overview

Tallyfy offers transparent pricing options designed to accommodate businesses of all sizes. View the current pricing details at [https://tallyfy.com/pricing/](https://tallyfy.com/pricing/).

### Payment options

Tallyfy provides two payment frequency options:

- **Monthly billing**: Pay month-to-month with no long-term commitment
- **Annual billing**: Save approximately 16% compared to monthly billing (effectively paying for 10 months instead of 12)

### Member types and pricing

Tallyfy offers different user license types to maximize value for your organization:

| Member Type | Capabilities | Relative Cost |
|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Full Member** | Create and edit templates, launch processes, complete tasks | Standard pricing |
| **Light Member** | Launch processes, complete tasks (cannot create or edit templates) | 1/6 the cost of a Full Member |

:::note[Member allocation strategy]
For optimal cost efficiency, assign Full Member licenses only to users who need to create or modify process templates. Assign Light Member licenses to users who only need to participate in processes.
