## Pricing overview

Tallyfy offers different pricing options. For the latest details, always visit the official pricing page: [https://tallyfy.com/pricing/](https://tallyfy.com/pricing/).

### Annual vs. monthly billing

*   **Annual Billing**: Pay for a full year upfront and save about 16% compared to the monthly price.

### Member types and costs

Tallyfy has different license types for people in your organization:

| Member Type     | Annual Cost      | Key Ability                                      |
|-----------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Full Member** | See Pricing Page | Can create/edit templates & complete tasks.      |
| **Light Member**| See Pricing Page | Can complete tasks, but **cannot** create/edit templates. |

*(Note: Full Members include both Administrator and Standard roles).* 

:::tip[Save costs with roles]
Give **Full Member** licenses only to people who *need* to build or change process templates. Give **Light Member** licenses (which cost much less) to team members who only need to *take part* in processes and complete tasks.
:::

:::note[Tallyfy Analytics add-on]
*   The optional [Tallyfy Analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/) service has an additional annual cost per active member.
*   It requires an **annual** Tallyfy subscription.
*   It applies to **every** active member in your account.
:::

:::note[What's included for free?]
All paid Tallyfy plans include: Unlimited Guests, Single Sign-On (SSO), Tallyfy AI features, 1-on-1 Support calls, and a 14-day free trial. You can also [publish templates publicly](/products/pro/documenting/templates/how-to-make-my-tallyfy-template-public/) at no extra cost.

### How billing credits work

Tallyfy uses a credit system for billing on annual plans:

*   It works like a pre-paid balance.
*   When you add users or services, Tallyfy uses your credits first before charging your card.
*   You only pay for active members.
*   If you remove a member mid-year, you get pro-rated credit back for the unused time.
*   If you add a member mid-year, Tallyfy uses any available credits first.
*   Credits expire after 5 years and are not refundable.
