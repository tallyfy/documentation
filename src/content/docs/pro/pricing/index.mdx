## How does Tallyfy's workflow platform pricing work?

Tallyfy delivers flexible business process management pricing models specifically designed for scalable workflow automation across organizations of all sizes.

Our pricing structure focuses on transparency and value, letting businesses predict costs while scaling their workflow automation capabilities. Current detailed pricing information is available at the official page: https://tallyfy.com/pricing/.

### What subscription billing options does Tallyfy offer?

**Annual Subscription Benefits**: Advance payment for twelve-month subscription periods provides approximately 16% cost savings compared to monthly billing cycles.

Annual subscriptions give you budget predictability while maximizing cost efficiency for organizations committed to long-term workflow automation success.

### How does Tallyfy's license tier structure work?

Tallyfy offers differentiated user licensing models optimized for diverse organizational workflow management requirements and budget considerations.

This tiered approach lets organizations assign appropriate access levels while controlling costs effectively:

| Member Type     | Annual Cost      | Key Ability                                      |
|-----------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Full Member** | See Pricing Page | Complete template creation, editing capabilities plus comprehensive task execution access.      |
| **Light Member**| See Pricing Page | Task completion access without template development permissions, ideal for process followers. |

*(Note: Full Members include both Administrator and Standard roles).*

:::tip[Save costs with roles]
Assign **Full Member** licenses only to workflow designers who need template development capabilities. Give cost-effective **Light Member** licenses to operational staff focused solely on process execution and task completion.
:::

:::note[Tallyfy Analytics add-on]
*   The optional [Tallyfy Analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/) business intelligence service incurs supplementary annual fees per active user.
*   Analytics functionality requires **annual** Tallyfy subscription commitment.
*   It applies to **every** active member in your account.
:::

:::note[What's included for free?]
All paid Tallyfy subscriptions include: Unlimited guests, Single Sign-On authentication, AI-powered workflow features, personalized support consultations, and comprehensive 14-day evaluation periods. Extended trial access remains available through [Tallyfy support channels](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/). Public template sharing capabilities incur no additional charges.
:::

### How does Tallyfy's credit-based billing system work?

Tallyfy implements an innovative credit-based billing mechanism for annual subscriptions. This provides maximum flexibility and cost control for growing organizations.

This intelligent billing system operates as a prepaid account balance, ensuring fair and transparent pricing:

*   **Prepaid Balance System**: Functions as a credit account that manages subscription changes automatically
*   **Smart Credit Consumption**: User additions or service upgrades consume available credits before triggering new payment card charges
*   **Pay for Active Users Only**: Billing applies exclusively to active team members, eliminating waste
*   **Proportional Refunds**: Mid-subscription user removals generate proportional credit refunds for unutilized subscription periods
*   **Credit-First Additions**: Mid-term user additions prioritize existing credit consumption before generating additional charges
*   **Credit Expiration**: Credits expire after 5 years and are not refundable to maintain system integrity

### What is Tallyfy's global accessibility pricing program?

Tallyfy's Fair Price Guarantee program provides organizations in eligible countries with substantial discounts. These discounts are carefully calibrated to regional economic indicators including GDP per capita metrics.

This accessibility initiative democratizes workflow automation technology, ensuring global organizations can access enterprise-grade process management regardless of local economic conditions.

To apply:
<Steps>
1. Majority user base must maintain residence within qualified geographic regions.
2. Annual subscription commitment required for program participation.
3. Review comprehensive guidelines at the [Fair Price Guarantee portal](https://tallyfy.com/pricing/fair-price-guarantee/).
4. Complete and submit program application documentation.
5. Upon approval, receive promotional codes for checkout application.
</Steps>

**Why lifetime pricing matters**:
- **No surprise increases**: Your discounted rate never changes
- **Budget predictability**: Plan long-term without worrying about price hikes
- **Grows with you**: Add users at the same discounted rate as you scale
- **Inflation protection**: Your costs stay flat while value increases

:::caution[Payment method for Fair Price Guarantee]
Payment instruments must originate from banking institutions within qualified countries to maintain discount eligibility. For example, Indian companies must pay with Indian bank cards or accounts.

### What nonprofit organization pricing is available?

Certified nonprofit organizations may qualify for specialized pricing consideration. Comprehensive details are available through the [Nonprofit Discount program](/products/pro/pricing/how-to-apply-for-tallyfys-nonprofit-program-discount/) documentation.

### What about free or trial options?

Tallyfy offers several options for organizations exploring workflow automation or with limited budgets:

**Free Plan Options**:
- **14-day free trial**: Full feature access for evaluation (extendable through support)
- **Free downgrade option**: Available for cost-conscious users who need basic functionality
- **Trial extension**: Contact support to extend your evaluation period if needed

**How to downgrade to free**:
If subscription costs become challenging, contact support to discuss downgrading to a free account rather than canceling entirely. This preserves your data and templates while reducing costs.

:::tip[Before canceling]
Always ask support about downgrade options first. Many users don't realize a free tier exists - downgrading keeps your work accessible while eliminating monthly costs.
