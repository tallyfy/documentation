## Simple and transparent pricing

You can find all our pricing information at [https://tallyfy.com/pricing/](https://tallyfy.com/pricing/)

## Annual or monthly?

The first thing to decide is whether you want to pay annually or monthly. If you pay annually - you get 10 months for the price of 12 so it's about 16% cheaper.

## Full vs Light members

Every licensed user in Tallyfy is called a _member_. The only thing a light member cannot do is edit or create templates.

Light members are priced 6 times cheaper than full members.
