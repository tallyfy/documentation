### Credit system

Tallyfy utilizes a credit system for billing that functions like a bank account balance:

- Credits are used before charging your backup payment card
- You only pay for active members
- Credits have a 5-year expiration
- Credits can be used for licenses and add-ons, but not services
- Credits are not refundable as cash
- Credits are available for purchase via ACH/wire transfer

When members are disabled or role changes occur, pro-rated credits are applied to your account:

- **Real-time adjustments**: Billing adjusts immediately when member roles change
- **Pro-rated credits**: When downgrading or disabling members, unused days are credited to your account
- **Credit application**: When upgrading, available credits are applied before charging your card
