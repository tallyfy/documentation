## Pricing overview

Tallyfy's pricing is transparent and predictable. As an [independent, sustainable company](/products/pro/miscellaneous/about-tallyfy/), we don't do surprise price increases. See current pricing at https://tallyfy.com/pricing/.

### Annual vs. monthly billing

Annual subscriptions cost less per month than monthly billing. You also get budget predictability by paying for 12 months upfront.

### Member tiers

Tallyfy has two member types so you can control costs by matching access levels to what people actually need:

| Member Type     | Key Ability                                      |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Full Member** | Create and edit templates, plus complete tasks. |
| **Light Member**| Complete assigned tasks only - can't create or edit templates. |

Full Members include both Administrator and Standard roles.

:::tip[Save costs with roles]
Only give **Full Member** licenses to people who design workflows. Everyone else can use cheaper **Light Member** licenses to complete tasks.
:::

:::note[Tallyfy Analytics add-on]
*   The optional [Tallyfy Analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/) add-on has separate annual fees per active user.
*   Analytics requires an **annual** Tallyfy subscription.
*   It applies to **every** active member in your account.
:::

:::note[What's included for free?]
All paid Tallyfy subscriptions include: unlimited guests, Single Sign-On (SSO), AI-powered workflow features, support consultations, and a 14-day trial. You can request a trial extension through [Tallyfy support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/). Sharing public templates is also free.
:::

### Credit-based billing

Annual subscriptions use a credit-based billing system through Recurly. It works like a prepaid balance:

*   **Prepaid credits** - your subscription creates a credit balance that covers changes automatically
*   **Credits used first** - adding users or upgrading consumes existing credits before charging your card
*   **Active users only** - you're only billed for active team members
*   **Proportional refunds** - removing a user mid-cycle refunds unused time as credits
*   **Credit expiration** - credits expire per billing terms and aren't refundable

### Fair Price Guarantee

Tallyfy's Fair Price Guarantee gives organizations in eligible countries discounts based on regional GDP per capita.

To apply:
<Steps>
1. Most of your users must be in a qualifying country.
2. You need an annual subscription.
3. Review guidelines at the [Fair Price Guarantee portal](https://tallyfy.com/pricing/fair-price-guarantee/).
4. Submit your application.
5. If approved, you'll get promo codes for checkout.
</Steps>

**Why lifetime pricing matters**:
- **No surprise increases**: Your discounted rate never changes
- **Budget predictability**: Plan long-term without worrying about price hikes
- **Grows with you**: Add users at the same discounted rate
- **Inflation protection**: Your costs stay flat while value increases

:::caution[Payment method for Fair Price Guarantee]
Your payment method must come from a bank in a qualifying country. For example, Indian companies must pay with Indian bank cards or accounts.
:::

### Nonprofit pricing

Certified nonprofits may qualify for special pricing. See the [Nonprofit Discount program](/products/pro/pricing/how-to-apply-for-tallyfys-nonprofit-program-discount/) for details.

### Free and trial options

- **14-day free trial** - full feature access, extendable through support
- **Free plan** - if costs are a concern, contact support to downgrade instead of canceling. This keeps your data and templates intact.

:::tip[Before canceling]
Ask support about downgrade options first. Many users don't realize a free tier exists - downgrading keeps your work accessible at no cost.

*   Multilingual interface support (included)
*   AI-powered content localization (requires Azure integration, usage-based billing)
