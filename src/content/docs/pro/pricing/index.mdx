## Workflow platform pricing structure

Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> provides flexible business process management pricing models designed for scalable workflow automation. Current pricing details remain available at the official page: [https://tallyfy.com/pricing/](https://tallyfy.com/pricing/).

### Subscription billing options

*   **Annual Subscription**: Advance payment for twelve-month periods delivers approximately 16% cost savings compared to monthly billing cycles.

### License tier structure

Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> offers differentiated user licensing models optimized for various organizational workflow management needs:

| Member Type     | Annual Cost      | Key Ability                                      |
|-----------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Full Member** | See Pricing Page | Template creation, editing capabilities plus task execution.      |
| **Light Member**| See Pricing Page | Task completion access without template development permissions. |

*(Note: Full Members include both Administrator and Standard roles).*

### Credit-based billing system

*   Functions as a prepaid account balance system.
*   User additions or service upgrades consume available credits before triggering payment card charges.
*   You only pay for active members.
