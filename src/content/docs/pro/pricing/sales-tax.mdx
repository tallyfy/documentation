## Understanding sales tax for Tallyfy subscriptions

**You won't see sales tax added to your Tallyfy subscription.** We're based entirely in Missouri, where Software as a Service (SaaS) isn't subject to sales tax. Since we don't meet specific economic nexus criteria at present, we don't currently collect sales tax anywhere. Simple as that.

But let's dig into why - and what this means for you.

### Why Missouri doesn't tax SaaS

Missouri taxes tangible personal property and certain enumerated services. Remotely-accessed software? Not on that list.

The Missouri Department of Revenue treats SaaS differently from downloadable software. When you use Tallyfy, you're accessing our servers remotely. You're not downloading anything. No physical transfer happens. That distinction matters legally - it keeps SaaS in the non-taxable category.

Recent letter rulings from Missouri's tax authority confirm this position. They've consistently held that subscription-based, remote-access digital services aren't taxable as sales of tangible personal property or telecommunications services.

### What about other states?

Here's where it gets interesting. As a Missouri company, we only need to charge sales tax in other states if we hit certain thresholds - what's called "economic nexus."

Most states set their economic nexus at:
- $100,000 in sales to that state, or
- 200 separate transactions (though many states are dropping this transaction count)

Once a company crosses these thresholds, they must register with that state and start collecting sales tax - but only if that state actually taxes SaaS.

Currently, about 25 US jurisdictions tax SaaS in some form. States like New York, Texas, and Washington tax it fully. Others like California and Florida don't tax it at all. Some states, like Iowa, tax it for consumers but exempt business use.

For Tallyfy specifically: We monitor our sales by state. If we cross the threshold in a state that taxes SaaS, we'll register there and update our billing system accordingly. We'll notify affected customers well in advance.

### B2B vs B2C - does it matter?

In the US, most states that tax SaaS apply the same rules to both B2B and B2C transactions. 

A few states provide business-use exemptions, but you'd typically need to provide exemption certificates. Since Tallyfy primarily serves business customers, you might qualify for these exemptions in certain states - though again, we're not currently collecting tax anywhere.

### International sales and VAT

International tax works differently:

**European Union (EU)**:
- B2C sales: Subject to VAT at the customer's country rate
- B2B sales: Usually "reverse charged" when customers provide a valid VAT ID (meaning you handle the tax, not us)
- We'd use the Non-Union OSS scheme to simplify compliance if we start collecting

**United Kingdom (UK)**:
- B2C digital services: Subject to 20% UK VAT from the first sale
- B2B sales: Generally reverse charged with valid VAT registration

**Other countries**: Each has its own rules. Canada has GST/HST, Australia has GST, and so on.

Currently, we're not registered for VAT in any country. If this changes, we'll provide advance notice and help you understand any impacts.

### State-by-state economic nexus thresholds

Since you might be curious about when companies typically need to start collecting tax, here's a quick reference of current thresholds:

**Common thresholds ($100,000 only)**:
- Missouri, California (but at $500,000), Florida, Illinois, North Carolina

**Common thresholds ($100,000 or 200 transactions)**:
- Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Ohio, Virginia

**Higher thresholds**:
- New York: $500,000 AND 100+ transactions
- Texas: $500,000

**No sales tax states**:
- Alaska (local taxes may apply), Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, Oregon

Transaction thresholds are disappearing. As of 2025, many states have eliminated or are eliminating the 200-transaction threshold, focusing solely on dollar amounts.

### What this means for you

**For US customers**:
- No sales tax on your Tallyfy subscription currently
- If this changes, we'll notify you at least 30 days in advance
- You remain responsible for any use tax obligations in your state (consult your tax advisor)

**For international customers**:
- No VAT/GST currently charged
- B2B customers may have reverse charge obligations
- Check with your local tax authority about your responsibilities

### Future changes

Tax laws evolve constantly. States are expanding their definitions of taxable services. International agreements are harmonizing digital taxation.

We track these changes closely. Our approach:
1. Monitor our sales thresholds quarterly
2. Track legislative changes in sales tax laws
3. Register proactively when we approach thresholds
4. Communicate changes to affected customers early
5. Help you understand any impacts
