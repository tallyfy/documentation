## Using the Tallyfy Gmail Add-on

Tired of jumping between Gmail and Tallyfy all day? The Gmail add-on lets you create tasks, launch processes, and track everything - right from your inbox. No more tab switching.

### What you need

- A Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) or a standard Gmail account
- An active Tallyfy account
- Permission from your Google Workspace admin to install add-ons (if you're using a work account)
- Basic knowledge of how Tallyfy works

### Key features

- **Create tasks**: Turn any email into a Tallyfy task in 2 clicks
- **Launch processes**: Start a workflow directly from an email thread
- **Track status**: See all your tasks without leaving Gmail
- **Save time**: Cut out the constant app switching
- **Keep context**: Email content automatically links to the task you create

### How to install it

<Steps>
1. Go to the [Tallyfy Add-on page in the Google Workspace Marketplace](https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/app/tallyfy/671710262095/)
2. Click **Install**
3. Grant the permissions (Gmail needs to connect with your Tallyfy account)
4. Look for the Tallyfy icon in Gmail's right sidebar - that's it!
</Steps>

### Troubleshooting tips

| Problem                 | Possible Solution                                    |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Tallyfy icon missing    | Refresh Gmail, then clear your browser cache         |
| Can't sign in          | Sign out of the add-on completely, then sign back in |
| Can't create tasks      | You might be a Light user - check your Tallyfy permissions |
| Add-on is slow         | Usually it's your connection - try refreshing       |

### Where it works

The add-on runs great on the Gmail website (desktop or laptop). Mobile Gmail app? It works there too - though you'll get the full experience on desktop.
