- Permission from your Google Workspace admin to install add-ons (for work accounts)

### Key features

- **Create Task** - turn any email into a Tallyfy task with the subject and body pre-filled
- **My Tasks** - view, edit, and complete your assigned tasks without leaving Gmail
- **Start Process** - pick a template and launch a workflow from any email
- **Link Email to Task** - attach a Gmail thread to an existing Tallyfy task as a comment

### Creating a task from an email

<Steps>
1. Click **Create Task** on the dashboard
2. The task name auto-fills from the email subject, and the details field pulls in the email body
3. Set a deadline using natural language (e.g., "Tomorrow night", "May 6th at 5:30pm")
4. Assign the task to a team member or guest
5. Click **Create**
</Steps>

### Starting a process from an email

<Steps>
1. Click **Start Process** on the dashboard
2. Select a template from the dropdown
3. Fill in any kick-off form fields
4. Click **Continue** to launch
</Steps>

Templates on a Docs plan won't appear here - you need a Basic or Pro plan to start processes.

### Checking your tasks

<Steps>
1. Click **My Tasks** on the dashboard
2. Your active tasks appear with **View**, **Edit**, and **Complete** buttons on each
3. Use **Prev** / **Next** to page through results
4. Click **View in browser** to open Tallyfy's full task view
</Steps>

### Linking an email to a task

This lets you post a Gmail thread as a formatted comment on any existing task.

<Steps>
1. Click **Link Email to Task** on the dashboard
2. Select a template, then a running process, then a specific task
3. The email thread (subject, sender, body) gets posted as a comment on that task
</Steps>

### Troubleshooting

| Problem                 | Fix                                                  |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Tallyfy icon missing    | Refresh Gmail and clear your browser cache           |
| Can't sign in           | Sign out of the add-on completely, then sign back in |
| Can't create tasks      | Check your Tallyfy permissions - Light users have limits |
| Add-on is slow          | Try refreshing - it's usually a connection issue     |

### Where it works

The add-on works on desktop Gmail and the mobile Gmail app. Desktop gives the fullest experience.
