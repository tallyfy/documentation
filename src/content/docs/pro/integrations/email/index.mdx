## Email Integration Options

Tallyfy provides multiple ways to integrate with email systems, enhancing communication between team members and external stakeholders throughout your workflows.

### Custom SMTP configuration

Configure Tallyfy to use your organization's email servers instead of the default Tallyfy mail service. Benefits include:

- **Consistent branding** - Emails appear from your company domain
- **Enhanced deliverability** - Leverage your existing email reputation
- **Security compliance** - Keep communications within your infrastructure
- **Email filtering control** - Apply your organizational email policies

:::caution[Email Reply Limitation]
When using custom SMTP, emails will not be "replyable" for comments. This means that the custom "From" addresses that normally allow users to reply to an email and have that reply automatically inserted as a comment in the task will not function. Any replies to emails sent via custom SMTP will not be captured in Tallyfy.

### Gmail Add-on integration

The Tallyfy Gmail add-on enables direct workflow interaction from within your Gmail inbox:

- Launch processes directly from emails
- Create tasks based on email content
- Track workflow progress without leaving Gmail
- Streamline communication workflows

### Email notification management

Tallyfy provides granular control over which workflow events trigger email notifications, allowing each user to customize their notification preferences based on their specific needs.
