## Email integration options

Tallyfy connects with email in several ways - custom SMTP, a Gmail add-on, automated notifications, interactive actions (coming soon), and personalized email sending (coming soon).

Your team already lives in email. These integrations bring Tallyfy's workflow capabilities directly into the inbox.

### Custom SMTP configuration

Tallyfy lets you configure a custom SMTP server so all workflow notifications come from your own domain (e.g. yourcompany.com) instead of Tallyfy's servers. You'll need to provide SMTP host, port, username, password, and optionally a from address and from name.

#### Why use custom SMTP?
- **Branding** - Emails come from your company domain, keeping your brand consistent.
- **Deliverability** - Uses your organization's established email reputation.
- **Compliance** - Keeps email communication within your company's controlled systems.
- **Filtering** - Works with your organization's existing email rules and security policies.

:::caution[Replying to emails won't add comments]
Normally, users can reply to a Tallyfy email notification and their reply automatically becomes a comment on the task. If you use custom SMTP, this reply-by-email feature **won't work**. Replies go to the SMTP sender address but won't be added as comments in Tallyfy.
:::

*(Setting up custom SMTP requires technical details from your IT team. See the [Custom SMTP setup guide](/products/pro/integrations/email/how-to-set-up-custom-smtp-in-tallyfy/).)*

### Tallyfy Gmail add-on

The Tallyfy [Gmail add-on](/products/pro/integrations/email/how-can-i-manage-my-tasks-with-tallyfys-gmail-add-on/) lets you manage workflows without leaving Gmail.

- **Start processes** - Launch a process directly from an email.
- **Email-to-task conversion** - Turn an email into a trackable task with deadlines and assignments.
- **Task management** - View and complete your tasks right inside Gmail.

### Managing email notifications

Tallyfy notifies you about task assignments, comments, and process updates - but you control the flow. Each person sets their own notification preferences (daily digest, instant, or off completely).

See [Manage email notifications](/products/pro/settings/personal-settings/how-can-i-manage-email-notifications-in-tallyfy/) to customize your settings.

### Interactive email actions (coming soon)

Imagine getting a Tallyfy notification about an approval task and hitting "Approve" right in the email - without opening the app. That's what [interactive email actions](/products/pro/integrations/interactive-email-actions/) will enable. Microsoft Outlook calls them Actionable Messages, Gmail calls them Markup Actions. You'll be able to approve tasks, add comments, and complete simple actions directly from your email client.

### Connect your email (coming soon)

This upcoming feature will let individual users [connect their personal email accounts](/products/pro/integrations/email/connect-your-email/) (Gmail or Outlook) to send workflow emails from their own address. Unlike custom SMTP - which uses one centralized system email for the whole organization - this creates a one-to-one connection between each user and their email account.

When Sarah assigns you a task, you'd see it coming from sarah@yourcompany.com, not from notifications@yourcompany.com.
