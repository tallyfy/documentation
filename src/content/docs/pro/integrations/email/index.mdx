## What email integration options does Tallyfy provide?

Tallyfy connects with your email in four powerful ways - custom SMTP, Gmail add-on, automated notifications, and interactive actions (coming soon). You'll cut context switching by 80% and keep everything in one workflow.

Here's the thing: your team already lives in email. Why force them somewhere else? These integrations bring Tallyfy's workflow power directly into the inbox they check 20 times a day.

### How can I use custom SMTP with Tallyfy?

Want your workflow emails to come from your own domain? Tallyfy lets you configure custom SMTP servers, which means all notifications come from yourcompany.com instead of Tallyfy's servers.

This isn't just about branding. You get total control over email delivery, plus everything stays within your IT team's existing security setup.

#### Why implement custom SMTP?
- **Professional Branding**: Emails come directly from your company domain, keeping your brand consistent.
- **Better Deliverability**: Uses your organization's established email reputation and delivery infrastructure.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Keeps all email communication within your company's controlled systems and compliance frameworks.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Uses your organization's existing email rules, security filters, and governance policies.

:::caution[Replying to Emails Won't Add Comments]
Normally, users can reply to a Tallyfy email notification, and their reply automatically becomes a comment on the task. If you use Custom SMTP, this reply-by-email feature **will not work**. Replies will go to the sender but won't be added as comments in Tallyfy.
:::

*(Setting up Custom SMTP requires technical details from your IT team. See the [Custom SMTP Setup Guide](/products/pro/integrations/email/how-to-set-up-custom-smtp-in-tallyfy/) - Note: This guide is technical).* 

### What is the Tallyfy Gmail Add-on?

The Tallyfy [Gmail add-on](/products/pro/integrations/email/how-can-i-manage-my-tasks-with-tallyfys-gmail-add-on/) transforms your inbox into a workflow command center. No more tab switching.

- **Start Processes**: Got an email that needs action? Launch a process from it in 2 clicks.
- **Email-to-Task Conversion**: Convert that "Can you handle this?" email into a trackable task with deadlines and assignments.
- **Integrated Task Management**: See all your tasks right in Gmail - check them off without leaving your inbox.

### How can I manage Tallyfy email notifications?

Too many emails? Not enough? Tallyfy notifies you about task assignments, comments, and process updates - but you control the flow. Each person sets their own notification preferences (daily digest, instant, or off completely).

Check [Manage Email Notifications](/products/pro/settings/personal-settings/how-can-i-manage-email-notifications-in-tallyfy/) to customize your settings.

### What are Interactive Email Actions in development?

Picture this: you get a Tallyfy notification about an approval task. Instead of clicking through to the app, you just hit "Approve" right in the email. Done.

That's what we're building with [interactive email actions](/products/pro/integrations/interactive-email-actions/). Microsoft Outlook calls them Actionable Messages, Gmail calls them Markup Actions - we call them a huge timesaver. You'll approve tasks, add comments, and complete simple actions without ever leaving your email client. We're testing this now and can't wait to release it.
