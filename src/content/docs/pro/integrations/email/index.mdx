## What email integration options does Tallyfy provide?

Tallyfy offers complete email integration that seriously improves workflow communication and task management through multiple connection methods.

These smart email integrations streamline workflow notifications, enable professional custom branding, and let you manage tasks directly within the email platforms your team uses every day.

### How can I use custom SMTP with Tallyfy?

Tallyfy supports advanced custom SMTP configuration enabling organizations to send all workflow emails through their own dedicated email servers rather than Tallyfy's default infrastructure.

Custom SMTP setup gives you complete control over email delivery while keeping everything consistent with your existing corporate email systems and branding.

#### Why implement custom SMTP?
- **Professional Branding**: Emails come directly from your company domain, keeping your brand consistent.
- **Better Deliverability**: Uses your organization's established email reputation and delivery infrastructure.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Keeps all email communication within your company's controlled systems and compliance frameworks.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Uses your organization's existing email rules, security filters, and governance policies.

:::caution[Replying to Emails Won't Add Comments]
Normally, users can reply to a Tallyfy email notification, and their reply automatically becomes a comment on the task. If you use Custom SMTP, this reply-by-email feature **will not work**. Replies will go to the sender but won't be added as comments in Tallyfy.
:::

*(Setting up Custom SMTP requires technical details from your IT team. See the [Custom SMTP Setup Guide](/products/pro/integrations/email/how-to-set-up-custom-smtp-in-tallyfy/) - Note: This guide is technical).* 

### What is the Tallyfy Gmail Add-on?

The Tallyfy [Gmail add-on](/products/pro/integrations/email/how-can-i-manage-my-tasks-with-tallyfys-gmail-add-on/) lets you manage Tallyfy workflows right within your Gmail inbox.

- **Start Processes**: Launch Tallyfy processes directly from existing email messages.
- **Email-to-Task Conversion**: Turn incoming emails into structured Tallyfy tasks for proper workflow tracking.
- **Integrated Task Management**: View and manage your complete task list without leaving Gmail.

### How can I manage Tallyfy email notifications?

Tallyfy sends automated email notifications for various workflow events including task assignments, comments, and process updates. Each user has detailed control over notification frequency through their personal notification preferences. See [Manage Email Notifications](/products/pro/settings/personal-settings/how-can-i-manage-email-notifications-in-tallyfy/) for detailed configuration instructions.

### What are Interactive Email Actions in development?

Tallyfy is actively exploring advanced capabilities to enhance email notifications through [interactive email actions](/products/pro/integrations/interactive-email-actions/). This innovative technology, supported by platforms like Microsoft Outlook (Actionable Messages) and Gmail (Gmail Markup Actions), would let users perform essential Tallyfy actions - like approving tasks or adding quick comments - directly within email messages without needing to navigate to the Tallyfy app. This development shows our ongoing commitment to streamlining workflows and reducing disruptive context switching for better productivity.
