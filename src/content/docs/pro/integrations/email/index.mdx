## Email Integration Options

Tallyfy uses email in several ways to help you communicate and manage your workflows.

### Using Your Own Email Server (Custom SMTP)

You can set up Tallyfy to send emails (like task notifications) using your company's own email servers instead of Tallyfy's default.

**Why do this?**
- **Branding**: Emails look like they come directly from your company.
- **Deliverability**: Uses your company's existing email reputation.
- **Compliance**: Keeps email communication within your company's systems.
- **Filtering**: Apply your company's email rules and filters.

:::caution[Replying to Emails Won't Add Comments]
Normally, users can reply to a Tallyfy email notification, and their reply automatically becomes a comment on the task. If you use Custom SMTP, this reply-by-email feature **will not work**. Replies will go to the sender but won't be added as comments in Tallyfy.
:::

*(Setting up Custom SMTP requires technical details from your IT team. See the [Custom SMTP Setup Guide](/products/pro/integrations/email/how-to-set-up-custom-smtp-in-tallyfy/) - Note: This guide is technical).* 

### Gmail Add-on

The Tallyfy [Gmail add-on](/products/pro/integrations/email/how-can-i-manage-my-tasks-with-tallyfys-gmail-add-on/) lets you work with Tallyfy directly inside your Gmail inbox.

- Start Tallyfy processes from emails.
- Turn emails into Tallyfy tasks.
- Check your task list without leaving Gmail.

### Managing Email Notifications

Tallyfy sends email notifications for various events (like task assignments or comments). Each user can control how many emails they receive by adjusting their personal notification settings. See [Manage Email Notifications](/products/pro/settings/personal-settings/how-can-i-manage-email-notifications-in-tallyfy/).
