## Setting up a custom SMTP server for all outgoing email

Tallyfy lets you set your own SMTP server as a central account to send all emails. This is a substitute for our own email server sending emails from Tallyfy to your coworkers, guests, etc.

The benefits of custom SMTP are:

* All email sends via your own servers. This minimizes the chance of emails being blocked, or being seen as phishing or spam emails by receiving mailboxes.
* It gives you a log of sent items on your end - assuming you log SMTP usage on your servers.
* It uses/applies everything you've already set up and configured on your own SMTP servers.

:::note[Note]

Tallyfy currently requires you to use a single central account like "tallyfy@company.com" instead of individual accounts to send emails. We don't support individual accounts right now.
