## Why use custom SMTP?

Custom SMTP lets every workflow email come from your domain instead of Tallyfy's. Your SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records stay intact, deliverability improves, and recipients see your brand - not ours.

Other benefits:

- **Server-level tracking** - access your own logs for all outbound Tallyfy emails
- **Security compliance** - email traffic stays within your existing infrastructure
- **Consistent reputation** - your domain's sender score applies to workflow notifications

:::caution[Email reply limitation]
Custom SMTP disables reply-to-comment. When someone replies to a task notification, the response goes to your inbox - it won't appear as a comment in Tallyfy.
:::

:::note[Single account only]
Tallyfy uses one central email account (e.g. `tallyfy@company.com`) for all outgoing mail. Individual user accounts aren't supported for SMTP sending.

### What you'll need

| Parameter | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| SMTP Server Host | smtp.company.com |
| Port | 587 |
| Username (email format) | tallyfy@company.com |
| Password | Your SMTP password |
| From Email (optional) | workflows@company.com |
| From Name (optional) | Company Workflows |

Tallyfy uses TLS encryption automatically - there's no encryption dropdown to configure.

### Configuration steps

<Steps>
1. Sign in with an administrator account.
2. Go to **Settings** > **Email Settings** in the organization settings sidebar.
3. Toggle on **Send all emails via your SMTP server**.
4. Enter your **Host** and **Port**.
5. Enter your **Username** (must be a valid email address) and **Password**.
6. Optionally fill in **From Name** and **From Email Address**.

7. Click **TEST & CONNECT**. Tallyfy verifies your connection and saves the configuration in one step.
</Steps>

If the connection test fails, you'll see an error message with details. Fix the issue and try again - nothing gets saved until the test passes.

### Testing with external tools

Before going live, you can verify your SMTP server independently using these third-party tools:

- [Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer](https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/tests/OutboundSMTP/input/) - thorough SMTP connectivity check

:::caution[External tools]
These are third-party services. Consider using temporary test credentials if you're concerned about sharing SMTP passwords with external sites.

### Verifying it works end-to-end

<Steps>
1. Open any template and launch a test process with yourself assigned.
2. Check your inbox for the task notification email.
3. Confirm the "From" address matches your configured sender.
4. Inspect email headers to verify the message routed through your SMTP server.
</Steps>

### Troubleshooting

| Issue | Likely cause | Fix |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| Connection timeout | Firewall blocking port 587 | Open outbound SMTP port |
| Authentication failure | Wrong credentials | Double-check username (must be email format) and password |
| TLS errors | Server doesn't support TLS | Confirm your server supports TLS on the specified port |
| Rate limiting | Too many connections | Raise server limits or reduce email volume |
| DNS resolution failure | Bad hostname | Verify the SMTP host address resolves correctly |
| Rejected messages | Sender mismatch | Ensure "From" address matches an authorized domain |

#### If you're still stuck

**Network**: Your firewall must allow outbound connections from Tallyfy's servers to your SMTP host on port 587. Test with telnet or openssl.

**Authentication**: Some mail servers require app-specific passwords when MFA is enabled. Check whether your server accepts the authentication method Tallyfy uses.

**DNS and email security**: Your SPF record must include your SMTP server's IP. If you use DKIM and DMARC, make sure they're configured correctly for the sending domain.

:::tip[Best practice]
After setup, send test emails to Gmail, Outlook, and Yahoo. You'll catch deliverability issues before your team does.
