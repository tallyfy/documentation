## Custom SMTP Server Configuration

Tallyfy allows you to configure your own SMTP server to handle all outbound email communications. This guide explains how to set up and test a custom SMTP server for your Tallyfy organization.

### Requirements

Before configuring custom SMTP in Tallyfy, ensure you have:

- Administrator access to your Tallyfy organization
- SMTP server details from your IT department or email service provider
- Authentication credentials for your SMTP server
- Verified that your email server allows third-party application connections
- Confirmed your organization's email security policies permit this integration

### Benefits of custom SMTP

Using your own SMTP server with Tallyfy provides several advantages:

- **Improved deliverability** - Emails sent from your domain are less likely to be flagged as spam or phishing attempts
- **Tracking** - Access server logs for all outbound emails sent through Tallyfy
- **Consistent branding** - Maintain your company's email reputation and formatting
- **Security compliance** - Keep sensitive email traffic within your existing security framework
- **Existing configurations** - Leverage your existing SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records
- **White-labeled communications** - Ensure all workflow emails appear from your domain

:::caution[Email Reply Limitation]
When using custom SMTP, emails will not be "replyable" for comments. This means that the custom "From" addresses that normally allow users to reply to an email and have that reply automatically inserted as a comment in the task will not function. Any replies to emails sent via custom SMTP will not be captured in Tallyfy.
:::

:::note[Single Account Limitation]
Tallyfy currently requires using a single central email account (e.g., "tallyfy@company.com") for all outgoing emails. Individual user email accounts are not supported at this time.
:::

### Required SMTP information

Gather these details before proceeding with configuration:

| Parameter | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| SMTP Server Host | Your mail server address | smtp.company.com |
| SMTP Port | Port for mail submission | 587 (TLS) or 465 (SSL) |
| Username | Account for authentication | tallyfy@company.com |
| Password | Authentication credential | Your secure password |
| From Email | Sender's email address | workflows@company.com |
| From Name | Display name for sender | Company Workflows |
| Encryption Method | Security protocol | TLS or SSL |

### Configuration steps

### Testing SMTP configuration

Before implementing custom SMTP in Tallyfy, verify your settings using these external testing tools:

#### Microsoft Remote Connectivity Analyzer

This official Microsoft tool helps verify SMTP connectivity:

1. Visit the [Outbound SMTP Email test](https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/tests/OutboundSMTP/input/)
2. Enter your SMTP server details and credentials
3. Run the test to verify connectivity and authentication
4. Review detailed results for any connectivity issues

#### Wormly SMTP Tester

Wormly provides a simple SMTP server testing tool:

1. Navigate to [Wormly's SMTP server test](https://www.wormly.com/test-smtp-server/)
2. Enter your server hostname and port
3. Complete the test to verify basic connectivity
4. Check for open ports and server responsiveness

:::caution[External Tools]
These testing tools are third-party services not affiliated with Tallyfy. Use caution when entering sensitive credentials in external tools. Consider creating temporary test credentials when possible.
:::

### Verifying successful configuration

After setting up custom SMTP, confirm it's working correctly:

<Steps>
1. Navigate to a process template in Tallyfy
2. Launch a test process with yourself as an assignee
3. Check that you receive the task notification email
4. Verify the email appears from your configured address
5. Examine email headers to confirm it was sent via your SMTP server
</Steps>

### Troubleshooting SMTP issues

#### Common problems and solutions

| Issue | Possible Causes | Solutions |
|-------|----------------|-----------|
| Connection timeout | Firewall blocking traffic | Open outbound ports for SMTP traffic |
| Authentication failure | Incorrect credentials | Verify username and password format |
| SSL/TLS errors | Wrong encryption setting | Try alternative encryption method |
| Rate limiting | Too many connections | Increase server limits or optimize email volume |
| DNS resolution failure | Incorrect server hostname | Verify the SMTP host address |
| Rejected messages | Malformed headers | Check "From" address matches authorized sender |

#### Additional troubleshooting steps

If you encounter problems with your SMTP configuration:

##### 1. Network connectivity
   - Verify that your firewall allows outbound connections from Tallyfy to your SMTP server
   - Confirm that the SMTP port (587 or 465) is open for outbound traffic
   - Test basic connectivity using telnet or similar tools

##### 2. Authentication issues
   - Ensure the SMTP account has sufficient permissions to send email
   - Verify that your mail server allows the authentication method being used
   - Check if multi-factor authentication is interfering with connection

##### 3. Rate limits and volume
   - Check that any rate limits on your SMTP server accommodate your Tallyfy email volume
   - Consider implementing sending queues if you have high email volume

##### 4. DNS and email security
   - Confirm that your SPF record includes your SMTP server's IP address
   - Verify DKIM and DMARC configurations if applicable
   - Ensure the "From" address domain matches the authenticated domain

:::tip[Best Practice]
After configuration, send test emails to addresses at different mail providers (Gmail, Outlook, etc.) to verify delivery across various platforms.
