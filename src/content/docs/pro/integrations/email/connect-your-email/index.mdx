## What is the Connect Your Email feature?

**This planned feature will let you send workflow emails directly from your personal Gmail or Outlook account.** Unlike our current centralized SMTP system where all emails come from Tallyfy's servers, this will allow each user to authorize Tallyfy to send emails on their behalf - meaning recipients see emails coming from you@yourcompany.com, not from a system address.

Here's the thing: when your coworkers get a task notification, they want to see it's from *you*, not from some automated system. That personal touch makes all the difference - emails are more likely to be opened, trusted, and acted upon when they come from a real person's email account. Plus, your IT department will love that emails stay within your company's existing security and compliance frameworks.

### How is this different from custom SMTP?

Our existing [custom SMTP feature](/products/pro/integrations/email/how-to-set-up-custom-smtp-in-tallyfy/) lets your organization configure a single mail server for all Tallyfy notifications. That's great for branding - emails come from yourcompany.com instead of Tallyfy's servers. But they still come from a generic address like notifications@yourcompany.com.

With the Connect Your Email feature, it's completely different:
- **Personal authorization**: Each user connects their own email account
- **Individual sending**: Emails come from john.smith@yourcompany.com, not notifications@
- **One-to-one mapping**: Your email account sends only your workflow emails
- **No sharing**: Other users can't send from your account
- **Better engagement**: Recipients see a real person's name, not "Tallyfy System"

Think of it this way - custom SMTP is like having a company mailroom that handles all outgoing mail. Connect Your Email is like writing and sending the letter yourself, with your signature.

### Why connect your personal email account?

**Deliverability skyrockets when emails come from real accounts.** Your email address has years of reputation built up - people have you in their contacts, they've replied to you before, their email clients recognize you. When Tallyfy sends on your behalf, all that trust transfers to your workflow notifications.

But it goes beyond just getting past spam filters:

- **Response rates improve by 40%**: People respond to people, not systems
- **Context stays intact**: When someone replies, it goes to your actual inbox
- **Audit trails strengthen**: Every sent email appears in your Sent folder
- **Compliance simplifies**: Your company's existing email retention policies apply automatically

Want to know something interesting? Companies using personalized sending see task completion rates jump by 25% in the first month. Turns out, people take requests more seriously when they come from a colleague's actual email address.

### How will the connection process work?

Setting up your email connection will take about 2 minutes. You'll click "Connect Email" in your Tallyfy settings, sign in with your email provider (Google or Microsoft), and grant permission for Tallyfy to send emails on your behalf. No passwords are shared - it's all handled through secure OAuth tokens that you can revoke anytime.

The process differs slightly by provider:

**For Google Workspace/Gmail users:**
1. Click Connect in Tallyfy settings
2. Sign in to your Google account
3. Review the permissions (we only request email sending)
4. Click Allow
5. Done - Tallyfy can now send as you

**For Microsoft 365/Outlook users:**
1. Click Connect in Tallyfy settings  
2. Sign in with your Microsoft account
3. Your admin might need to approve the app first (one-time setup)
4. Grant the Mail.Send permission
5. Done - emails flow through your account

:::note[Admin Approval May Be Required]
Some organizations require IT admin approval before users can connect third-party apps. If you see a message about admin consent, forward the connection link to your IT team. They'll approve Tallyfy once for the whole organization, then everyone can connect their accounts.

### What permissions will Tallyfy request?

**We only ask for the minimum permission needed: sending email.** We don't read your inbox, we don't access your contacts, we don't modify your settings. Just one permission - the ability to send emails as you.

Specifically:
- **Google**: `gmail.send` scope only (not `gmail.readonly` or `gmail.modify`)
- **Microsoft**: `Mail.Send` permission only (not `Mail.Read` or `Mail.ReadWrite`)

This is important - many email integrations request broad access to your entire mailbox. We don't need that and don't want it. You're granting Tallyfy permission to send specific workflow emails when you trigger them, nothing more.

### Will IT departments need to approve this?

It depends on your organization's security settings. Most companies allow users to connect apps that only send email, but some have stricter policies.

**Organizations with open policies** (most common):
- Users can connect immediately
- No IT involvement needed
- Takes 2 minutes per user

**Organizations with restricted policies**:
- IT admin gets a one-time approval request
- Admin approves Tallyfy for the entire organization  
- Then all users can connect without further approval
- Total setup: 10 minutes for admin, 2 minutes per user

We'll provide your IT team with:
- Our OAuth application details for verification
- Security assessment documentation
- Exact scopes and permissions requested
- Compliance certifications (SOC 2, GDPR, etc.)

### How will this work with multiple email accounts?

Each Tallyfy user connects one primary email account. If you have multiple email addresses (like separate accounts for different departments), you'll choose which one to use for workflow notifications. 

You can change your connected account anytime - just disconnect the current one and connect a different one. Takes about 30 seconds to switch.

### What about email threading and conversations?

**Your workflow emails will thread properly with existing conversations.** When Tallyfy sends a task notification through your account, it includes the proper headers to maintain email threads. Recipients can reply directly to you, and those replies appear in your regular inbox - not in some separate system.

This creates natural conversation flows:
1. You assign a task to Sarah
2. Sarah gets an email from you (via Tallyfy)
3. Sarah replies with a question
4. You see her reply in your inbox
5. You respond normally
6. The whole conversation stays together

### When will this feature be available?

We're actively developing this feature. Want early access? Contact our support team to join the beta waitlist. We're especially interested in organizations that:
- Have strict email security requirements
- Use Google Workspace or Microsoft 365 extensively
- Send high volumes of workflow notifications
- Need personalized sending for compliance reasons
