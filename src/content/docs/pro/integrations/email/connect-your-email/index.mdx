## What is Connect Your Email?

**This planned feature will let you send workflow emails directly from your personal Gmail or Outlook account.** Instead of all emails coming from Tallyfy's servers, each user will authorize Tallyfy to send on their behalf - so recipients see emails from you@yourcompany.com, not a system address.

When coworkers get a task notification from *you* rather than an automated system, they're more likely to open it, trust it, and act on it. Your IT department also benefits - emails stay within your company's existing security and compliance setup.

### How is this different from custom SMTP?

The existing [custom SMTP feature](/products/pro/integrations/email/how-to-set-up-custom-smtp-in-tallyfy/) lets your organization configure a single mail server for all Tallyfy notifications. That's good for branding - emails come from yourcompany.com. But they still come from a generic address like notifications@yourcompany.com.

Connect Your Email is different:
- **Personal authorization** - each user connects their own email account
- **Individual sending** - emails come from john.smith@yourcompany.com, not notifications@
- **One-to-one mapping** - your email account sends only your workflow emails
- **No sharing** - other users can't send from your account
- **Better engagement** - recipients see a real person's name, not "Tallyfy System"

Custom SMTP is like a company mailroom handling all outgoing mail. Connect Your Email is like sending the letter yourself, with your signature.

### Why connect your personal email account?

**Deliverability improves when emails come from real accounts.** Your email address has years of reputation - people have you in their contacts, they've replied to you before, their email clients recognize you. That trust transfers to your workflow notifications.

Beyond getting past spam filters:

- **Higher response rates** - people respond to people, not systems
- **Context stays intact** - replies go to your actual inbox
- **Stronger audit trails** - every sent email appears in your Sent folder
- **Simpler compliance** - your company's existing email retention policies apply automatically

### How will the connection process work?

You'll click "Connect Email" in your Tallyfy settings, sign in with your email provider (Google or Microsoft), and grant permission to send on your behalf. No passwords are shared - it's handled through OAuth tokens you can revoke anytime.

**For Google Workspace/Gmail users:**
1. Click Connect in Tallyfy settings
2. Sign in to your Google account
3. Review the permissions (only email sending is requested)
4. Click Allow
5. Done - Tallyfy can now send as you

**For Microsoft 365/Outlook users:**
1. Click Connect in Tallyfy settings
2. Sign in with your Microsoft account
3. Your admin might need to approve the app first (one-time setup)
4. Grant the Mail.Send permission
5. Done - emails flow through your account

:::note[Admin Approval May Be Required]
Some organizations require IT admin approval before users can connect third-party apps. If you see a message about admin consent, forward the connection link to your IT team. They'll approve Tallyfy once for the whole organization, then everyone can connect.
:::

### What permissions will Tallyfy request?

**Only the minimum permission needed: sending email.** Tallyfy won't read your inbox, access your contacts, or modify your settings. One permission only - sending emails as you.

- **Google**: `gmail.send` scope only (not `gmail.readonly` or `gmail.modify`)
- **Microsoft**: `Mail.Send` permission only (not `Mail.Read` or `Mail.ReadWrite`)

Many email integrations request broad access to your entire mailbox. Tallyfy doesn't. You're granting permission to send specific workflow emails, nothing more.

### Will IT departments need to approve this?

It depends on your organization's security settings.

**Organizations with open policies** (most common):
- Users connect immediately
- No IT involvement needed

**Organizations with restricted policies**:
- IT admin gets a one-time approval request
- Admin approves Tallyfy for the entire organization
- Then all users can connect without further approval

Tallyfy will provide your IT team with OAuth application details, security documentation, exact scopes requested, and compliance certifications.

### How will this work with multiple email accounts?

Each Tallyfy user connects one primary email account. If you have multiple addresses, you choose which one to use for workflow notifications. You can switch anytime - disconnect the current one and connect a different one.

### What about email threading and conversations?

**Workflow emails will thread properly with existing conversations.** Tallyfy includes the proper headers to maintain email threads. Recipients can reply directly to you, and those replies appear in your regular inbox.

This creates natural conversation flows:
1. You assign a task to Sarah
2. Sarah gets an email from you (via Tallyfy)
3. Sarah replies with a question
4. You see her reply in your inbox
5. You respond normally
6. The whole conversation stays together

### When will this feature be available?

This feature is in development. Contact our support team to join the beta waitlist. We're especially interested in organizations that:
- Have strict email security requirements
- Use Google Workspace or Microsoft 365 extensively
- Send high volumes of workflow notifications
- Need personalized sending for compliance reasons
