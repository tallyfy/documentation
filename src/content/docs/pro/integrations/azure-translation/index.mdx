## Translation Options in Tallyfy

Tallyfy helps global teams work together by offering two ways to handle different languages:

1. **UI Language**: Change the language of Tallyfy's menus, buttons, and standard text.
2. **Content Translation**: Automatically translate the text people write (like task descriptions and comments) using Microsoft Azure AI.

### Changing the UI Language

This changes the language *you* see for Tallyfy's interface.

- **What it changes**: Menus, buttons, system messages, etc.
- **How to change it**:
  1. Click **Settings** (usually in the bottom left).
  2. Go to **My Account**.
  3. Find the **Personalization** section and choose your language from the dropdown.
  4. The Tallyfy interface will update instantly.

*If your needed language isn't listed, contact Tallyfy support.*

### Translating Content with Azure AI

This feature uses Microsoft Azure's translation service to automatically translate text that users have entered *within* Tallyfy.

- **What it translates**: Process descriptions, task instructions, form answers, comments, etc.
- **How it works**: Requires setup and an API key from Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services.
- **Who sets it up**: A Tallyfy Administrator needs to connect Tallyfy to your company's Azure account.

## Setting up the Azure Translation connection (Admin task)

### What you need

- A Microsoft Azure account with Cognitive Services available.
- An API key and endpoint details for the Azure Translation service.
- Administrator permission in Tallyfy.

### How administrators connect

*(Detailed steps are in the [Azure setup guide](/products/pro/integrations/azure-translation/how-to-set-up-azure-cognitive-ai-integration/), but the basic process is)*:

1. Get your API key and endpoint details from your Azure account.
2. In Tallyfy, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**.
3. Find the **Azure Translation Services** section.
4. Enter your Azure API key and necessary details.
5. Save the settings.

Once set up, a language selector menu will appear at the top of Tallyfy for all users.

## Using content translation for all users

Once the Azure connection is active:

1. Click the language selector icon (often a globe or country flag) in the top menu bar.
2. Choose the language you want to see content translated into.
3. As you navigate Tallyfy, the user-written text (like task descriptions) will be automatically translated into your chosen language.
4. This translation happens quickly as you view different pages or tasks.

## Tips for Better Translations

- **Write clearly**: Simple, clear sentences in the original language usually translate better.
- **Review important text**: For very critical information, it's always best to have a native speaker double-check the automatic translation.
- **Be aware of jargon**: Company-specific terms or technical jargon might not translate perfectly.
- **Be consistent**: Using the same terms consistently in the original text helps the AI translate them consistently.

## Troubleshooting Translation Issues

If content isn't translating:

1. Check if the Azure API key entered in Tallyfy settings is correct and active in your Azure account.
2. Make sure you have selected a language from the translation menu at the top of Tallyfy.
3. Verify that the Translation service is enabled within your Azure Cognitive Services resource.
4. Contact Tallyfy support if you still have problems.
