## Translation Options in Tallyfy

Working with a global team? You've got two ways to handle language barriers in Tallyfy:

1. **UI Language**: Switch the language of menus, buttons, and system messages
2. **Content Translation**: Let Microsoft Azure AI translate what people actually write - task descriptions, comments, everything

Here's the thing - if you're operating internationally, you need to know about [global workplace language requirements](/products/pro/integrations/azure-translation/global-workplace-language-requirements/). Many countries actually require translating employee documentation (think SOPs, policies, training materials) into local languages.

### Changing the UI Language

Want Tallyfy in your preferred language? This setting changes what *you* see in the interface.

- **What it changes**: Menus, buttons, system messages - the works
- **How to change it**:
  1. Click **Settings** (check the bottom left)
  2. Go to **My Account**
  3. Find the **Personalization** section and pick your language from the dropdown
  4. Boom - Tallyfy updates instantly

*Can't find your language? Contact Tallyfy support.*

### Translating Content with Azure AI

This is where it gets interesting. Microsoft Azure's translation service can automatically translate everything users type *within* Tallyfy.

- **What it translates**: Process descriptions, task instructions, form answers, comments - pretty much all user-generated content
- **How it works**: You'll need an API key from Microsoft Azure AI Services (yes, there's some setup involved)
- **Who sets it up**: Your Tallyfy Admin connects Tallyfy to your company's Azure account

## Setting up the Azure Translation connection (Admin task)

### What you need

- A Microsoft Azure account with Azure AI Services enabled
- Your API key and endpoint from the Azure Translation service
- Administrator permissions in Tallyfy

### How administrators connect

*(The [Azure setup guide](/products/pro/integrations/azure-translation/how-to-set-up-azure-cognitive-ai-integration/) has all the details, but here's what you're looking at)*:

1. Grab your API key and endpoint from Azure
2. Head to **Settings** > **Integrations** in Tallyfy
3. Look for **Azure Translation Services**
4. Plug in your Azure API key and details
5. Hit save

Done. You'll see a language selector appear at the top of Tallyfy for everyone.

## Using content translation for all users

Once Azure's hooked up, it's simple:

1. Click the language selector icon in the top menu bar (usually looks like a globe or flag)
2. Pick your language
3. Navigate around Tallyfy - all user-written text automatically appears in your chosen language
4. Translations happen in real-time as you click through tasks and processes

## Tips for Better Translations

- **Write clearly**: Short, simple sentences translate way better than complex ones
- **Review important text**: Got critical information? Have a native speaker double-check those automatic translations
- **Watch the jargon**: Your company's specific terms might come out weird in translation
- **Stay consistent**: Use the same terms throughout - it helps the AI keep translations consistent too

## Troubleshooting Translation Issues

Nothing happening? Here's what to check:

1. Is your Azure API key correct in Tallyfy settings? Double-check it's still active in Azure
2. Did you actually select a language from the translation menu at the top?
3. Make sure Translation service is turned on in your Azure AI Services resource
4. Still stuck? Time to contact Tallyfy support
