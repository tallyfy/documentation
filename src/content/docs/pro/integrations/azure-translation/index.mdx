## Translation options in Tallyfy

Working with a global team? You've got two ways to handle language barriers in Tallyfy:

1. **UI language** - switch the language of menus, buttons, and system messages
2. **Content translation** - let Microsoft Azure AI translate what people actually write - task descriptions, comments, form answers

If you're operating internationally, check out [global workplace language requirements](/products/pro/integrations/azure-translation/global-workplace-language-requirements/). Many countries require translating employee documentation (SOPs, policies, training materials) into local languages.

### Changing the UI language

This setting changes what *you* see in Tallyfy's interface.

- **What it changes**: Menus, buttons, and system messages
- **How to change it**:
  1. Click **Settings** (bottom left)
  2. Go to **My Account**
  3. Find the **Personalization** section and pick your language from the dropdown
  4. Tallyfy updates instantly

*Can't find your language? Contact Tallyfy support.*

### Translating content with Azure AI

Microsoft Azure's translation service can automatically translate everything users type *within* Tallyfy.

- **What it translates**: Process descriptions, task instructions, form answers, and comments - all user-generated content
- **How it works**: You'll need an API key from Microsoft Azure AI Services
- **Who sets it up**: Your Tallyfy administrator connects Tallyfy to your company's Azure account

## Setting up the Azure translation connection

### What you need

- A Microsoft Azure account with Azure AI Services enabled
- Your API key and endpoint from the Azure Translation service
- Administrator permissions in Tallyfy

### How administrators connect

The [Azure setup guide](/products/pro/integrations/azure-translation/how-to-set-up-azure-cognitive-ai-integration/) has full details. Here's the overview:

1. Get your API key and endpoint from Azure
2. Go to **Settings** > **Integrations** in Tallyfy
3. Find **Azure Translation Services**
4. Enter your Azure API key and endpoint
5. Save

Done. A language selector appears at the top of Tallyfy for everyone.

## Using content translation

Once Azure is connected:

1. Click the language selector icon in the top menu bar
2. Pick your language
3. Navigate around Tallyfy - all user-written text automatically appears in your chosen language
4. Translations happen in real-time as you move through tasks and processes

## Tips for better translations

- **Write clearly** - short, simple sentences translate far better than complex ones
- **Review important text** - have a native speaker double-check automatic translations for critical information
- **Watch the jargon** - company-specific terms might come out wrong in translation
- **Stay consistent** - using the same terms throughout helps the AI produce consistent translations

## Troubleshooting translation issues

Nothing happening? Here's what to check:

1. Verify your Azure API key is correct in Tallyfy settings and still active in Azure
2. Confirm you've selected a language from the translation menu at the top
3. Make sure Translation service is turned on in your Azure AI Services resource
4. Still stuck? Contact Tallyfy support
