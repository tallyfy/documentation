## Translation Capabilities in Tallyfy

Tallyfy offers two distinct translation capabilities to support global teams:

1. **UI Translation** - Interface language options that change the Tallyfy platform navigation and controls
2. **Content Translation** - Real-time translation of user-generated content using Azure Cognitive AI

### UI Translation

UI Translation changes the language of Tallyfy's interface elements, including:

- Navigation menus
- Button labels
- System messages
- Form field labels
- Standard text elements

To change the UI language:

1. Click on **Settings** in the sidebar
2. Go to **My Account**
3. Under **Personalization**, select your preferred language from the dropdown menu
4. The interface will immediately update to reflect your language selection

If you need a language not currently offered, contact Tallyfy support to request additional language options.

### Content Translation with Azure Cognitive AI

Content Translation uses Azure's AI translation services to dynamically translate user-generated content in real-time, including:

- Process descriptions
- Task instructions
- Form field content
- Comments and discussions
- Documents and attachments

This capability requires an Azure Cognitive Services API key and integration setup.

## Setting Up Azure Translation Integration

### Requirements

- An Azure account with access to Cognitive Services
- An Azure Cognitive Services API key with Translation services enabled
- Administrator access to your Tallyfy organization

### Integration Steps

1. Log in to your Azure portal and create or access a Cognitive Services resource
2. Obtain your Translation service API key and endpoint
3. In Tallyfy, navigate to **Settings > Integration**
4. Find the **Azure Translation Services** tile
5. Enter your Azure API key in the designated field
6. Save your configuration

Once activated, a language selection menu will appear in the top navigation bar of Tallyfy, allowing users to select their preferred language for content translation.

## Using Content Translation

After the Azure integration is configured:

1. Click the language selector in the top navigation menu
2. Choose your preferred language from the available options
3. All user-generated content will be automatically translated to your selected language
4. Translation occurs in real-time as you browse through different content

The translation happens within a few moments as you navigate through content in Tallyfy.

## Best Practices

- **Maintain clear source content**: Simple, clear writing translates more accurately
- **Review important translations**: For critical content, have a native speaker verify translations
- **Be aware of context**: Some technical terms or industry jargon may translate differently based on context
- **Use consistent terminology**: Consistent use of terms improves translation quality

## Troubleshooting

If content is not translating correctly:

1. Verify your Azure API key is active and has sufficient quota
2. Check that you've selected a language in the translation menu
3. Ensure your Azure Cognitive Services includes the Translation API feature
4. Contact Tallyfy support if issues persist
