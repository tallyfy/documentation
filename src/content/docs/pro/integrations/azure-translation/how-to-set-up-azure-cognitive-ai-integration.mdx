## Preparing for Azure Cognitive AI Integration

Tallyfy's content translation feature requires integration with Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services. This guide walks you through the complete setup process from creating an Azure account to configuring the integration in Tallyfy.

### Prerequisites

Before beginning the setup process, ensure you have:

- Administrator access to your Tallyfy organization
- Access to create or manage an Azure account
- Authorization to create Azure Cognitive Services resources
- Basic understanding of API keys and service endpoints

## Step 1: Azure Account Setup

If you don't already have an Azure account:

1. Visit the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
2. Click **Start free** or **Sign up**
3. Follow the prompts to create a Microsoft account or sign in with an existing one
4. Complete the registration process with payment information (required for account creation but translation services offer a free tier)

## Step 2: Create a Cognitive Services Resource

Once your Azure account is active:

1. Log in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
2. Click **Create a resource**
3. Search for "Translator" or "Cognitive Services"
4. Select **Translator** from the results
5. Click **Create**

## Step 3: Configure Your Translation Resource

Fill in the required information:

1. **Subscription**: Select your Azure subscription
2. **Resource Group**: Create a new group or select an existing one
3. **Region**: Choose a region geographically close to your users
4. **Name**: Enter a descriptive name for your resource
5. **Pricing Tier**: Select a tier (starts with a free tier with limited usage)
6. Click **Review + create**
7. After validation passes, click **Create**

Deployment typically takes a few minutes. Once complete, click **Go to resource**.

## Step 4: Retrieve API Key and Endpoint

To integrate with Tallyfy, you need your API key and endpoint:

1. In your Translator resource, navigate to **Keys and Endpoint** in the left menu
2. Copy **Key 1** or **Key 2** (either will work)
3. Copy the **Endpoint** URL
4. Store these securely - you'll need them for Tallyfy configuration

## Step 5: Configure Tallyfy Integration

With your Azure API key and endpoint ready:

1. Log in to Tallyfy as an administrator
2. Navigate to **Settings** in the left sidebar
3. Select **Integrations**
4. Find and click on the **Azure Translation Services** tile
5. Enter your API key in the designated field
6. Enter the endpoint URL
7. Click **Save** or **Activate**

## Step 6: Verify the Integration

To ensure the integration is working correctly:

1. Look for the language selector that should now appear in the top navigation bar
2. Select a language different from your default
3. Navigate to a process or task with textual content
4. Verify that the content is translated into your selected language
5. If content doesn't translate, check the troubleshooting section below

## Managing Azure Translation Costs

Azure Translator is priced based on the number of characters translated:

- The free tier includes 2 million characters per month
- Monitor your usage in the Azure portal under your Translator resource
- Set up spending limits and alerts to avoid unexpected charges
- Consider upgrading your tier if you regularly exceed free limits

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

If translation isn't working as expected:

### API Key Issues

- Verify you've copied the correct key from Azure
- Check if the key needs to be renewed (keys expire or can be regenerated)
- Ensure you have sufficient quota remaining in your Azure subscription

### Connection Problems

- Confirm your Tallyfy environment can reach Azure services
- Check if any network security policies might block the connection
- Verify that the correct endpoint URL is configured

### Translation Limitations

- Some specialized terminology might not translate accurately
- Very long text might be truncated or processed in parts
- Some languages have better translation quality than others

If problems persist, contact Tallyfy support with details about your Azure setup.
