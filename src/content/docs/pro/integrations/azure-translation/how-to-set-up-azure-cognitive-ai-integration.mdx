## Connecting Azure Translator to Tallyfy

Tallyfy uses Microsoft Azure Translator to translate user-generated content - task descriptions, comments, form data - into your preferred language in real time. Setup takes about 15 minutes and requires three pieces of information from Azure: an API key, your resource name, and the region.

### What you'll need

- Administrator access to your Tallyfy organization
- An Azure account (or permission to create one)
- Permission to create Azure Translator resources

### Step 1: Azure account setup

If you don't already have an Azure account:

<Steps>
1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
2. Click **Start free** or **Sign up**
3. Create a Microsoft account or sign in with an existing one
4. Complete registration with payment information (required for account creation, but translation services have a generous free tier)
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create a Translator resource

<Steps>
1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
2. Click **Create a resource**
3. Search for "Translator"
4. Select **Translator** from the results
5. Click **Create**
</Steps>

### Step 3: Configure your Translator resource

<Steps>
1. **Subscription** - choose your Azure subscription
2. **Resource Group** - create a new group or select an existing one
3. **Region** - pick a region close to your users (note this down - you'll need it for Tallyfy)
4. **Name** - enter a descriptive name for your resource (note this down too - this is your resource name)
5. **Pricing Tier** - the free tier includes 2 million characters per month
6. Click **Review + create**, then click **Create** after validation passes
</Steps>

Deployment takes 1-3 minutes. Click **Go to resource** when it's done.

### Step 4: Copy your API key

<Steps>
1. In your Translator resource, go to **Keys and Endpoint** in the left menu
2. Copy **Key 1** or **Key 2** (either works)
</Steps>

You now have the three values Tallyfy needs: the **API key**, the **resource name** (what you named your Translator resource), and the **region** you selected during creation.

### Step 5: Configure Tallyfy

<Steps>
1. Sign in to Tallyfy as an administrator
2. Go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
3. Find the Azure Translation configuration
4. Enter your **API key**, **resource name**, and **region**
5. Click **Save**
</Steps>

Tallyfy automatically tests your credentials before saving. If the test fails, you'll see an error message - double-check each field.

### Step 6: Verify translation works

<Steps>
1. Look for the language picker in the top navigation bar (it appears once Azure is connected)
2. Select a different language
3. Open any process or task with text content
4. Content should translate within seconds
</Steps>

### Managing costs

Azure charges by the character. The free tier covers 2 million characters monthly - roughly 400,000 words. Monitor usage in the Azure portal under your Translator resource, and set up spending alerts if you want to avoid surprises.

### Troubleshooting

Translation not working? Here's what to check:

- **Credentials** - verify you entered the correct API key, resource name, and region (all three are required)
- **Key status** - Azure keys can be regenerated, which invalidates the old one
- **Quota** - check your Azure subscription hasn't exceeded its character limit
- **Network** - confirm your environment can reach Azure services (firewalls or security policies may block the connection)
- **Language pairs** - translation quality varies by language combination, and specialized industry terms may not translate perfectly
