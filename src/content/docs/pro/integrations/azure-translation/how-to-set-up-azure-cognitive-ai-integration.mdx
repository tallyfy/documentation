## Preparing for Azure Cognitive AI integration

You need Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services to enable Tallyfy's content translation feature. This takes about 15 minutes to set up. We'll walk through everything - from creating an Azure account to getting translation working in Tallyfy.

### Requirements

Here's what you'll need:

- Administrator access to your Tallyfy organization
- Access to create or manage an Azure account
- Permission to create Azure Cognitive Services resources
- Basic understanding of API keys and service endpoints

### Step 1: Azure account setup

If you don't already have an Azure account:

<Steps>
1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
2. Click **Start free** or **Sign up**
3. Follow the prompts to create a Microsoft account or sign in with an existing one
4. Complete the registration with payment information (yes, it's required for account creation - but don't worry, translation services have a generous free tier)
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create a Cognitive Services resource

With your Azure account ready, let's create the translation service:

<Steps>
1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
2. Click **Create a resource**
3. Search for "Translator" or "Cognitive Services"
4. Select **Translator** from the results
5. Click **Create**
</Steps>

### Step 3: Configure your translation resource

Azure needs some details about your resource:

<Steps>
1. **Subscription**: Choose your Azure subscription
2. **Resource Group**: Create a new group or select an existing one
3. **Region**: Choose a region close to your users (this affects translation speed)
4. **Name**: Enter a descriptive name for your resource
5. **Pricing Tier**: Start with the free tier - it includes 2 million characters monthly
6. Click **Review + create**
7. After validation passes, click **Create**
</Steps>

Deployment takes 1-3 minutes. When it's done, click **Go to resource**.

### Step 4: Retrieve API key and endpoint

Here's where you grab the credentials Tallyfy needs:

<Steps>
1. In your Translator resource, go to **Keys and Endpoint** in the left menu
2. Copy **Key 1** or **Key 2** (either will work)
3. Copy the **Endpoint** URL
4. Keep these handy - you'll paste them into Tallyfy next
</Steps>

### Step 5: Configure Tallyfy integration

Time to connect everything. With your Azure API key and endpoint copied:

<Steps>
1. Sign in to Tallyfy as an administrator
2. Navigate to **Settings** in the left sidebar
3. Select **Integrations**
4. Find and click the **Azure Translation Services** tile
5. Paste your API key in the appropriate field
6. Paste the endpoint URL
7. Click **Save** or **Activate**
</Steps>

### Step 6: Verify the integration

Let's make sure everything's working:

<Steps>
1. Look for the language picker in the top navigation bar (it appears automatically)
2. Select a different language from your default
3. Navigate to any process or task with text content
4. The content should translate into your selected language within seconds
5. If translation doesn't work, check the troubleshooting section below
</Steps>

### Managing Azure Translation costs

Want to keep costs under control? Azure charges by the character:

- The free tier gives you 2 million characters monthly - that's roughly 400,000 words
- Monitor usage in the Azure portal under your Translator resource
- Set up spending alerts to avoid surprises
- If you're hitting limits regularly, consider upgrading your tier

### Troubleshooting common issues

Translation not working? Here's what to check:

#### API key issues

- Double-check you copied the complete key from Azure
- Keys can expire or get regenerated - verify yours is still active
- Check your Azure subscription quota hasn't been exceeded

#### Connection problems

- Verify your Tallyfy environment can reach Azure services
- Network security policies might be blocking the connection
- Confirm the endpoint URL is correct and complete

#### Translation limitations

- Industry-specific terms might not translate perfectly
- Extra-long text blocks may be processed in chunks
- Translation quality varies by language pair - English to Spanish works better than English to Finnish, for example
