## Preparing for Azure Cognitive AI Integration

Tallyfy's content translation feature needs integration with Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services. This guide takes you through the complete setup process from creating an Azure account to setting up the integration in Tallyfy.

### Requirements

Before starting the setup process, make sure you have:

- Administrator access to your Tallyfy organization
- Access to create or manage an Azure account
- Permission to create Azure Cognitive Services resources
- Basic understanding of API keys and service endpoints

### Step 1: Azure account setup

If you don't already have an Azure account:

<Steps>
1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
2. Click **Start free** or **Sign up**
3. Follow the prompts to create a Microsoft account or sign in with an existing one
4. Finish the registration process with payment information (needed for account creation but translation services offer a free tier)
</Steps>

### Step 2: Create a Cognitive Services resource

Once your Azure account is set up:

<Steps>
1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
2. Click **Create a resource**
3. Search for "Translator" or "Cognitive Services"
4. Pick **Translator** from the results
5. Click **Create**
</Steps>

### Step 3: Configure your translation resource

Fill in the needed information:

<Steps>
1. **Subscription**: Pick your Azure subscription
2. **Resource Group**: Create a new group or pick an existing one
3. **Region**: Pick a region geographically close to your users
4. **Name**: Type a descriptive name for your resource
5. **Pricing Tier**: Pick a tier (starts with a free tier with limited usage)
6. Click **Review + create**
7. After validation passes, click **Create**
</Steps>

Deployment usually takes a few minutes. Once done, click **Go to resource**.

### Step 4: Retrieve API key and endpoint

To work with Tallyfy, you need your API key and endpoint:

<Steps>
1. In your Translator resource, go to **Keys and Endpoint** in the left menu
2. Copy **Key 1** or **Key 2** (either will work)
3. Copy the **Endpoint** URL
4. Store these safely - you'll need them for Tallyfy setup
</Steps>

With your Azure API key and endpoint ready:

1. Sign in to Tallyfy as an administrator
2. Go to **Settings** in the left sidebar
3. Pick **Integrations**
4. Find and click on the **Azure Translation Services** tile
5. Type your API key in the right field
6. Type the endpoint URL
7. Click **Save** or **Activate**
</Steps>

### Step 6: Verify the integration

To make sure the integration is working properly:

<Steps>
1. Look for the language picker that should now show up in the top navigation bar
2. Pick a language different from your default
3. Go to a process or task with text content
4. Check that the content gets translated into your chosen language
5. If content doesn't translate, look at the troubleshooting section below
</Steps>

### Managing Azure Translation costs

Azure Translator gets priced based on the number of characters translated:

- The free tier includes 2 million characters per month
- Track your usage in the Azure portal under your Translator resource
- Set up spending limits and alerts to avoid surprise charges
- Think about upgrading your tier if you regularly go over free limits

### Troubleshooting common issues

If translation isn't working as you'd expect:

#### API key issues

- Check that you've copied the right key from Azure
- See if the key needs renewal (keys expire or can get regenerated)
- Make sure you have enough quota left in your Azure subscription

#### Connection problems

- Check that your Tallyfy environment can reach Azure services
- See if any network security policies might block the connection
- Make sure the right endpoint URL is set up

#### Translation limitations

- Some specialized terms might not translate well
- Very long text might get cut off or processed in parts
- Some languages have better translation quality than others

If problems continue, contact Tallyfy support with details about your Azure setup.
