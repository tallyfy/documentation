## Use content translation in Tallyfy

*(Note: This feature requires Administrator setup of the [Azure Cognitive AI integration](/products/pro/integrations/azure-translation/how-to-set-up-azure-cognitive-ai-integration/) first.)*

Tallyfy's content translation automatically translates user-generated text in real-time using Microsoft Azure AI. Each team member reads content in their preferred language - across 100+ supported languages.

This works separately from the [UI language setting](/products/pro/integrations/azure-translation/), which controls buttons and menus. Content translation handles the text your team actually writes - descriptions, comments, and form field answers.

### What gets translated

Content translation covers visible text that you and your team create:

- Descriptions and instructions in templates and tasks.
- Information entered into form fields.
- Comments added to tasks or processes.

### What stays in the original language

- Tallyfy's interface elements - use the separate [UI language setting](/products/pro/integrations/azure-translation/) for those.
- Standard system messages.
- Form field labels (but the answers *in* those fields do get translated).

## How to set up your content language

Once your organization has the Azure AI connection configured, you'll see a globe icon in Tallyfy's top menu bar. The globe animates when translation is actively processing.

<Steps>
1. Click the globe icon in the top menu bar.

2. In the **Content Language** section, click **Edit** and choose your preferred language from the dropdown.
3. Save your selection. Tallyfy translates visible text on screen as you browse.
</Steps>

### Where translations appear

- **In templates**: Descriptions and instructions display in your chosen language.
- **In tasks**: Instructions, comments, and form field answers show up translated. Text you enter is saved in your language but appears translated to others based on *their* preference.
- **In reports**: Text descriptions get translated. Numbers, charts, and fixed labels stay unchanged.

### Tips for better translations

- Write original text clearly and keep sentences short.
- Avoid slang, jargon, or culturally specific phrases.
- Have a native speaker review important translated content when possible.

### Switching languages

<Steps>
1. Click the globe icon in the top menu bar.
2. Choose a different language and save.
3. Content refreshes with translations in the new language. Tallyfy remembers your choice.
</Steps>

To turn off translation, select **No Translation** from the content language dropdown.

### How it works for multilingual teams

- Each person picks their preferred reading language independently.
- Everyone sees the same information - just translated for them.
- Comments or form answers typed in one language appear translated automatically for users with a different language preference.
- Numbers and dates stay consistent across all languages.
