## Understanding Content Translation

*(Note: This feature requires an Administrator to set up the [Azure Cognitive AI integration](/products/pro/integrations/azure-translation/how-to-set-up-azure-cognitive-ai-integration/) first.)*

Once enabled, Tallyfy's content translation feature automatically translates text written by users in real-time. This helps teams who speak different languages work together smoothly. It uses Microsoft Azure AI and is separate from the setting that changes Tallyfy's menus and buttons (UI Language).

### What gets translated?

Content translation applies to text that people type into Tallyfy, such as:

- Descriptions and instructions in processes and tasks.
- Information entered into form fields.
- Comments added to tasks or processes.
- Text within attached documents (if the format is supported).
- Emails sent by Tallyfy related to processes.

### What stays in the original language?

Some things are *not* translated by this feature:

- Tallyfy's interface (buttons, menus â€“ use the separate [UI Language setting](/products/pro/integrations/azure-translation/) for this).
- Standard system messages.
- The names you give to custom form fields (but the answers *in* the fields get translated).

## How to Use Content Translation

If your organization has set up the Azure AI connection, you'll see a language selector icon (like a globe) in the top menu bar of Tallyfy.

<Steps>
1. Click the language selector icon.

2. Choose the language you want to read the content in from the dropdown list.
3. Tallyfy will immediately start showing user-written text translated into your selected language as you browse.
</Steps>

### Where you'll see translations

- **In Templates**: Descriptions and instructions will appear translated.
- **In Tasks**: Instructions, comments, and form field answers will appear translated. (When you type an answer or comment, it's saved in your language but shown translated to others based on *their* language choice).
- **In Reports**: Text descriptions will be translated (but numbers, charts, and fixed labels stay the same).

### Tips for Getting Good Translations

Automatic translation works best when:

- The original text is written clearly and simply.
- Slang, complex jargon, or culturally specific phrases are avoided.
- Sentences are kept reasonably short.
- Important translated text is double-checked by a native speaker if possible.

### Switching Your Translation Language

You can change the language you see translations in at any time:

<Steps>
1. Click the language selector icon in the top menu bar.
2. Choose a different language.
3. The content will refresh and show translations in the new language.
4. Tallyfy remembers your choice for next time.
</Steps>

### Working in Multilingual Teams

Content translation makes it easier to work with colleagues who speak different languages:

- Each person can choose their own preferred language to read content.
- Everyone sees the same information, just translated for them.
- Comments or form answers typed in one language will be translated for users viewing in another language.
- Numbers and dates always stay the same.
