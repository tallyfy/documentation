## Use the content translation feature

*(Note: This feature requires Administrator setup of the [Azure Cognitive AI integration](/products/pro/integrations/azure-translation/how-to-set-up-azure-cognitive-ai-integration/) first.)*

With Tallyfy's content translation, your multilingual team can actually understand each other. The feature automatically translates user-generated text in real-time - so everyone reads content in their preferred language.

Here's the thing: Microsoft Azure AI powers this translation, and it works completely separately from UI language settings. It focuses on the content you create, not the buttons and menus. Your workflows run naturally across language barriers.

### What content does Tallyfy translation cover?

Content translation covers all the text you and your team create:

- Descriptions and instructions in processes and tasks.
- Information entered into form fields.
- Comments added to tasks or processes.
- Text within attached documents (if the format is supported).
- Emails sent by Tallyfy related to processes.

### What stays in the original language?

Some things aren't translated:

- Tallyfy's interface (buttons, menus – use the separate [UI Language setting](/products/pro/integrations/azure-translation/) for this).
- Standard system messages.
- The names you give to custom form fields (but the answers *in* the fields get translated).

## How to Use Content Translation

Once your organization sets up the Azure AI connection, you'll spot a language selector icon (looks like a globe) in Tallyfy's top menu bar.

<Steps>
1. Click the language selector icon.

2. Choose the language you want to read the content in from the dropdown list.
3. Tallyfy will immediately start showing user-written text translated into your selected language as you browse.
</Steps>

### Where you'll see translations

- **In Templates**: Descriptions and instructions appear in your chosen language.
- **In Tasks**: Instructions, comments, and form field answers show up translated. When you type an answer or comment, it's saved in your language but appears translated to others based on *their* language preference.
- **In Reports**: Text descriptions get translated (numbers, charts, and fixed labels remain unchanged).

### Tips for Getting Good Translations

Want better automatic translations? Follow these guidelines:

- Write original text clearly. Simple works best.
- Skip the slang, jargon, or culturally specific phrases.
- Keep sentences reasonably short.
- Have a native speaker double-check important translated text when possible.

### Switching Your Translation Language

Need to change languages? Easy:

<Steps>
1. Click the language selector icon in the top menu bar.
2. Choose a different language.
3. The content will refresh and show translations in the new language.
4. Tallyfy remembers your choice for next time.
</Steps>

### Working in Multilingual Teams

Content translation transforms how international teams collaborate:

- Each person picks their preferred reading language.
- Everyone sees the same information - just translated for them.
- Type comments or form answers in one language, and users viewing in another language see them translated automatically.
- Numbers and dates stay consistent across all languages.
