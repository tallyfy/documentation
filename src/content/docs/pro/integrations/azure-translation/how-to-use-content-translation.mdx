## Understanding Content Translation

Tallyfy's content translation feature automatically translates user-generated content in real-time, making it easier for global teams to collaborate across language barriers. This feature is powered by Azure Cognitive AI and works separately from the UI language settings.

### What Gets Translated

Content translation applies to user-generated content including:

- Process descriptions and instructions
- Task details and requirements
- Form fields and responses
- Comments and discussions
- Attached document content (when supported)
- Emails and notifications related to processes

### What Remains in Original Language

Some elements remain in their original language:

- UI elements (buttons, menus, system labels)
- Fixed system messages
- Custom field names (though the content within fields is translated)

## Accessing Content Translation

Once your organization has set up Azure Cognitive AI integration, you can access translation features as follows:

<Steps>
1. Look for the language selector in the top navigation bar
2. Click on the language icon or current language name
3. Select your desired target language from the dropdown menu
4. All content will immediately begin translating to your selected language
</Steps>

## Using Translation in Different Areas

### In Process Templates

When viewing or editing process templates:

<Steps>
1. Navigate to any template
2. The description, instructions, and other content will automatically appear in your selected language
3. Changes you make will be saved in the original language but displayed to you in your preferred language
</Steps>

### During Task Execution

When working on tasks:

<Steps>
1. Open any active task
2. Instructions, comments, and form fields will display in your selected language
3. Your responses are saved in your input language but will appear translated to others using different language settings
4. Click **Complete** when finished
</Steps>

### In Reports and Analytics

When viewing reports:

<Steps>
1. Navigate to any report or dashboard
2. Text content and descriptions will be translated
3. Fixed field names and metrics remain in the original language for consistency
</Steps>

## Translation Quality Considerations

To get the best results from content translation:

- **Use clear language** in source content to improve translation accuracy
- **Avoid slang, idioms, and jargon** that may not translate well
- **Keep sentences concise** as shorter text typically translates more accurately
- **Provide context** when possible to help the AI understand industry-specific terms
- **Review critical content** in multiple languages if possible

## Switching Between Languages

You can change your translation language at any time:

<Steps>
1. Click the language selector in the top navigation
2. Choose a different language
3. All content will refresh to display in the newly selected language
4. Your language preference is saved to your user profile
</Steps>

## Collaboration with Multilingual Teams

When collaborating across languages:

- Each team member can select their preferred language
- Everyone sees the same content in their chosen language
- Input from any language is translated for all other users
- Timestamps and numerical data remain consistent across languages

This creates a seamless experience where each team member can work in their preferred language while maintaining full collaboration capabilities.
