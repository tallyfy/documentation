title: Translation requirements for process documentation
---

## Where do laws exist to translate process content to local languages?

**Important** - this article is not legal advice. You need to do your own research and use this content at your own risk.

Some countries fine you for English-only workplace documents. Others just recommend translations. This reference maps out which jurisdictions require workplace content in local languages - and which ones are fine with English only.

Organizations using Tallyfy must ensure their templates and SOPs meet local language laws. Miss this, and you could face fines or unenforceable contracts.

### What types of workplace content are subject to language requirements?

These are the main categories that different countries regulate:

- **Employment contracts and agreements**
- **SOPs and work instructions**
- **Safety procedures and training materials**
- **Employee handbooks and policies**
- **Disciplinary procedures and codes of conduct**
- **Form fields and data collection instruments**
- **Process templates and workflow documentation**
- **Training content and instructional materials**

## North America

### Canada (federal)
**Requirement level:** Mandatory (public sector); no specific law (private sector)
**Applies to:** Public sector (federal government); private sector has no specific requirements
**Requirements:** The Official Languages Act mandates bilingual English and French communication in federal institutions. Federal employees in designated bilingual regions can work and receive documents in their official language of choice. Private-sector workplaces outside Quebec have no translation requirements. [2]

### Canada - Quebec
**Requirement level:** Mandatory
**Applies to:** All employers (private and public) in Quebec
**Requirements:** The Charter of the French Language (Bill 96) mandates French as the language of work. All written communications to employees - offers, contracts, policies, and training materials - must be in French unless an employee specifically requests another language. Pre-existing English documents had to be translated by June 1, 2023. This applies even if only one employee is in Quebec. Non-compliance can result in fines. [1]

### Canada - other provinces
**Requirement level:** No specific law (use official language)
**Applies to:** Private sector (English or French by practice); public sector (bilingual in New Brunswick)
**Requirements:** No province outside Quebec requires employee documents in a language other than English. Documents are typically in English or French in francophone areas. New Brunswick mandates bilingual public services but has no translation requirement for private employers' internal documents. [2]

### United States (federal)
**Requirement level:** Mandatory for safety/rights comprehension; no blanket requirement otherwise
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors (for OSHA and federal notices)
**Requirements:** No general law requires workplace document translation, but employers must convey certain information in a language employees understand. OSHA requires safety training and hazard communications in comprehensible language. Federal notices (EEOC, FMLA posters) are available in Spanish and other languages - employers are encouraged or required to use them if a significant workforce portion isn't English-fluent. English-only workplace policies cannot be enforced if they impede employee rights (per EEOC rules). [3]

### United States - states
**Requirement level:** Mandatory for specific notices (varies by state); recommended for other documents
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors (state-level requirements)
**Requirements:** California's Labor Code SS2810.5 requires new-hire wage/hour notices in "the language the employer normally uses to communicate employment-related information." California and New York mandate certain posters or notices in Spanish and other languages if threshold percentages of workers aren't English-proficient. Employers are strongly advised to provide translations (especially Spanish) for handbooks, safety training, and key policies when large portions of employees are non-English speakers. [4]

### Mexico
**Requirement level:** Mandatory (contracts and official documents in Spanish); recommended (policies/SOPs)
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors
**Requirements:** Spanish is the official language for employment relations. Employment contracts must be in Spanish to be legally valid, with Spanish prevailing in legal effect. Documents submitted to labor authorities or courts must be in Spanish or accompanied by official translation. Many companies provide bilingual Spanish-English contracts, but Spanish text is binding. No statutory requirement exists for day-to-day communication translation, but Spanish versions of policies and safety instructions are strongly recommended. [5]

### Other North America
**Requirement level:** No specific translation laws (default to official language)
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors
**Requirements:** Central America and Caribbean countries (Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Dominican Republic, etc.) use their official language - Spanish in most cases, French in Haiti, English in some Caribbean states - for employment contracts and internal documents. No specific laws mandate translation beyond the official/national language. Panama and Costa Rica generally require Spanish for labor matters; English documents should be translated if reviewed by authorities. [12]

## Europe

### France
**Requirement level:** Mandatory (French required for all employee documents)
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors (labor code covers employment relationships)
**Requirements:** The Toubon Law and Labor Code Article L.1321-6 require all documents setting out employee obligations or instructions to be in French. This covers employment contracts, policies, codes of conduct, collective agreements, and even software interfaces or manuals used by employees. No clause in a foreign language can be enforced against an employee. Courts are strict - employers have been fined for issuing English-only handbooks. Translations may be attached, but French is authoritative. [6]

### Belgium - Flanders (Dutch-speaking)
**Requirement level:** Mandatory (Dutch only)
**Applies to:** All employers (private and public) in the region
**Requirements:** Regional language laws require all employment documents and communications in the Flemish region be in Dutch. Documents in another language are null and void against the employer. Employees can still invoke an English clause in their favor, but employers cannot enforce it. Official work rules and contracts must be in Dutch; unofficial English translations can be provided for convenience. [7]

### Belgium - Wallonia (French-speaking)
**Requirement level:** Mandatory (French only)
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors
**Requirements:** All employment documents in the Walloon region must be in French. Using another language with employees is prohibited, and documents not in French are legally null and void. An English version can be given for reference but has no legal force. [7]

### Belgium - Brussels (bilingual)
**Requirement level:** Mandatory (French or Dutch depending on employee)
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors
**Requirements:** Employment language follows the employee's language (assumed French or Dutch). Employers in Brussels often provide documents in both languages. Unlike Flanders/Wallonia, the sanction for using the wrong language isn't nullity - instead, employees can demand translation at employer's expense. [7]

### Luxembourg
**Requirement level:** No mandatory language law (mutual understanding required)
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors
**Requirements:** No statutory requirement regarding employment document language. Contracts and policies are usually in official languages (French, German, or Luxembourgish) or English - as long as both parties understand the language used. English-only contracts are common for international staff, but translations may be provided for clarity. [8]

### Germany
**Requirement level:** No explicit requirement (best practice to use German)
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors (German is de facto for public sector)
**Requirements:** German law doesn't mandate employment documents be in German. English contracts are lawful if both parties understand them. However, courts hold that employees must comprehend workplace rules - key instructions (safety, disciplinary rules) should be explained in German if workers aren't fluent. Translation is recommended as best practice but not legally required in the private sector. Public sector generally requires German for official documents. [11]

### Netherlands
**Requirement level:** No specific law (ensure employee understanding)
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors
**Requirements:** Dutch law doesn't require employment contracts or policies in Dutch. Employers may draft documents in English or another language if employees are comfortable with it. However, if workers don't understand a document's language, employers must provide explanation or translation. In legal disputes, courts consider whether employees could comprehend terms. Providing Dutch translations is recommended to avoid ambiguity. [8]

### Spain
**Requirement level:** Mandatory (Spanish for contracts; bilingual as needed)
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors
**Requirements:** Spanish labor law requires employment contracts be in Spanish (Castilian). Bilingual contracts (Spanish-English) are allowed, but Spanish text governs in case of conflict. Handbooks and safety instructions should also be in Spanish for full effectiveness. In autonomous regions (Catalonia, Basque Country), local co-official languages may be used in addition to Spanish, but Spanish is generally sufficient legally. [10]

### Italy
**Requirement level:** No specific requirement (Italian is standard; translation strongly advised)
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors (public sector uses Italian)
**Requirements:** Italian law doesn't explicitly require Italian-language employment contracts for private companies. Contracts may be in a foreign language if both parties understand it. However, all legal proceedings are in Italian, so providing Italian translations when employing local staff is strongly recommended. Courts may favor Italian text interpretation or require certified translation of foreign-language documents. [8]

### Poland
**Requirement level:** Mandatory (Polish required; bilingual allowed)
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors
**Requirements:** The Polish Language Act (amended 2011) requires employment documents be in Polish to be binding. Employment contracts, agreements, and internal work regulations must be in Polish (bilingual versions are allowed). Polish text prevails in case of discrepancies. Employees may request documents in another language in addition to Polish, but Polish remains the legal reference. [9]

### Czech Republic
**Requirement level:** No specific law (Czech used customarily)
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors
**Requirements:** No law requires Czech for employment documents. The Labor Code allows agreements in other languages if both parties agree and understand them. In practice, most contracts with local staff are in Czech. Providing documents in Czech is highly recommended since court or authority proceedings require Czech versions. [8]

### Hungary
**Requirement level:** No specific law (use Hungarian for clarity)
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors
**Requirements:** Hungarian law doesn't mandate Hungarian in employment contracts or policies. Employers and employees can choose another language if mutually understood. However, authorities and courts require Hungarian translations in official processes. Using Hungarian or bilingual documents is the norm. [8]

### Romania
**Requirement level:** Mandatory for contracts (Romanian); others recommended
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors
**Requirements:** Under the Labor Code, employment contracts must be in Romanian (even if foreign language versions are also provided). Accompanying documents (internal rules, job descriptions) aren't legally required to be in Romanian as long as employees understand them. In practice, most HR documents are in Romanian. For foreign staff, companies often use bilingual formats. [8]

### Slovenia
**Requirement level:** Mandatory (Slovenian required)
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors
**Requirements:** All employment documents (contracts, policies, internal instructions) must be in Slovenian by law. They may be bilingual, but Slovene must be one of the languages. Internal communications related to employees' rights and safety must also be in Slovene. This is strictly enforced - documents not in Slovenian could be deemed non-compliant. [8]

### Austria
**Requirement level:** No specific law (German by practice)
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors
**Requirements:** Austrian law doesn't require German for employment documents, but it's implicitly expected. Virtually all employment contracts and workplace policies are in German. English contracts aren't invalid if employees fully understand them, but filings with authorities must be in German. Public sector employment is conducted in German by law. [8]

### Other Europe
**Requirement level:** Varies; mostly no mandatory rule (default to official language or mutual understanding)
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors
**Requirements:** **Switzerland:** No nationwide rule for private sector; companies use local official language (German, French, or Italian depending on canton) or English if employees agree. **Nordic countries (Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland):** No legal mandates to use local language in contracts, but documents are generally in the local language for native employees. Finland explicitly states employees must be briefed in a comprehensible language. **United Kingdom/Ireland:** No requirement to translate policies (English is working language). Providing translations for immigrant workers is considered good practice for health and safety reasons. **Eastern Europe (Baltics, Balkans not listed above):** Official language is required for official filings and strongly recommended for contracts, but not always explicitly mandated by statute. [12]

## Asia-Pacific

### China
**Requirement level:** De facto mandatory (Chinese needed for legal enforceability)
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors (official dealings in Chinese)
**Requirements:** Chinese labor laws don't explicitly state "contracts must be in Chinese," but in practice Chinese (Mandarin) is required for legal and administrative purposes. Employment contracts should be executed in Chinese for legal certainty - Chinese language contracts are required if disputes go to courts or documents are submitted to government agencies. Companies often sign bilingual Chinese-English contracts, but the Chinese version prevails legally. Internal regulations and manuals should be in Chinese or translated. [13]

### Japan
**Requirement level:** No explicit requirement (Japanese strongly recommended)
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors (public sector uses Japanese by law)
**Requirements:** No specific law forces Japanese use in private employment contracts or policies. However, labor disputes are handled in Japanese, so it's standard practice to provide employment terms in Japanese. Government guidance encourages that non-Japanese workers be given contracts in a language they understand. Foreign companies operating in Japan often prepare bilingual documents (Japanese and English). [8]

### South Korea
**Requirement level:** No specific law (Korean expected in practice)
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors
**Requirements:** No law explicitly requires Korean-language contracts in the private sector, but Korean is the normal working language. If employers provide English contracts to local employees, courts will examine whether employees truly understood them - Korean translations may be demanded in disputes. For compliance (submitting rules to authorities or for litigation), Korean versions are required. [12]

### India
**Requirement level:** No nationwide requirement (state laws on notices in local languages)
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors (state-specific)
**Requirements:** India has no single official language nationally (the constitution recognizes Hindi and English). English is commonly used for contracts and policies in private companies. However, many states require certain notices (standing orders, factory safety instructions) be displayed in the local regional language (Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, etc.). Employers must ensure all employees comprehend workplace rules - which often means providing translations in local language for blue-collar workers. Government forms use Hindi or the relevant state language (with English translations). [12]

### Australia
**Requirement level:** No requirement (English is standard)
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors
**Requirements:** Australia has no laws requiring translation of employment documents. English is the de facto language of business. For safety training, employers must ensure communication is effective, which may involve translation or interpreters if language barriers exist. Some large employers translate key policies into languages like Chinese or Arabic as best practice, but providing documents in English is sufficient under Australian law. [12]

### New Zealand
**Requirement level:** No requirement
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors
**Requirements:** No requirement to translate employment documents. English (and Maori in some public contexts) is used for contracts and workplace policies. If workers have limited English, employers should take reasonable steps to communicate in a way that person understands (which could include translation). But there's no specific statute compelling written translations. [12]

### Indonesia
**Requirement level:** Mandatory (Indonesian required; bilingual allowed)
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors
**Requirements:** Indonesian language law (Law No. 24/2009) requires any agreement involving an Indonesian party be in Bahasa Indonesia. Employment contracts with Indonesian employees must have an Indonesian version. If a foreign party is involved, the contract may be bilingual (Indonesian and English), but Indonesian text is authoritative. Indonesia's Supreme Court has said absence of an Indonesian version won't automatically void a contract if no bad faith is involved - but employers should comply and issue Indonesian-language contracts. Company regulations must also be in Indonesian. [14]

### Malaysia
**Requirement level:** No specific requirement (Malay official in public sector; flexible in private)
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors
**Requirements:** Malaysia's laws don't mandate a particular language for private employment contracts - English is widely used and legally acceptable, as is Malay (Bahasa Malaysia). In public sector and official dealings, Malay is the official language. Many firms use dual-language (Malay/English) contracts. Safety-related communications should be explained in Malay if workers aren't fluent in English. No penalty is specified for using English only, but understanding is key under Occupational Safety guidelines. [12]

### Singapore
**Requirement level:** No requirement (English is default business language)
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors
**Requirements:** Singapore has four official languages (English, Mandarin Chinese, Malay, Tamil), with English as the main working language. No legal requirement to translate employment materials - English contracts and handbooks are the norm. The government publishes some mandatory notices in multiple languages, and employers are encouraged to communicate in a language workers understand (especially in construction/domestic work sectors). Legally, an English document suffices. [12]

### Other Asia-Pacific
**Requirement level:** Varies (Vietnam/Thailand - mandatory local language; others - recommended)
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors
**Requirements:** **Philippines:** English is an official language and almost all employment documents are in English; no translation law required. **Vietnam:** Labor code requires contracts with Vietnamese employees be in Vietnamese (or bilingual with Vietnamese) to be enforceable; internal labor regulations must also be in Vietnamese. **Thailand:** Thai labor law expects employment agreements to be in Thai if with Thai staff; Thai versions are needed for official filings or disputes. For most other Asian countries not listed, the general pattern is that official national language should be used for employment communications, but specific translation mandates are uncommon. [12]

## Middle East & Africa

### United Arab Emirates
**Requirement level:** Mandatory (Arabic, with English translation optionally)
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors (government forms in Arabic)
**Requirements:** UAE labor law requires employment contracts to be in Arabic. In practice, contracts are typically bilingual Arabic-English, but Arabic text is the legally binding version. All filings with the Ministry of Human Resources must be in Arabic. Workplace policies can be provided in English as well, but an Arabic version is needed for official purposes or if requested by the employee. [15]

### Saudi Arabia
**Requirement level:** Mandatory (Arabic required)
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors
**Requirements:** Employment in KSA is conducted in Arabic by law. The Labor Law states that documents (contracts, disciplinary rules, etc.) shall be in Arabic. Companies often have dual-language contracts (Arabic/English), but Arabic prevails legally. Any policy not in Arabic may not be recognized by authorities. For foreign workers who don't speak Arabic, an interpreter or translated copy is typically provided (though not legally mandated). [12]

### Israel
**Requirement level:** No specific requirement (Hebrew standard; ensure comprehension)
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors (public sector bilingual)
**Requirements:** Israel has two official languages (Hebrew and Arabic), with Hebrew dominant in most workplaces. No specific labor law forces translation of documents, but employers must inform employees of employment terms in a language they understand (a principle under case law). Hebrew contracts and policies are standard. For employees who aren't Hebrew-proficient, providing Arabic or English versions is best practice. Public sector institutions often issue bilingual Hebrew-Arabic materials. [12]

### South Africa
**Requirement level:** No requirement (multilingualism respected; oral interpretation if needed)
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors
**Requirements:** South Africa has 11 official languages, but English is the primary language of business and law. No statute requires translation of employment documents. Employers typically use English for contracts and policies. However, the Constitution requires that procedures like disciplinary hearings be explained in a language the employee understands (interpreters provided if needed). Written documents can be in English by default without violating any law. [12]

### Kenya / Nigeria (example)
**Requirement level:** No specific requirements (use official language in documentation)
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors
**Requirements:** These nations use English as an official language (alongside local languages). No specific labor laws compel translation into indigenous languages. Employment contracts and HR policies are usually in English. Employers are expected to explain terms and safety rules in Kiswahili, Hausa, or other local languages if workers have limited English, but this is practice rather than legal mandate. French-speaking African countries (Senegal, Cote d'Ivoire) similarly use French for all employment matters. [12]

### Other Middle East & Africa
**Requirement level:** No broad translation mandates (use official language)
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors
**Requirements:** **Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, etc.:** Arabic is the official language and generally required for employment contracts (Egypt's labor law mandates Arabic contracts; Morocco requires French or Arabic for certain notices). **Francophone Africa:** French is the default language for employment documentation (Ivory Coast, Cameroon). **East Africa:** English (and Swahili in Tanzania/Kenya) serves as the working language; no special translation laws. Employers in these regions should use the official language(s) for written documents to ensure enforceability. Where employees speak minority languages, translations are a matter of policy rather than statute. [12]

### How does Tallyfy help organizations meet global language requirements?

Tallyfy's [Azure AI-powered content translation](/products/pro/integrations/azure-translation/) automatically translates workflow content into 100+ languages. Here's what that means in practice:

- **Maintain compliance** with local language laws - process templates and step instructions automatically appear in the right language
- **Ensure employee comprehension** of safety procedures across multilingual teams
- **Reduce translation costs** - real-time translation replaces manual document translation
- **Scale globally** without juggling dozens of template versions in different languages
- **Adapt quickly** when regulations change - update once, and it translates everywhere

The system keeps your original language version as the authoritative one while translating everything else. That way you're covered when French law says "the French version rules" or when the UAE demands Arabic takes precedence.

### What are the key compliance considerations for global organizations?

Here's the strategic playbook based on the requirements above:

1. **Identify mandatory vs. recommended jurisdictions** - countries like France, Belgium, Quebec, UAE, and Saudi Arabia enforce their language laws actively.

2. **Establish authoritative language versions** - most places let you go bilingual, but they're clear about which version wins in court.

3. **Ensure employee comprehension** - even if the law doesn't require it, making sure workers understand safety procedures in their language is good practice.

4. **Plan for enforcement variation** - France and Belgium enforce strictly. Other countries have laws on the books but rarely enforce them. Know the difference.

5. **Consider sector differences** - working with government? Expect stricter rules. Running a factory? Safety translations aren't optional.

6. **Monitor regulatory changes** - these requirements keep shifting, especially around pay transparency and AI in the workplace.
