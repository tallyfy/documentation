title: Translation requirements for process documentation
---

## Where do laws or recommendations exist to translate process content to local languages?

Important note - this article is not legal advice of any kind. You need to do your own research and use this content at your own risk.

If you're running operations across multiple countries, language requirements can quickly become a compliance nightmare. Some countries fine you for English-only documents. Others just recommend translations. This guide maps out exactly which jurisdictions require workplace content in local languages - and which ones let you slide with English.

Here's what you need to know: Organizations using workflow platforms like Tallyfy must ensure their templates and SOPs meet local language laws. Miss this, and you could face fines or unenforceable contracts.

### What types of workplace content are subject to language requirements?

These are the main categories of workplace documentation that different countries regulate:

- **Employment contracts and agreements**
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and work instructions** 
- **Safety procedures and training materials**
- **Employee handbooks and policies**
- **Disciplinary procedures and codes of conduct**
- **Form fields and data collection instruments**
- **Process templates and workflow documentation**
- **Training content and instructional materials**

Translation requirements vary wildly. France will fine you for English-only handbooks. Australia? They don't care. The spectrum runs from strict legal mandates to gentle suggestions that you help employees understand what they're reading.

## North America

### Canada (Federal)
**Requirement Level:** Mandatory (public sector); No specific law (private sector)  
**Applies to:** Public sector (federal government); Private sector has no specific requirements  
**Requirements:** The federal Official Languages Act mandates bilingual English and French communication in federal institutions. Federal employees in designated bilingual regions have the right to work and receive documents in their official language of choice. Private-sector workplaces outside Quebec have no translation requirements. [2]

### Canada – Québec  
**Requirement Level:** Mandatory  
**Applies to:** All employers (private and public) in Quebec  
**Requirements:** The Charter of the French Language (Bill 96) mandates French as the language of work. All written communications to employees - including offers, contracts, policies, and training materials - must be provided in French unless an employee specifically requests another language. Pre-existing English documents had to be translated by June 1, 2023. This requirement applies even if only one employee is in Quebec. Non-compliance can result in fines. [1]

### Canada – Other Provinces
**Requirement Level:** No specific law (use official language)  
**Applies to:** Private sector (English or French by practice); Public sector (bilingual in New Brunswick)  
**Requirements:** No province outside Quebec requires employee documents in a language other than English. Documents are typically in English or French in francophone areas. New Brunswick mandates bilingual public services but has no specific translation requirement for private employers' internal documents. [2]

### United States (Federal)
**Requirement Level:** Mandatory for safety/rights information comprehension; no blanket requirement otherwise  
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors (for OSHA and federal notices)  
**Requirements:** No general law requires workplace document translation, but employers must convey certain information in a language employees understand. OSHA regulations require safety training and hazard communications in comprehensible language and vocabulary. Federal notices (EEOC, FMLA posters) are available in Spanish and other languages - employers are encouraged or required to use them if a significant workforce portion isn't English-fluent. English-only workplace policies cannot be enforced if they impede employee rights (per EEOC rules). [3]

### United States – States  
**Requirement Level:** Mandatory for specific notices (varies by state); Recommended for other documents  
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors (state-level requirements)  
**Requirements:** California's Labor Code §2810.5 requires new-hire wage/hour notices in "the language the employer normally uses to communicate employment-related information" with the employee. California and states like New York mandate certain posters or notices in Spanish and other languages if threshold percentages of workers aren't English-proficient. While most US employment documents are in English, employers are strongly advised to provide translations (especially Spanish) for handbooks, safety training, and key policies when large portions of employees are non-English speakers. [4]

### Mexico
**Requirement Level:** Mandatory (contracts and official documents in Spanish); Recommended (policies/SOPs)  
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors  
**Requirements:** Spanish is the official language for employment relations. Employment contracts should be in Spanish to be legally valid, with Spanish versions prevailing in legal effect. Authorities require all employment documents submitted to labor authorities or courts be in Spanish or accompanied by official translation. Many companies provide bilingual Spanish-English contracts and handbooks, but Spanish text is binding. No statutory requirement exists for day-to-day communication translation, but Spanish versions of policies and safety instructions are strongly recommended for employee comprehension. [5]

### Other North America
**Requirement Level:** No specific translation laws (default to official language)  
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors  
**Requirements:** Central America and Caribbean countries (Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Dominican Republic, etc.) use their official language - Spanish in most cases, French in Haiti, English in some Caribbean states - for all employment contracts and internal documents. No specific laws mandate translation beyond the official/national language. Panama and Costa Rica generally require Spanish for labor matters; English documents should be translated if reviewed by authorities. Employers typically provide documentation in the official language. [12]

## Europe

### France
**Requirement Level:** Mandatory (French must be used for all employee documents)  
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors (labor code covers employment relationships)  
**Requirements:** The Toubon Law and Labor Code Article L.1321-6 require all documents setting out employee obligations or necessary instructions to be in French. This includes employment contracts, policies, codes of conduct, collective agreements, and even software interfaces or manuals used by employees. No clause in a foreign language can be enforced against an employee. Courts are very strict - employers have been fined for issuing English-only handbooks in France. Translations may be attached, but French is authoritative. [6]

### Belgium – Flanders (Dutch-speaking)
**Requirement Level:** Mandatory (Dutch only)  
**Applies to:** All employers (private and public) in the region  
**Requirements:** Belgian regional language laws require all employment documents and communications with employees in the Flemish region be in Dutch. Documents in another language are deemed null and void against the employer. Employees could still invoke an English clause in their favor, but employers cannot enforce it. Official work rules and contracts must be in Dutch; unofficial English translations can be provided for convenience. [7]

### Belgium – Wallonia (French-speaking)  
**Requirement Level:** Mandatory (French only)  
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors  
**Requirements:** All employment documents in the Walloon region must be in French. Using another language with employees is prohibited, and documents not in French are legally null and void. As in Flanders, an English version can be given for reference but has no legal force. [7]

### Belgium – Brussels (Bilingual)
**Requirement Level:** Mandatory (French or Dutch depending on employee)  
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors  
**Requirements:** Employment language follows the employee's language (assumed French or Dutch). Documents may be in French for Francophone employees and Dutch for Dutch-speaking employees. Employers in Brussels often provide documents in both languages. Unlike Flanders/Wallonia, the sanction for using wrong language isn't nullity; instead, employees can demand translation at employer's expense. [7]

### Luxembourg
**Requirement Level:** No mandatory language law (mutual understanding required)  
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors  
**Requirements:** No specific statutory requirement regarding employment document language. In practice, contracts and policies are usually in official languages (French, German, or Luxembourgish) or English - as long as both employer and employee understand the language used. Documents in an official language (or bilingual) are recommended for local employees. English-only contracts are common for international staff, but translations may be provided for clarity. [8]

### Germany  
**Requirement Level:** No explicit requirement (best practice to use German)  
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors (German is de facto for public sector)  
**Requirements:** German law doesn't mandate employment documents be in German. English contracts are lawful if both parties understand them. However, it's customary and prudent to provide German versions for German-speaking employees to avoid misunderstandings. Courts hold that employees must comprehend workplace rules; key instructions (safety, disciplinary rules) should be explained in German if workers aren't fluent in the foreign language. Translation is recommended as best practice but not legally required in private sector. Public sector generally requires German for official documents. [11]

### Netherlands
**Requirement Level:** No specific law (ensure employee understanding)  
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors  
**Requirements:** Dutch law doesn't require employment contracts or policies in Dutch. Employers may draft documents in English or another language if employees are comfortable with it. International companies often use English contracts. However, if workers don't understand a document's language, employers must provide explanation or translation to ensure employees are aware of their rights and obligations. In legal disputes, courts consider whether employees could comprehend terms. Providing Dutch translations is recommended to avoid ambiguity. [8]

### Spain
**Requirement Level:** Mandatory (Spanish for contracts; local language or bilingual as needed)  
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors  
**Requirements:** Spanish labor law requires employment contracts for Spanish employees be in Spanish (Castilian). Employers can provide bilingual contracts (Spanish-English), but Spanish text governs in case of conflict. Other employment documents (handbooks, safety instructions) should also be in Spanish for full effectiveness, though translations in other languages can be added. In some autonomous regions (Catalonia, Basque Country), local co-official languages may be used in addition to Spanish, but Spanish is generally sufficient legally. [10]

### Italy
**Requirement Level:** No specific requirement (Italian is standard; translation strongly advised)  
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors (public sector uses Italian)  
**Requirements:** Italian law doesn't explicitly require Italian-language employment contracts or policies for private companies. Contracts may be in a foreign language if both parties understand it. However, it's strongly recommended to draft documents in Italian (or provide Italian translations) when employing local staff, because all legal proceedings and official dealings will be in Italian. In disputes, courts might favor Italian text interpretation or require certified translation of foreign-language documents. Public sector and official documents are always in Italian. [8]

### Poland
**Requirement Level:** Mandatory (Polish required; bilingual allowed)  
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors  
**Requirements:** The Polish Language Act (amended 2011) imposes statutory requirement to prepare employment documents in Polish for them to be binding. Employment contracts, agreements, and internal work regulations must be in Polish (though bilingual versions are allowed). If bilingual versions are used, Polish text prevails in case of discrepancies. Employees may request documents in another language in addition to Polish, but Polish remains the legal reference. Foreign employees who don't speak Polish are generally given unofficial translations for convenience, but the official version is Polish. [9]

### Czech Republic
**Requirement Level:** No specific law (Czech used customarily)  
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors  
**Requirements:** No law requires Czech language for employment documents. The Labor Code allows agreements in other languages if both parties agree and understand them. In practice, most employment contracts and policies with local staff are in Czech to ensure understanding and compliance with Czech labor standards. Providing documents in Czech is highly recommended, especially since court or authority proceedings need Czech versions. Official communications to government must be in Czech. [8]

### Hungary
**Requirement Level:** No specific law (use Hungarian for clarity)  
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors  
**Requirements:** Hungarian law doesn't mandate Hungarian language use in employment contracts or internal policies. Employers and employees are free to choose another language if mutually understood. However, since Hungarian employees have a right to understand their working conditions, employers usually provide documents in Hungarian. Authorities and courts require Hungarian translations of foreign-language documents in official processes. While not mandatory by statute, using Hungarian or bilingual documents is the norm. [8]

### Romania
**Requirement Level:** Mandatory for contracts (Romanian); others recommended  
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors  
**Requirements:** Under the Labor Code, individual employment contracts must be concluded in Romanian (even if foreign language versions are also provided). However, accompanying documents (internal rules, job descriptions) aren't legally required to be in Romanian as long as employees understand them. In practice, most HR documents are in Romanian. For foreign staff, companies might use bilingual formats. The key point is that main contracts are in the national language. [8]

### Slovenia
**Requirement Level:** Mandatory (Slovenian required)  
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors  
**Requirements:** All employment documents (contracts, policies, internal instructions) must be in Slovenian by law. They may be bilingual, but Slovene must be one of the languages. Even internal communications related to employees' rights and safety must be conducted in Slovene. This is strictly enforced; documents not in Slovenian could be deemed non-compliant. Employers typically provide a Slovenian version with translations as needed. [8]

### Austria
**Requirement Level:** No specific law (German by practice)  
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors  
**Requirements:** Austrian law doesn't require German for employment documents, but it's implicitly expected. In practice, virtually all employment contracts and workplace policies are in German (Austria's official language). English or other language contracts aren't per se invalid if employees fully understand them, but required filings (with authorities) must be in German. To avoid disputes about comprehension, using German or bilingual format is advised. Public sector employment is conducted in German by law. [8]

### Other Europe
**Requirement Level:** Varies; mostly no mandatory rule (default to official language or mutual understanding)  
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors  
**Requirements:** **Switzerland:** No nationwide rule for private sector; companies use local official language (German, French, or Italian depending on canton) for employee documents, or English in international settings if employees agree. **Nordic Countries (Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland):** No legal mandates to use local language in contracts, but generally documents are in Swedish/Norwegian/etc. for native employees. If foreign language is used, employers should ensure employees understand terms (some countries like Finland explicitly state employees must be briefed in a comprehensible language). **United Kingdom/Ireland:** No requirement to translate policies (English is working language). However, providing translations for immigrant workers (Polish, Urdu speakers in UK) is considered good practice for health, safety and equality reasons. **Eastern Europe (Baltics, Balkans not listed above):** In many cases, official language is required for official filings and strongly recommended for contracts, but not always explicitly mandated by statute. For all these countries, no specific translation laws exist beyond the expectation that official or predominant local language is used so employees understand information. [12]

## Asia-Pacific

### China
**Requirement Level:** De facto mandatory (Chinese needed for legal enforceability)  
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors (official dealings in Chinese)  
**Requirements:** Chinese labor laws don't explicitly state "contracts must be in Chinese," but in practice Chinese (Mandarin) is required for legal and administrative purposes. All employment contracts should be executed in Chinese for legal certainty, as Chinese language contracts are generally required if disputes go to Chinese courts or documents are submitted to government agencies. Companies often sign bilingual Chinese-English contracts; however, the Chinese version will prevail legally. Internal regulations and manuals should be in Chinese or translated, since employees must comprehend them. Many multinationals provide dual-language handbooks in China. [13]

### Japan
**Requirement Level:** No explicit requirement (Japanese strongly recommended; ensure foreigners get translations)  
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors (public sector uses Japanese by law)  
**Requirements:** Japan has no specific law forcing Japanese use in private employment contracts or policies. However, because most employees are Japanese-speaking and labor disputes are handled in Japanese, it's standard practice to provide all employment terms in Japanese. Government guidance encourages that non-Japanese workers be given contracts and work rules in a language they understand (English, Portuguese for Brazilians in Japan, etc.). While not mandated, Japanese is effectively the default language for workplace documents. Foreign companies operating in Japan often prepare bilingual documents (Japanese and English) to ensure mutual understanding. [8]

### South Korea
**Requirement Level:** No specific law (Korean expected in practice)  
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors  
**Requirements:** No law explicitly requires Korean-language contracts in private sector, but Korean is the normal working language. Employment contracts, handbooks, and notices are usually in Korean. If employers provide English contracts to local employees, courts will examine whether employees truly understood them; Korean translations may be demanded in disputes. For compliance (submitting rules to authorities or for litigation), Korean versions are required. Therefore, employers should translate all key documents into Korean. [12]

### India
**Requirement Level:** No nationwide requirement (state laws on notices in local languages; ensure understanding)  
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors (state-specific in public sector too)  
**Requirements:** India has no single official language nationally (the constitution recognizes Hindi and English for official purposes). Labor laws don't mandate a particular language for employment documents across private sector. English is commonly used for contracts and policies in Indian private companies. However, many states require certain notices (standing orders, factory safety instructions) be displayed in local regional language (Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, etc.) so workers understand them. While employment contracts in English are valid, employers must ensure all employees comprehend workplace rules - which often means providing translations or explanations in local language for blue-collar workers. Government forms and public-sector employment use Hindi or relevant state language (with English translations). [12]

### Australia
**Requirement Level:** No requirement (English is standard)  
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors  
**Requirements:** Australia has no laws requiring translation of employment documents into other languages. English is the de facto language of business and employment. Even for immigrant workers, there's no statutory duty for employers to provide materials in their native language - the onus is on employees to have sufficient English or ask for clarification. For safety training, employers must ensure communication is effective, which may involve translation or interpreters if language barriers exist. The absence of legal mandate notwithstanding, some large employers choose to translate key policies into languages like Chinese or Arabic as best practice. Overall, providing documents in English is sufficient under Australian law. [12]

### New Zealand
**Requirement Level:** No requirement  
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors  
**Requirements:** New Zealand similarly has no requirement to translate employment documents. English (and Māori in some public contexts) is used for employment contracts and workplace policies. There are provisions ensuring employees understand health and safety instructions - for instance, if workers have limited English, employers should take reasonable steps to communicate in a way that person understands (which could include translation). But there's no specific statute compelling written translations. Generally, English documents are legally valid; translations to other languages are optional and done as needed for understanding. [12]

### Indonesia
**Requirement Level:** Mandatory (Indonesian required; bilingual allowed with Indonesian as official)  
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors  
**Requirements:** Indonesian language law (Law No. 24/2009) requires any agreement involving an Indonesian party be in Bahasa Indonesia. This means employment contracts with Indonesian employees must have an Indonesian version. If a foreign party is also involved (expat employee or foreign employer entity), the contract may be bilingual (Indonesian and English), but Indonesian text is authoritative. In recent guidance, Indonesia's Supreme Court opined that absence of an Indonesian version won't automatically void a contract if no bad faith is involved - but prudently, employers must comply and issue Indonesian-language contracts. All internally used documents like company regulations must be in Indonesian as well (with translations permissible alongside). [14]

### Malaysia
**Requirement Level:** No specific requirement (Malay official in public sector; flexible in private)  
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors  
**Requirements:** Malaysia's laws don't mandate a particular language for private employment contracts - English is widely used in business and acceptable legally, as is Malay (Bahasa Malaysia). In public sector and official dealings, Malay is the official language. Generally, companies ensure local employees are given Malay versions of key documents, especially for lower-wage roles. Many firms use dual-language (Malay/English) contracts. Critical employee communications (safety rules, etc.) should be explained in Malay if workers aren't fluent in English. No penalty is specified for using English only, but understanding is key under Occupational Safety guidelines. [12]

### Singapore
**Requirement Level:** No requirement (English is default business language)  
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors  
**Requirements:** Singapore has four official languages (English, Mandarin Chinese, Malay, Tamil), with English as the main working language. There's no legal requirement to translate employment materials into other languages; English employment contracts and handbooks are the norm. The government publishes some advisories and mandatory notices in multiple languages (safety posters in English, Chinese, Malay, Tamil), and employers are encouraged to communicate with workers in a language they understand (especially in construction/domestic work sectors). But legally, an English document suffices. Translations may be provided on a voluntary basis for convenience. [12]

### Other Asia-Pacific
**Requirement Level:** Varies (Vietnam/Thailand: Mandatory local language; others: recommended)  
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors  
**Requirements:** **Philippines:** English is an official language and almost all employment documents are in English; no translation law required. **Vietnam:** Labor code requires contracts with Vietnamese employees be in Vietnamese (or bilingual with Vietnamese) to be enforceable; similarly, internal labor regulations must be in Vietnamese. **Thailand:** Thai labor law expects employment agreements to be in Thai if with Thai staff; while not explicitly mandatory, Thai versions are needed for any official filings or disputes. **Middle East (see next section)**. For most other Asian countries not listed, the general pattern is that official national language should be used for employment communications to avoid legal issues, but specific translation mandates (beyond ensuring employee comprehension) are uncommon. Always consider local official language as authoritative text for legal purposes. [12]

## Middle East & Africa

### United Arab Emirates
**Requirement Level:** Mandatory (Arabic, with English translation optionally)  
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors (government forms in Arabic)  
**Requirements:** UAE labor law requires employment contracts to be in Arabic (the official language). In practice, contracts are typically bilingual Arabic-English, but the Arabic text is the legally binding version. All filings with the Ministry of Human Resources must be in Arabic. Employers must also post any required workplace notices (labor law abstracts) in Arabic. While workplace policies can be provided in English as well, an Arabic version is needed for any official purposes or if requested by the employee. [15]

### Saudi Arabia
**Requirement Level:** Mandatory (Arabic required)  
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors  
**Requirements:** Employment in KSA is conducted in Arabic by law. The Labor Law states that documents (including contracts, disciplinary rules, etc.) shall be in Arabic. Like the UAE, companies often have dual-language contracts (Arabic/English), but Arabic prevails legally. Any memorandum or policy not in Arabic may not be recognized by authorities. Employers are advised to provide workplace instructions (safety, etc.) in Arabic to all workers; for foreign workers who don't speak Arabic, typically an interpreter or translated copy is provided in addition (though not legally mandated). [12]

### Israel
**Requirement Level:** No specific requirement (Hebrew standard; ensure comprehension)  
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors (public sector bilingual)  
**Requirements:** Israel has two official languages (Hebrew and Arabic), with Hebrew dominant in most workplaces. There's no specific labor law forcing translation of documents, but employers must clearly inform employees of their employment terms in a language they understand (this is a principle under case law). In practice, Hebrew employment contracts and policies are standard. For Arab-Israeli employees or others who aren't Hebrew-proficient, providing Arabic or English versions is best practice to avoid claims of lack of notice. Official employment forms (for government filings) are in Hebrew (sometimes Arabic). Public sector institutions often issue bilingual Hebrew-Arabic materials. [12]

### South Africa
**Requirement Level:** No requirement (multilingualism respected; oral interpretation if needed)  
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors  
**Requirements:** South Africa has 11 official languages, but English is the primary language of business and law. There's no statute requiring translation of employment documents into all or any specific language. Employers typically use English for contracts and policies. However, the law and Constitution emphasize the right to use official languages and require that procedures like disciplinary hearings be explained in a language the employee understands (interpreters provided if needed). Thus, key communications should be translated or interpreted for employees who aren't fluent in English or Afrikaans. Still, written documents can be in English by default without violating any law. [12]

### Kenya / Nigeria (example)
**Requirement Level:** No specific requirements (use official colonial language in documentation)  
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors  
**Requirements:** These African nations use English as an official language (alongside local languages). No specific labor laws compel translation of documents into indigenous languages. Employment contracts and HR policies are usually in English. Employers are expected to explain terms and safety rules in Kiswahili, Hausa, or other local languages if workers have limited English, but this is a matter of practice, not explicit legal mandate. French-speaking African countries (Senegal, Côte d'Ivoire) similarly use French for all official and employment matters, following the principle that the official language governs. We did not find specific laws in these countries requiring additional translations beyond the official language. [12]

### Other Middle East & Africa
**Requirement Level:** No broad translation mandates (use official language)  
**Applies to:** Private and public sectors  
**Requirements:** **Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, etc.:** Arabic is the official language and generally required for employment contracts and official documents (Egypt's labor law mandates Arabic contracts; Morocco requires French or Arabic for certain notices, with Arabic gaining prominence legally). **Francophone Africa:** French is treated as the default language for employment documentation (Ivory Coast, Cameroon - French contracts are standard). **East Africa:** English (and Swahili in Tanzania/Kenya) serves as the working language; no special translation laws. **Overall**, employers in these regions should use the official language(s) for written documents to ensure enforceability. No country in our research explicitly required providing internal policies in multiple languages by law except as noted above. Where employees speak minority languages, translations are a matter of policy or collective agreement rather than statute. [12]

### How does Tallyfy help organizations meet global language requirements?

Tallyfy's [Azure AI-powered content translation](/products/pro/integrations/azure-translation/) tackles this compliance headache by automatically translating workflow content into 100+ languages. Here's what it does for you:

- **Maintain compliance** with local language laws - your process templates and step instructions automatically appear in the right language
- **Ensure employee comprehension** of safety procedures across multilingual teams (yes, it's that straightforward)  
- **Reduce translation costs** - real-time translation beats paying for manual document translation every time
- **Scale globally** without juggling dozens of template versions in different languages
- **Adapt quickly** when regulations change - update once, and it translates everywhere

Smart design here: The system keeps your original language version as the authoritative one while translating everything else. That way you're covered when French law says "the French version rules" or when the UAE demands Arabic takes precedence.

### What are the key compliance considerations for global organizations?

After digging through all these requirements, here's your strategic playbook:

1. **Identify mandatory vs. recommended jurisdictions** - Put your money where the fines are. Countries like France, Belgium, Quebec, UAE, and Saudi Arabia don't mess around.

2. **Establish authoritative language versions** - Most places let you go bilingual, but they're crystal clear about which version wins in court

3. **Ensure employee comprehension** - Look, even if the law doesn't require it, making sure your warehouse workers understand safety procedures in their language just makes sense

4. **Plan for enforcement variation** - France and Belgium will nail you. Other countries have laws on the books but rarely enforce them. Know the difference.

5. **Consider sector differences** - Working with government? Expect stricter rules. Running a factory? Safety translations aren't optional.

6. **Monitor regulatory changes** - These requirements keep shifting, especially around pay transparency and AI in the workplace
