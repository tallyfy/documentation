title: Global workplace language requirements for process documentation
---

## Where do laws or recommendations exist to translate process content to local languages?

Important note - this article is not legal advice of any kind. You need to do your own research and use this content at your own risk.

Understanding global language requirements for workplace documentation is essential for multinational organizations implementing standardized processes, SOPs, and employee communications. This comprehensive analysis examines countries where translation of process content is either mandated by law or strongly recommended for compliance and operational effectiveness.

Many organizations using workflow management platforms like Tallyfy need to ensure their templates, process documentation, and standard operating procedures comply with local language requirements across different jurisdictions where they operate.

### What types of workplace content are subject to language requirements?

Different countries regulate various categories of workplace documentation that organizations typically standardize in workflow management systems:

- **Employment contracts and agreements**
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and work instructions** 
- **Safety procedures and training materials**
- **Employee handbooks and policies**
- **Disciplinary procedures and codes of conduct**
- **Form fields and data collection instruments**
- **Process templates and workflow documentation**
- **Training content and instructional materials**

The level of translation requirement varies significantly by jurisdiction, ranging from absolute mandates to strong recommendations based on employee comprehension needs.

## North America

| Country/Region | Requirement Summary | Level | Sector | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Canada (Federal)** | Federal **Official Languages Act** requires bilingual (English & French) communication in federal institutions. Federal employees in designated bilingual regions have the right to work and receive documents in their official language of choice. No law requires translations in private-sector workplaces (outside Quebec). | Mandatory (public sector); N/A in private | Public (federal govt.); *Private:* No specific law | [2] |
| **Canada – Québec** | The **Charter of the French Language (Bill 96)** mandates French as the language of work. *All* written communications to employees (offers, contracts, policies, training materials, etc.) must be provided in French (unless an employee **requests** another language). Pre-existing English documents had to be translated by June 1, 2023. This requirement is triggered even if only one employee is in Quebec. Non-compliance can result in fines. | **Mandatory** | Private & Public (all employers in Quebec) | [1] |
| **Canada – Other Provinces** | No province (outside Quebec) has a law requiring employee documents to be in a language other than English. In practice, documents are usually in English (or French in francophone areas). New Brunswick, as a bilingual province, mandates bilingual public services, but no specific translation requirement for private employers' internal documents was found. | *No specific law* (use official language) | Private (English or French by practice); Public (bilingual in NB) | [2] |
| **United States (Federal)** | No general law requires translation of workplace documents into other languages. However, employers **must** convey certain information in a language employees understand. For example, OSHA regulations require safety training and hazard communications to be delivered in a language and vocabulary comprehensible to employees. Many federal notices (e.g. EEOC, FMLA posters) are made available in Spanish and other languages, and employers are encouraged or required to use them if a significant portion of the workforce isn't fluent in English. English-only workplace policies *cannot* be enforced if they impede employees' rights (per EEOC rules). | **Mandatory** for safety/rights information to be understood; otherwise no blanket requirement | Private & Public (for OSHA and federal notices) | [3] |
| **United States – States** | **California:** State law (Labor Code §2810.5) requires the new-hire wage/hour notice to be given *"in the language the employer normally uses to communicate employment-related information"* to the employee. California and some other states (e.g. **New York**) also mandate that certain official posters or notices be displayed in Spanish (and other languages) if a threshold percentage of workers are not English-proficient. Overall, while most employment documents in the U.S. are in English, employers are **strongly advised** to provide translations (especially Spanish) for handbooks, safety trainings, and other key policies when a large portion of employees are non-English speakers to ensure understanding and legal compliance. | **Mandatory** for specific notices (varies by state); **Recommended** for other docs | Private & Public (state-level requirements) | [4] |
| **Mexico** | Spanish is the official language for employment relations. By law, employment contracts **should be in Spanish** to be legally valid. A Spanish version of any contract or policy will prevail in legal effect. Authorities require that all employment documents submitted (e.g. to labor authorities or courts) be in Spanish or accompanied by an official translation. In practice, many companies provide bilingual (Spanish-English) contracts and handbooks, but the Spanish text is the binding version. No statutory requirement exists for day-to-day communications to be translated, but providing Spanish versions of policies and safety instructions is **strongly recommended** to ensure employee comprehension. | **Mandatory** (contracts and official docs in Spanish); Recommended (for policies/SOPs) | Private & Public | [5] |
| **Other North America** | **Central America & Caribbean:** In countries such as Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Dominican Republic, etc., the official language (Spanish in most cases, French in Haiti, English in some Caribbean states) is used for all employment contracts and internal documents. We found *no specific laws* mandating translation beyond the official/national language. (For example, Panama and Costa Rica generally require Spanish for labor matters; any English documents should be translated if reviewed by authorities.) Employers operating in these countries typically provide Spanish (or other official language) documentation to employees. | *No specific translation laws* (default to official language) | Private & Public | [12] |

## Europe

| Country/Region | Requirement Summary | Level | Sector | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **France** | French law (the **Toubon Law** and Labor Code Article L.1321-6) requires that **all documents that set out employee obligations or necessary instructions must be in French**. This includes employment contracts, policies, codes of conduct, collective agreements, and even software interfaces or manuals used by employees. **No clause** in a foreign language can be enforced against an employee. Courts are very strict – employers have been fined for issuing English-only handbooks in France. (Translations may be attached, but French is authoritative.) | **Mandatory** (French must be used for all employee documents) | Private & Public (labor code covers employment relationships) | [6] |
| **Belgium – Flanders (Dutch-speaking)** | Belgian regional language laws require that **all employment documents and communications with employees in the Flemish region be in Dutch**. If a document is in another language, it is deemed null and void against the employer. (Employees could still invoke an English clause in their favor, but the employer cannot enforce it.) Official work rules, contracts, etc. must be in Dutch; unofficial English translations can be provided for convenience. | **Mandatory** (Dutch only) | Private & Public (all employers in region) | [7] |
| **Belgium – Wallonia (French-speaking)** | Similarly, **all employment documents in the Walloon region must be in French**. Using another language with employees is prohibited, and documents not in French are legally null and void. (As in Flanders, an English version can be given for reference but has no legal force.) | **Mandatory** (French only) | Private & Public | [7] |
| **Belgium – Brussels (Bilingual)** | In the Brussels Capital region, the rule is that the employment language follows the employee's language (assumed French or Dutch). Documents may be in French for Francophone employees and in Dutch for Dutch-speaking employees. Employers in Brussels often provide documents in both languages. Unlike Flanders/Wallonia, the sanction for using the wrong language in Brussels is not nullity; instead, an employee can demand a translation at the employer's expense. | **Mandatory** (French or Dutch depending on employee) | Private & Public | [7] |
| **Luxembourg** | There is **no specific statutory requirement** regarding language of employment documents in Luxembourg. In practice, contracts and policies are usually in one of the official languages (French, German, or Luxembourgish) or in English – **as long as both employer and employee understand the language used**. It is recommended to provide documents in an official language (or bilingual) for local employees. (English-only contracts are common for international staff, but translations may be provided for clarity.) | *No mandatory language law* (mutual understanding required) | Private & Public | [8] |
| **Germany** | German law **does not mandate** that employment documents be in German. It is lawful to have, for example, an English contract if both employer and employee understand it. However, it's customary and prudent to provide German versions of contracts and workplace policies for German-speaking employees to avoid misunderstandings. Courts have held that employees must comprehend workplace rules; thus, key instructions (safety, disciplinary rules, etc.) should be explained in German if workers aren't fluent in the foreign language. Overall, translation is **recommended** as a best practice but not a legal requirement in the private sector. (In the public sector, German is generally required for official documents.) | *No explicit requirement* (best practice to use German) | Private & Public (German is de facto for public sector) | [11] |
| **Netherlands** | Dutch law does not require employment contracts or policies to be in Dutch. Employers may draft documents in English or another language if the employee is comfortable with it. (For instance, international companies often use English contracts in the Netherlands.) However, if a worker does not understand the language of a document, the employer must provide an explanation or translation to ensure the employee is aware of their rights and obligations. In legal disputes, courts will consider whether the employee could comprehend the terms. Providing Dutch translations is **recommended** to avoid ambiguity. | *No specific law* (ensure employee understanding) | Private & Public | [8] |
| **Spain** | Spanish labor law requires that **employment contracts for Spanish employees be in Spanish** (Castilian). Employers can provide bilingual contracts (e.g. Spanish-English), but the Spanish text will govern in case of conflict. Other employment documents (handbooks, safety instructions) should also be in Spanish for them to be fully effective, though it's possible to give translations in other languages in addition. In some autonomous regions (e.g. Catalonia, Basque Country), local co-official languages may be used **in addition** to Spanish, but Spanish is generally sufficient legally. | **Mandatory** (Spanish for contracts; local language or bilingual as needed) | Private & Public | [10] |
| **Italy** | Italian law does **not explicitly require** Italian-language employment contracts or policies for private companies. Contracts may be in a foreign language if both parties understand it. However, it is strongly recommended to draft documents in Italian (or provide Italian translations) when employing local staff, because all legal proceedings and official dealings will be in Italian. In disputes, courts might favor the interpretation of Italian text or may require a certified translation of any foreign-language document. The public sector and official documents in Italy are always in Italian. | *No specific requirement* (Italian is standard; translation strongly advised) | Private & Public (public sector uses Italian) | [8] |
| **Poland** | The law (Polish Language Act, amended 2011) imposes a **statutory requirement** to prepare employment documents in Polish for them to be binding. Employment contracts, agreements, and any internal work regulations must be in Polish (though they can be bilingual). If a bilingual version is used, the **Polish text prevails** in case of discrepancies. (Employees may request documents in another language *in addition* to Polish, but Polish remains the legal reference. Foreign employees who don't speak Polish are generally given unofficial translations for convenience, but the official version is Polish.) | **Mandatory** (Polish required; bilingual allowed) | Private & Public | [9] |
| **Czech Republic** | There is *no law* requiring Czech language for employment documents. The Labor Code allows agreements in other languages if both parties agree and understand them. In practice, most employment contracts and policies with local staff are in Czech to ensure understanding and compliance with Czech labor standards. Providing documents in Czech is highly recommended, especially since any court or authority proceeding will need Czech versions. (Official communications to government must be in Czech.) | *No specific law* (Czech used customarily) | Private & Public | [8] |
| **Hungary** | Hungarian law does not mandate the use of the Hungarian language in employment contracts or internal policies. Employers and employees are free to choose another language if mutually understood. Nevertheless, since Hungarian employees have a right to understand their working conditions, employers usually provide documents in Hungarian. Authorities (and courts) will require Hungarian translations of any documents in a foreign language in an official process. So, while **not mandatory by statute**, using Hungarian or bilingual documents is the norm. | *No specific law* (use Hungarian for clarity) | Private & Public | [8] |
| **Romania** | Under the Labor Code, the **individual employment contract** must be concluded in Romanian (even if a foreign language version is also provided). However, accompanying documents (internal rules, job descriptions, etc.) are **not legally required** to be in Romanian as long as the employee understands them. In practice, most HR documents are in Romanian. For foreign staff, companies might use bilingual formats. The key point is that the main contract is in the national language. | **Mandatory** for contracts (Romanian); others: *Recommended* | Private & Public | [8] |
| **Slovenia** | **All employment documents** (contracts, policies, internal instructions) **must be in Slovenian** by law. They may be bilingual, but Slovene must be one of the languages. Even internal communications related to employees' rights and safety must be conducted in Slovene. This is strictly enforced; a document not in Slovenian could be deemed non-compliant. Employers typically provide a Slovenian version with translations as needed. | **Mandatory** (Slovenian required) | Private & Public | [8] |
| **Austria** | Austrian law does **not require** German for employment documents, but it is implicitly expected. In practice, virtually all employment contracts and workplace policies are in German (Austria's official language). An English or other language contract is not per se invalid if the employee fully understands it, but any required filings (e.g. with authorities) must be in German. To avoid disputes about comprehension, using German or a bilingual format is advised. (Public sector employment is conducted in German by law.) | *No specific law* (German by practice) | Private & Public | [8] |
| **Other Europe** | **Switzerland:** No nationwide rule for private sector; companies use the local official language (German, French, or Italian depending on canton) for employee documents, or English in international settings if employees agree. **Nordic Countries (Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland):** No legal mandates to use the local language in contracts, but generally documents are in Swedish/Norwegian/etc. for native employees. If a foreign language is used, employers should ensure employees understand their terms (some countries like Finland explicitly state employees must be briefed in a language they understand). **United Kingdom/Ireland:** No requirement to translate policies (English is the working language). However, providing translations for immigrant workers (e.g. Polish, Urdu speakers in UK) is considered good practice for health & safety and equality reasons. **Eastern Europe (Baltics, Balkans not listed above):** In many cases, the official language is required for official filings and strongly recommended for contracts, but not always explicitly mandated by statute. For all these countries, we found *no specific translation laws* beyond the expectation that the official or predominant local language is used so that employees understand the information. | Varies; mostly *no mandatory rule* (default to official language or mutual understanding) | Private & Public | [12] |

## Asia-Pacific

| Country/Region | Requirement Summary | Level | Sector | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **China** | Chinese labor laws do not explicitly state "contracts must be in Chinese," but in practice **Chinese (Mandarin)** is required for legal and administrative purposes. All employment contracts **should be executed in Chinese for legal certainty**, as Chinese language contracts are generally required if a dispute goes to a Chinese court or if documents are submitted to government agencies. Companies often sign bilingual Chinese-English contracts; however, the Chinese version will prevail legally. Internal regulations and manuals should be in Chinese or translated, since employees must comprehend them. (Many multinationals provide dual-language handbooks in China.) | **De facto Mandatory** (Chinese needed for legal enforceability) | Private & Public (official dealings in Chinese) | [13] |
| **Japan** | Japan has no specific law forcing the use of Japanese in private employment contracts or policies. However, because most employees are Japanese-speaking and labor disputes are handled in Japanese, it is **standard practice** to provide all employment terms in Japanese. The government's guidance encourages that non-Japanese workers be given contracts and work rules in a language they understand (e.g. English, Portuguese for Brazilians in Japan, etc.). Thus, while not mandated, Japanese is effectively the default language for workplace documents. Foreign companies operating in Japan often prepare bilingual documents (Japanese and English) to ensure mutual understanding. | *No explicit requirement* (Japanese strongly recommended; ensure foreigners get translations) | Private & Public (public sector uses Japanese by law) | [8] |
| **South Korea** | No law explicitly requires Korean-language contracts in the private sector, but Korean is the normal working language. Employment contracts, handbooks, and notices are usually in Korean. If an employer provides an English contract to a local employee, courts will look at whether the employee truly understood it; a Korean translation may be demanded in disputes. For compliance (e.g. submitting rules to authorities or for litigation), a Korean version is required. Therefore, employers should translate all key documents into Korean. | *No specific law* (Korean expected in practice) | Private & Public | [12] |
| **India** | India has **no single official language** nationally (the constitution recognizes Hindi and English for official purposes). Labor laws do not mandate a particular language for employment documents across private sector. English is commonly used for contracts and policies in Indian private companies. However, many states require that certain notices (e.g. standing orders, factory safety instructions) be displayed in the local regional language (such as Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, etc.) so that workers understand them. Thus, while an employment contract in English is valid, employers must ensure that **all employees comprehend** workplace rules – which often means providing translations or explanations in the local language for blue-collar workers. Government forms and public-sector employment will use Hindi or the relevant state language (with English translations). | *No nationwide requirement* (state laws on notices in local languages; ensure understanding) | Private & Public (state-specific in public sector too) | [12] |
| **Australia** | Australia has **no laws requiring translation** of employment documents into other languages. English is the de facto language of business and employment. Even for immigrant workers, there is no statutory duty for employers to provide materials in their native language – the onus is on employees to have sufficient English or ask for clarification. (That said, for safety training, employers must ensure communication is effective, which may involve translation or interpreters if language barriers exist.) The absence of a legal mandate notwithstanding, some large employers choose to translate key policies into languages like Chinese or Arabic as a best practice. Overall, providing documents in English is sufficient under Australian law. | *No requirement* (English is standard) | Private & Public | [12] |
| **New Zealand** | New Zealand similarly has no requirement to translate employment documents. English (and Māori in some public contexts) is used for employment contracts and workplace policies. There are provisions ensuring employees understand health and safety instructions – for instance, if a worker has limited English, employers should take reasonable steps to communicate in a way that person understands (which could include translation). But there is no specific statute compelling written translations. Generally, English documents are legally valid; translations to other languages are optional and done as needed for understanding. | *No requirement* | Private & Public | [12] |
| **Indonesia** | **Indonesian language law (Law No. 24/2009)** requires that any **agreement involving an Indonesian party be in Bahasa Indonesia**. This means employment contracts with Indonesian employees must have an Indonesian version. If a foreign party is also involved (e.g. an expat employee or a foreign employer entity), the contract *may* be bilingual (Indonesian and English), but the Indonesian text is authoritative. In recent guidance, Indonesia's Supreme Court opined that the absence of an Indonesian version won't automatically void a contract **if** no bad faith is involved – but prudently, employers must comply and issue Indonesian-language contracts. All internally used documents like company regulations must be in Indonesian as well (with translations permissible alongside). | **Mandatory** (Indonesian required; bilingual allowed with Indonesian as official) | Private & Public | [14] |
| **Malaysia** | Malaysia's laws do not mandate a particular language for private employment contracts – English is widely used in business and is acceptable legally, as is Malay (Bahasa Malaysia). In the public sector and official dealings, Malay is the official language. Generally, companies ensure local employees are given Malay versions of key documents, especially for lower-wage roles. Many firms use dual-language (Malay/English) contracts. Critical employee communications (safety rules, etc.) should be explained in Malay if workers aren't fluent in English. No penalty is specified for using English only, but understanding is key under Occupational Safety guidelines. | *No specific requirement* (Malay official in public sector; flexible in private) | Private & Public | [12] |
| **Singapore** | Singapore has four official languages (English, Mandarin Chinese, Malay, Tamil), with English as the main working language. There is no legal requirement to translate employment materials into other languages; English employment contracts and handbooks are the norm. The government publishes some advisories and mandatory notices in multiple languages (for example, safety posters in English, Chinese, Malay, Tamil), and employers are encouraged to communicate with workers in a language they understand (especially in construction/domestic work sectors). But legally, an English document suffices. Translations may be provided on a voluntary basis for convenience. | *No requirement* (English is default business language) | Private & Public | [12] |
| **Other Asia-Pacific** | **Philippines:** English is an official language and almost all employment documents are in English; no translation law required. **Vietnam:** Labor code requires that contracts with Vietnamese employees be in Vietnamese (or bilingual with Vietnamese) to be enforceable; similarly, internal labor regulations must be in Vietnamese. **Thailand:** Thai labor law expects employment agreements to be in Thai if with Thai staff; while not explicitly mandatory, Thai versions are needed for any official filings or disputes. **Middle East (see next section)**. For most other Asian countries not listed, the general pattern is that the official national language should be used for employment communications to avoid legal issues, but specific translation mandates (beyond ensuring employee comprehension) are uncommon. Always consider the local official language as the authoritative text for legal purposes. | Varies (Vietnam/Thailand: **Mandatory** local language; others: recommended) | Private & Public | [12] |

## Middle East & Africa

| Country/Region | Requirement Summary | Level | Sector | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **United Arab Emirates** | UAE labor law requires employment contracts to be in **Arabic** (the official language). In practice, contracts are typically bilingual Arabic-English, but the Arabic text is the legally binding version. All filings with the Ministry of Human Resources must be in Arabic. Employers must also post any required workplace notices (e.g. labor law abstracts) in Arabic. While workplace policies can be provided in English as well, an Arabic version is needed for any official purposes or if requested by the employee. | **Mandatory** (Arabic, with English translation optionally) | Private & Public (govt forms in Arabic) | [15] |
| **Saudi Arabia** | Employment in KSA is conducted in **Arabic** by law. The Labor Law states that documents (including contracts, disciplinary rules, etc.) **shall be in Arabic**. Like the UAE, companies often have dual-language contracts (Arabic/English), but Arabic prevails legally. Any memorandum or policy not in Arabic may not be recognized by authorities. Employers are advised to provide workplace instructions (safety, etc.) in Arabic to all workers; for foreign workers who don't speak Arabic, typically an interpreter or translated copy is provided in addition (though not legally mandated). | **Mandatory** (Arabic required) | Private & Public | [12] |
| **Israel** | Israel has two official languages (Hebrew and Arabic), with Hebrew dominant in most workplaces. There is no specific labor law forcing translation of documents, but employers must **clearly inform employees of their employment terms in a language they understand** (this is a principle under case law). In practice, Hebrew employment contracts and policies are standard. For Arab-Israeli employees or others who are not Hebrew-proficient, providing Arabic or English versions is a best practice to avoid claims of lack of notice. Official employment forms (for government filings) are in Hebrew (sometimes Arabic). Public sector institutions often issue bilingual Hebrew-Arabic materials. | *No specific requirement* (Hebrew standard; ensure comprehension) | Private & Public (public sector bilingual) | [12] |
| **South Africa** | South Africa has 11 official languages, but English is the primary language of business and law. There is no statute requiring translation of employment documents into all or any specific language. Employers typically use English for contracts and policies. However, the law (and Constitution) emphasizes the right to use official languages and requires that **procedures like disciplinary hearings** be explained in a language the employee understands (interpreters provided if needed). Thus, key communications should be translated or interpreted for employees who aren't fluent in English or Afrikaans. Still, written documents can be in English by default without violating any law. | *No requirement* (multilingualism respected; oral interpretation if needed) | Private & Public | [12] |
| **Kenya** / **Nigeria** (example) | These African nations use English as an official language (alongside local languages). No specific labor laws compel translation of documents into indigenous languages. Employment contracts and HR policies are usually in English. Employers are expected to explain terms and safety rules in Kiswahili, Hausa, or other local languages if workers have limited English, but this is a matter of practice, not explicit legal mandate. French-speaking African countries (e.g. **Senegal**, **Côte d'Ivoire**) similarly use French for all official and employment matters, following the principle that the official language governs. We did **not find specific laws** in these countries requiring additional translations beyond the official language. | *No specific requirements* (use official colonial language in documentation) | Private & Public | [12] |
| **Other Middle East & Africa** | **Egypt, Morocco, Jordan, etc.:** Arabic is the official language and generally required for employment contracts and official documents (e.g. Egypt's labor law mandates Arabic contracts; Morocco requires French or Arabic for certain notices, with Arabic gaining prominence legally). **Francophone Africa:** French is treated as the default language for employment documentation (e.g. Ivory Coast, Cameroon – French contracts are standard). **East Africa:** English (and Swahili in Tanzania/Kenya) serves as the working language; no special translation laws. **Overall**, employers in these regions should use the official language(s) for written documents to ensure enforceability. No country in our research explicitly required providing internal policies in multiple languages by law *except as noted above*. Where employees speak minority languages, translations are a matter of policy or collective agreement rather than statute. | *No broad translation mandates* (use official language) | Private & Public | [12] |

### How does Tallyfy help organizations meet global language requirements?

Tallyfy's [Azure AI-powered content translation](/products/pro/integrations/azure-translation/) addresses these global compliance challenges by automatically translating workflow content across over 100 languages. This feature enables organizations to:

- **Maintain compliance** with local language requirements by automatically translating process templates and step instructions
- **Ensure employee comprehension** of safety procedures and work instructions across multilingual teams  
- **Reduce translation costs** by providing real-time content translation instead of manual document translation services
- **Scale globally** while meeting diverse regional language requirements without managing multiple template versions
- **Adapt quickly** to changing regulations by updating process content that automatically translates for all users

The system translates user-generated content (task descriptions, comments, form responses) while maintaining the original authoritative language version for compliance purposes, addressing the common legal requirement that one language version takes precedence.

### What are the key compliance considerations for global organizations?

Based on this analysis, organizations should consider these strategic approaches:

1. **Identify mandatory vs. recommended jurisdictions** - Focus compliance resources on countries with strict legal requirements (France, Belgium, Quebec, UAE, Saudi Arabia, etc.)

2. **Establish authoritative language versions** - Many jurisdictions allow bilingual documents but specify which language version is legally binding

3. **Ensure employee comprehension** - Even where not legally mandated, ensuring employees understand safety procedures and rights in their native language is both ethical and practical

4. **Plan for enforcement variation** - Some countries strictly enforce language requirements (France, Belgium) while others have requirements but limited enforcement

5. **Consider sector differences** - Public sector requirements are often stricter than private sector, and safety-sensitive roles may have additional translation obligations

6. **Monitor regulatory changes** - Language requirements continue evolving, particularly around pay transparency, worker rights, and AI usage in the workplace
