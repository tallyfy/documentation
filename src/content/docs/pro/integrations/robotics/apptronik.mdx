## How Tallyfy could work with Apollo robots

Apptronik's Apollo is a humanoid robot built for industrial use - standing 5'8" tall and able to lift 55 pounds. It's currently being tested in pilot programs with Mercedes-Benz and GXO Logistics. Google's Gemini integration gives Apollo AI capabilities, but it doesn't have dynamic workflow management for enterprise-scale deployments. That's where Tallyfy fits in.

## Apollo hardware and software

### Hardware specs

- **Height**: 1.73 meters (5'8")
- **Weight**: 72.6 kg (160 lbs)
- **Payload**: 25 kg (55 lbs)
- **Battery**: Hot-swappable packs, 4-hour runtime each
- **Actuators**: Electric linear actuators for human-like movement
- **Safety**: Force control architecture for human collaboration
- **Vision**: Stereoscopic cameras for depth perception
- **Displays**: E-Ink mouth display and OLED chest screen

### Software platform

- **Operating system**: RT Linux for real-time control
- **Framework**: ROS (Robot Operating System)
- **Interface**: Point-and-click programming
- **AI integration**: Google Gemini (vision-language-action model)

### Current deployments

Apptronik has announced pilot programs with these companies:

- **Mercedes-Benz**: Automotive manufacturing facilities (pilot phase)
- **GXO Logistics**: Warehouse operations proof-of-concept (pilot phase)
- **Jabil**: Manufacturing partnership for electronics production

All deployments remain in pilot phase, with commercial scaling planned as the technology matures.

## Workflow gaps Tallyfy could fill

### Static task programming

Apollo robots run pre-programmed tasks configured through their control interface. When they hit a scenario outside programmed parameters, they stop and wait for manual updates.

**Example**: An Apollo sorting packages encounters a new product category. Without handling parameters for it, the robot stops and waits for an operator to update its configuration.

**With Tallyfy**: Apollo could query Tallyfy's REST API for procedures on the fly - receiving handling instructions, weight limits, and destination zones without stopping operations.

### Individual robot configuration

Each Apollo operates with its own task configuration. When one robot discovers a better approach, that knowledge doesn't automatically spread to other units in the fleet. Updates require manual configuration of each robot.

**With Tallyfy**: Centralize all procedures in Tallyfy so every robot accesses the same knowledge base. Update once, and it propagates across the fleet automatically.

### Manual compliance documentation

Apollo logs movement and task data but doesn't automatically track which procedure version was executed or maintain audit trails for regulatory compliance.

**With Tallyfy**: Launch validated processes in Tallyfy that document each step with parameters, creating automatic audit trails for compliance.

## How Apollo currently works

Apollo uses a point-and-click interface for task programming. This simplifies configuration compared to traditional industrial robots, but tasks still need parameter setup for each application.

Google's Gemini integration handles perception and planning - identifying objects and planning movements. But business rules and procedures have to be defined separately.

With multiple Apollo robots, organizations need to manage task configurations across units, handle procedure updates, track performance, and maintain compliance documentation. As deployments scale, centralized procedure management becomes important for consistency across the fleet.

## Integration architecture

### How the pieces connect

```d2
Apollo: Apollo Robot
Gemini: Gemini AI
ROS: ROS Control
Gateway: Tallyfy Gateway
Tallyfy: Tallyfy Platform

Apollo -> ROS: Execute tasks
ROS -> Gateway: Query procedure
Gateway -> Tallyfy: API request
Tallyfy -> Gateway: Return SOP
Gateway -> ROS: Translate steps
ROS -> Apollo: Control actions

Apollo -> Gemini: Vision input
Gemini -> ROS: Planning output

ROS -> Gateway: Report status
Gateway -> Tallyfy: Update process
```

**What to notice:**
- A ROS bridge connects Apollo's control system to Tallyfy's API
- The gateway translates between ROS messages and Tallyfy procedures
- Gemini handles perception while Tallyfy manages workflow
- Process status updates flow back to Tallyfy for tracking

### Technical approach

The integration would use a ROS bridge to connect Apollo's control system with Tallyfy's REST API. Here's what that looks like in practice:

**ROS integration layer** - A ROS package that subscribes to Apollo task requests, queries Tallyfy for procedure steps, translates them into ROS action sequences, and reports completion status back.

**Procedure management** - Store standard operating procedures as Tallyfy templates. Launch processes when Apollo begins tasks. Track step completion with timestamps and parameters.

**Fleet coordination** - A central procedure repository that all robots access. Updates propagate automatically. Performance data gets aggregated across the fleet, and compliance documentation is generated along the way.

## Where this applies

### Manufacturing

Apollo robots in manufacturing could pull centralized work instructions from Tallyfy, maintain version-controlled procedures for quality management, and automatically document all tasks performed - particularly useful for regulated industries.

### Warehouse operations

In logistics, Tallyfy integration could provide dynamic routing based on current conditions, standardized handling procedures across the robot fleet, and real-time visibility into task progress.

### Regulated industries

For pharmaceutical or food production, the integration offers version-controlled validated procedures, complete audit trails, deviation tracking, and batch record generation with all parameters documented.

## What each platform brings

**Apollo handles**: Physical task execution, object recognition, safe human collaboration, and mobile manipulation.

**Tallyfy handles**: Centralized procedure management, audit trails and compliance documentation, process coordination across multiple robots, and business rule enforcement.

Organizations deploying Apollo with Tallyfy could expect reduced time managing robot configurations, consistent procedures across the fleet, automatic compliance documentation, and faster adaptation to procedure changes.

## Getting started

1. **Assessment** - Document current robot task configurations and workflows
2. **Planning** - Identify procedures suitable for centralized management
3. **Pilot** - Test integration with a limited deployment before scaling
4. **Documentation** - Create procedure templates in Tallyfy
5. **Training** - Make sure operators understand the integrated system
6. **Scaling** - Expand based on pilot results

You'll also need Apollo robots with ROS access, network connectivity for API communication, a Tallyfy organization with API access, and a testing environment.

## Apollo commercial status

Apptronik has raised significant funding (reported Series A over $350 million) to scale Apollo production. The company is demonstrating useful work with early customers, with full commercialization planned as the technology proves itself in pilot deployments.

Tallyfy integration development would align with Apollo's commercial availability timeline.
