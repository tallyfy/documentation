## Spot robots and workflow management gaps

Boston Dynamics Spot is deployed in over 1,500 locations worldwide, mostly for industrial inspection and monitoring. The robot uses Orbit fleet management software for mission recording and data collection. This article covers workflow gaps and potential integration approaches.

## What Boston Dynamics provides today

**Hardware:**
- **Spot robot**: Starting at roughly $75,000 for the base Explorer Kit (total cost often exceeds $100,000 with attachments)
- **Battery life**: About 90 minutes per charge
- **Payload capacity**: 14kg
- **Mobility**: 1.6 m/s top speed, climbs stairs, handles rough terrain
- **Temperature range**: Operates up to 55C

**Software:**
- **Orbit**: Fleet management, data collection, and AI-powered analysis (formerly Scout)
- **AI visual inspections**: Detects anomalies like debris, spills, or corrosion automatically
- **Site View**: Creates digital twins from 360-degree images for remote monitoring
- **Spot SDK**: Python and C++ APIs for custom development
- **Autowalk**: Record missions by walking routes, then replay them autonomously
- **API and webhooks**: Connect to third-party enterprise systems

**Deployment scale:**
- Over 1,500 Spot robots deployed worldwide
- Millions of automated data captures performed
- Active in over 35 countries

## Workflow gaps in current Spot deployments

### Static mission recordings

Spot missions work by recording paths and actions, then playing them back. From Boston Dynamics' SDK docs, missions follow a "go here, do this" pattern - a linear series of actions at defined locations.

What's missing:
- Missions play back identically each time - no conditional logic based on findings
- Facility layout changes require re-recording missions
- Each mission is a separate file to maintain

### No cross-site knowledge sharing

Each Spot deployment runs independently. Inspection improvements at one facility don't transfer to others, mission files aren't shared between sites, and each deployment recreates similar missions from scratch. There's no centralized procedure repository.

### Weak procedure documentation

Orbit tracks mission execution and collects sensor data, timestamps, robot paths, and images. It also provides basic AI anomaly detection. But it doesn't capture procedural context for why actions were taken, doesn't version-control inspection procedures, and doesn't produce standardized compliance reporting across facilities.

## How Spot missions work

### Autowalk mission structure

Spot uses Autowalk for autonomous navigation. An operator drives Spot through a facility using a controller while the robot records waypoints and navigation data. This creates a `.walk` file with a linear series of actions - "go to location A, perform action 1, go to location B, perform action 2."

During playback, the robot follows recorded waypoints autonomously with basic obstacle avoidance. If the environment changes significantly, the mission may fail and need re-recording.

At scale, organizations manage dozens or hundreds of mission files per facility. Layout changes require updating affected missions, and there's no built-in system for sharing procedures across sites.

## Potential workflow integration approach

A workflow platform could complement Orbit by adding a procedure layer:

- Centralized inspection procedure repository with version control
- Cross-facility procedure sharing
- Compliance documentation templates

Integration would happen through Orbit's API for mission status and data, webhook notifications when missions complete, custom mission actions calling external APIs, and post-mission workflow triggers.

```d2
Spot Robot: Spot Robot
Orbit API: Orbit API
Workflow System: Workflow Platform
Compliance: Compliance System

Mission: {
  Start: Mission Start
  Execute: Execute Mission
  Complete: Mission Complete
}

Start -> Execute
Execute -> Complete
Complete -> Orbit API: Mission data
Orbit API -> Workflow System: Webhook notification
Workflow System -> Workflow System: Launch inspection process
Workflow System -> Compliance: Document procedure followed
```

**What to notice:**
- Orbit handles robot operations and data collection
- The workflow platform manages procedures and compliance
- Integration happens through APIs and webhooks

## Real-world Spot deployments

**Industrial inspection:**
- National Grid uses Spot at substations, including high-voltage facilities where people can't enter during operation
- AB InBev deployed Spot in their Leuven brewery as part of their "Brewery of the Future" program
- Purina integrates Spot into predictive maintenance workflows

**Hazardous environments:**
- UKAEA deployed Spot at Chernobyl with a radiation detection payload
- Nuclear facilities use Spot in areas with radiation or other hazards
- Chemical plants deploy Spot for dangerous area monitoring

**At scale:**
- Spots have automated over 1 million data captures
- Fleet takes a tumble roughly once every 50 kilometers
- Used for acoustic leak detection, vibration monitoring, and thermal inspections

## Available integration options

**Orbit capabilities:**
- REST API for programmatic data access
- Webhook notifications for real-time events
- Low-code work order generation (beta)
- Integration with enterprise asset management systems
- Cloud deployment available globally

**Custom development:**
- Spot SDK provides Python and C++ APIs
- Mission customization through Autowalk extensions
- Custom payloads can connect to external systems
