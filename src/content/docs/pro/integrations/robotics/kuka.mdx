## KUKA robots and workflow management

KUKA manufactures industrial robots ranging from 6kg collaborative robots to 1300kg heavy-duty systems. While KUKA provides robust motion control and programming tools, managing procedures and documentation across robot fleets often requires additional workflow systems.

## KUKA robot ecosystem overview

### Current hardware platforms

KUKA's lineup includes several robot families:

- **LBR iiwa**: Collaborative 7-axis robots for sensitive assembly tasks
- **KR AGILUS**: Light payload robots (6-10kg) for electronics and precision work
- **KR SCARA**: High-precision robots (6-12kg) with 0.02mm accuracy
- **KR QUANTEC**: Versatile robots with 120-300kg payload capacity
- **KR FORTEC**: Heavy-duty robots handling 240-600kg
- **KR 1000 TITAN**: Ultra-heavy robots up to 1300kg payload

### Software and programming tools

**iiQKA.OS2** (launched April 2025):
- Web-based programming interface
- Virtual robot controller for simulation
- AI-ready architecture with optional NVIDIA expansion board
- Compatible with existing KRL programs

**KUKA.WorkVisual** (current version 6.0.33):
- Offline programming and configuration
- Field bus setup and I/O mapping
- Virtual commissioning capabilities

**SmartPAD 2.0**:
- Teach pendant for manual programming
- Over 250,000 units currently deployed
- Cable-connected for safety-rated operation

**KUKA Robot Language (KRL)**:
- Pascal-based programming language
- Precise motion control optimized for KUKA hardware
- Consists of .src (movement commands) and .dat (position data) file pairs

## How KUKA programs are deployed

### Traditional KRL programming approach

KUKA robots execute programs written in KRL, which requires two files with identical names:

- `.src` file: Contains movement commands and logic
- `.dat` file: Stores position data and variables

Programs are loaded onto robot controllers through several methods:

1. **USB transfer**: Programs copied to USB drives and loaded via controller interface
2. **Network deployment**: Transfer via Ethernet using KUKA.WorkVisual
3. **Teach pendant**: Direct programming on the smartPAD device

Each robot controller stores programs locally in the KRC/R1/Programs directory.

### Programming methods

**Teach pendant programming**: Manual guidance of robot through positions - time-intensive but doesn't require external tools.

**Offline programming**: Create and test programs in simulation before deployment. KUKA.Sim 4.0 enables virtual commissioning and validation.

**Hand guiding**: KUKA's ready2_pilot system uses a 6D joystick for intuitive position teaching.

**Text-based KRL**: Direct code writing for programmers familiar with Pascal-like syntax.

**Python integration**: KUKA.PythonCore module enables Python-based programming alongside traditional KRL.

## Integration protocols available

KUKA robots support standard industrial communication:

- **PROFINET**: Industrial Ethernet protocol
- **EtherCAT**: Real-time fieldbus system
- **OPC UA**: Machine-to-machine communication standard
- **KUKA.PLC mxAutomation**: Direct control from Siemens and Rockwell PLCs

## Workflow management gaps

### Challenges in multi-robot deployments

When managing multiple KUKA robots, common operational challenges include:

**Program version control**: Each robot may run different versions of the same program, making standardization difficult.

**Procedure documentation**: Robot execution data (coordinates, timestamps) doesn't automatically link to standard operating procedures or work instructions.

**Knowledge sharing**: Optimizations discovered on one robot require manual propagation to other units.

**Audit trails**: Connecting robot actions to compliance requirements and quality documentation requires separate systems.

**Dynamic updates**: Changing procedures across a robot fleet involves updating programs on each controller individually.

## Potential Tallyfy integration approach

Tallyfy could serve as a workflow layer above KUKA's motion control system, addressing documentation and procedure management.

### Integration architecture concept

KUKA Robot: KUKA Robot {
  style.fill: "#f2faf4"
}
KRC: Robot Controller {
  style.fill: "#f2faf4"
}
Middleware: Integration Layer {

Tallyfy: Tallyfy Platform {

  }
  Middleware -> KRC: Parameter updates {
    style.stroke: "#225930"
    style.stroke-dash: 3
  }
}
```

### What Tallyfy could provide

**Procedure documentation**: Link robot tasks to documented SOPs and work instructions.

**Process tracking**: Monitor which procedures each robot executes and when.

**Audit trails**: Maintain compliance records connecting robot actions to quality requirements.

**Fleet visibility**: Dashboard showing all robots and their current process status.

**Knowledge base**: Central repository for procedures accessible across all robots.

### Integration requirements

Technical prerequisites for integration:

- KUKA robots with KRC2, KRC4, or KRC5 controllers
- Network connectivity (Ethernet required)
- OPC UA or KUKA.Connect for data exchange
- Middleware to translate between KUKA protocols and Tallyfy API
- Tallyfy organization with API access enabled

## Implementation considerations

### Assessment phase

Before implementing workflow integration:

1. Document current KRL programs and associated procedures
2. Identify which processes require audit trails or compliance tracking
3. Evaluate network infrastructure for robot connectivity
4. Determine integration points between KUKA controllers and external systems

### Technical integration options

**Option 1: Read-only monitoring** - Track robot status and link to Tallyfy processes without modifying robot programs.

**Option 2: Bidirectional integration** - Robot reports completion status; Tallyfy provides procedure parameters.

**Option 3: Full workflow control** - Tallyfy initiates robot programs based on process triggers.

### Cost and timeline

Integration complexity varies based on approach:

- **Read-only monitoring**: Lower complexity, faster deployment
- **Bidirectional integration**: Moderate complexity, requires middleware development
- **Full workflow control**: Higher complexity, extensive testing required

KUKA robots represent significant capital investment (typically $150,000-$300,000 per unit including integration). Workflow management integration is a smaller incremental cost focused on operational efficiency.

## Technical requirements summary

For workflow integration with KUKA robots:

- **Controllers**: KRC2, KRC4, or KRC5
- **Connectivity**: Ethernet network access
- **Protocols**: OPC UA or KUKA.Connect preferred
- **Middleware**: Custom or third-party integration layer
- **Tallyfy access**: API-enabled organization
