## KUKA robots and workflow management

KUKA makes industrial robots ranging from 6kg collaborative models to 1300kg heavy-duty systems. Their motion control and programming tools are strong, but managing procedures and documentation across robot fleets typically requires a separate workflow system.

## KUKA robot families and software

### Hardware platforms

KUKA's lineup includes several robot families:

- **LBR iiwa** - Collaborative 7-axis robots for sensitive assembly tasks
- **KR AGILUS** - Light payload robots (6-10kg) for electronics and precision work
- **KR SCARA** - High-precision robots (6-12kg) with 0.02mm accuracy
- **KR QUANTEC** - Mid-range robots with 120-300kg payload capacity
- **KR FORTEC** - Heavy-duty robots handling 240-600kg
- **KR 1000 TITAN** - Ultra-heavy robots up to 1300kg payload

### Software and programming tools

**iiQKA.OS2** - Web-based programming interface with a virtual robot controller for simulation. Supports AI-ready architecture with an optional NVIDIA expansion board, and it's compatible with existing KRL programs.

**KUKA.WorkVisual** - Offline programming and configuration tool. Handles field bus setup, I/O mapping, and virtual commissioning.

**SmartPAD 2.0** - Teach pendant for manual programming. Cable-connected for safety-rated operation.

**KUKA Robot Language (KRL)** - Pascal-based programming language tuned for KUKA hardware. Each program consists of paired .src (movement commands) and .dat (position data) files.

## How KUKA programs are deployed

KUKA robots run programs written in KRL. Each program needs two files with identical names:

- `.src` file - Movement commands and logic
- `.dat` file - Position data and variables

Programs get loaded onto controllers in a few ways:

1. **USB transfer** - Copy to a USB drive and load through the controller interface
2. **Network deployment** - Transfer via Ethernet using KUKA.WorkVisual
3. **Teach pendant** - Program directly on the smartPAD device

Each controller stores programs locally in the KRC/R1/Programs directory.

### Programming methods

**Teach pendant** - Manually guide the robot through positions. Time-intensive but doesn't require external tools.

**Offline programming** - Create and test programs in simulation first. KUKA.Sim handles virtual commissioning and validation.

**Hand guiding** - KUKA's ready2_pilot system uses a 6D joystick for intuitive position teaching.

**Text-based KRL** - Direct code writing for programmers familiar with Pascal-like syntax.

**Python integration** - The KUKA.PythonCore module lets you write Python alongside traditional KRL.

## Available integration protocols

KUKA robots support standard industrial communication:

- **PROFINET** - Industrial Ethernet protocol
- **EtherCAT** - Real-time fieldbus system
- **OPC UA** - Machine-to-machine communication standard
- **KUKA.PLC mxAutomation** - Direct control from Siemens and Rockwell PLCs

## Workflow gaps in multi-robot deployments

When you're managing multiple KUKA robots, these operational challenges come up often:

**Program version control** - Each robot may run a different version of the same program, making standardization difficult.

**Procedure documentation** - Robot execution data (coordinates, timestamps) doesn't automatically link to SOPs or work instructions.

**Knowledge sharing** - Improvements found on one robot require manual propagation to other units.

**Audit trails** - Connecting robot actions to compliance and quality documentation requires separate systems.

**Fleet-wide updates** - Changing procedures across a robot fleet means updating programs on each controller one by one.

## Potential Tallyfy integration approach

Tallyfy could work as a workflow layer above KUKA's motion control system - handling documentation and procedure management that KUKA's tools don't cover.

### Integration architecture concept

```d2
KUKA Robot: KUKA Robot {
  style.fill: "#f2faf4"
}
KRC: Robot Controller {
  style.fill: "#f2faf4"
}
Middleware: Integration Layer {
  style.fill: "#e1f7e6"
}
Tallyfy: Tallyfy Platform {
  style.fill: "#e1f7e6"
}
Operations: Operations Team {
  style.fill: "#f2faf4"
}

Current State: {
  label: "Current: Static Programs"

  Engineer: Engineer
  USB: USB Drive

  Engineer -> USB: Load program
  USB -> KRC: Deploy to controller
  KRC -> KUKA Robot: Execute program
}

Potential Integration: {
  label: "With Workflow Layer"

  KRC -> Middleware: Report task status {
    style.stroke: "#225930"

  Middleware -> Tallyfy: Update process {

  }

    style.stroke: "#225930"
  }
  Operations -> Tallyfy: Update procedures {
    style.stroke: "#225930"
  }
  Middleware -> KRC: Parameter updates {
    style.stroke: "#225930"
    style.stroke-dash: 3
  }
}
```

### What Tallyfy could provide

**Procedure documentation** - Link robot tasks to documented SOPs and work instructions.

**Process tracking** - Monitor which procedures each robot runs and when.

**Audit trails** - Keep compliance records connecting robot actions to quality requirements.

**Fleet visibility** - A dashboard showing all robots and their current process status.

**Knowledge base** - Central repository for procedures, accessible across all robots.

### Integration requirements

- KUKA robots with KRC2, KRC4, or KRC5 controllers
- Ethernet network connectivity
- OPC UA or KUKA.Connect for data exchange
- Middleware to translate between KUKA protocols and the Tallyfy API
- Tallyfy organization with API access enabled

## Implementation considerations

### Assessment phase

Before you start:

1. Document current KRL programs and their associated procedures
2. Identify which processes need audit trails or compliance tracking
3. Check your network infrastructure for robot connectivity
4. Map integration points between KUKA controllers and external systems

### Integration options

**Read-only monitoring** - Track robot status and link to Tallyfy processes without modifying robot programs. Lowest complexity.

**Bidirectional integration** - The robot reports completion status while Tallyfy provides procedure parameters. Requires middleware development.

**Full workflow control** - Tallyfy initiates robot programs based on process triggers. Most complex - needs extensive testing.
