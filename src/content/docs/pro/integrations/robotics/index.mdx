## Physical robotics integration with Tallyfy

Tallyfy bridges the gap between physical robots and workflow management. Robots can query process documentation, mark tasks complete, and enable real-time visibility into automated operations - creating seamless human-robot collaboration.

Robot: Industrial Robot
Protocol: Protocol Layer {
  style.fill: "#f2faf4"
}
Tallyfy: Tallyfy API {
  style.fill: "#e1f7e6"
}
Dashboard: Real-time Dashboard

Documentation: Process Documentation {
  style.fill: "#f2faf4"
}
Tasks: Task Management {
  style.fill: "#e1f7e6"
}
Events: Event Stream

Robot -> Protocol: OPC UA/ROS/MQTT
Protocol -> Tallyfy: REST API calls

Documentation -> Robot: Query instructions
Robot -> Tasks: Mark complete
Tasks -> Events: Status updates
Events -> Dashboard: Live tracking
```

**What to notice:**
- Robots communicate through standard industrial protocols (OPC UA, ROS, MQTT)
- Tallyfy provides queryable documentation that robots can follow
- Task completion happens automatically as robots perform work

## How robots interact with Tallyfy

Industrial robots and collaborative robots (cobots) connect to Tallyfy through middleware that translates between industrial protocols and REST APIs. Here's the typical flow:

1. **Robot queries documentation** - Before starting work, the robot requests its current task instructions from Tallyfy using `GET /api/v1/tasks/{id}`
2. **Process execution** - The robot performs physical operations following the retrieved instructions
3. **Status reporting** - As work progresses, the robot sends updates: `PATCH /api/v1/tasks/{id}/complete`
4. **Exception handling** - If issues arise, robots can pause tasks or request human intervention

The magic happens through protocol translation. Your robot speaks OPC UA or ROS, while Tallyfy speaks REST. A lightweight middleware service (often running on an edge server near the robot) handles this translation.

## Supported robot communication protocols

### OPC UA (Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture)
Most industrial robots from ABB, KUKA, FANUC, and Siemens support OPC UA. This protocol provides secure, reliable communication with built-in data modeling. Connect through standard OPC UA clients that translate robot states to Tallyfy API calls.

### ROS/ROS2 (Robot Operating System)
Open-source robotics middleware used by research institutions and modern collaborative robots. ROS nodes can directly call Tallyfy's REST API using standard HTTP libraries. The ROS2 DDS layer ensures reliable message delivery even in unstable network conditions.

### MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)
Lightweight protocol perfect for IoT-enabled robots and cobots. MQTT brokers can forward robot telemetry to Tallyfy webhooks, enabling event-driven task updates. Popular with Universal Robots and smaller collaborative systems.

### Custom protocols via edge computing
Legacy robots using proprietary protocols connect through edge computing devices (like industrial PCs or gateways) that translate between the robot's native language and Tallyfy's API.

## Implementation architecture

### Basic integration setup
```json
{
  "robot_id": "UR10e_Cell_4",
  "tallyfy_config": {
    "api_endpoint": "https://api.tallyfy.com/v1",
    "auth_token": "Bearer {token}",
    "process_id": "warehouse_picking_abc123",
    "webhook_url": "https://factory.example.com/robot-events"
  },
  "protocol_config": {
    "type": "opcua",
    "server": "opc.tcp://192.168.1.10:4840",
    "update_interval_ms": 1000
  }
}
```

### Task documentation structure for robots
Tallyfy stores structured instructions that robots can parse and execute. Each task includes:

- **Operation parameters** - Speed, force, positions, tolerances
- **Safety boundaries** - Keep-out zones, speed limits near humans
- **Quality checks** - Measurement points, acceptance criteria
- **Error recovery** - What to do when things go wrong
- **Handoff points** - When to involve human operators

### Real-time progress tracking
As robots work, they continuously update task status:

1. **Task started** - Robot begins operation, marks task "in_progress"
2. **Milestone updates** - Reports completion percentages (25%, 50%, 75%)
3. **Quality data** - Sends measurement results, vision inspection outcomes
4. **Task completion** - Marks done with final quality metrics
5. **Exception reporting** - Flags issues requiring human intervention

This creates complete visibility into robotic operations. Plant managers see exactly which robots are working on what, current progress, and any bottlenecks - all through Tallyfy's dashboard.

## Human-robot collaboration workflows

Modern manufacturing increasingly relies on humans and robots working together. Tallyfy orchestrates these collaborative workflows by managing handoffs and ensuring safety compliance.

### Typical collaborative scenarios

**Assembly operations**: Robot performs heavy lifting and precise positioning while human handles delicate components. Tallyfy tracks which tasks are robot-assigned versus human-assigned, ensuring smooth transitions.

**Quality inspection**: Robot performs initial measurements, flags anomalies for human review. Human inspectors receive notifications in Tallyfy when their expertise is needed.

**Maintenance workflows**: Robots run diagnostic routines and report issues. Maintenance technicians get assigned tasks with detailed robot-generated diagnostic data.

### Safety compliance and ISO standards

Integration follows ISO 10218-1:2025 requirements for collaborative applications. Tallyfy maintains audit trails showing:

- Who (human or robot) performed each task
- Safety validations completed before robot operations
- Speed and force limiting compliance during collaboration
- Emergency stop events and recovery procedures
- Cybersecurity measures protecting robot control systems

## Setting up robot integration

### Prerequisites
- Tallyfy organization with API access enabled
- Robot controller with network connectivity
- Edge server or industrial PC for protocol translation
- IT/OT network bridge configured for secure communication

### Step-by-step implementation

1. **Generate API credentials** in Tallyfy organization settings
2. **Install middleware** on edge server (options include Node-RED, Kepware, or custom service)
3. **Configure robot communication** - Set up OPC UA server or ROS nodes on robot controller
4. **Map robot operations to tasks** - Define which robot programs correspond to Tallyfy tasks
5. **Test in simulation** - Verify API calls work correctly before live deployment
6. **Deploy with safety validation** - Ensure all safety systems active during integration testing
7. **Monitor and optimize** - Use Tallyfy analytics to identify bottlenecks and optimize cycle times

## Advanced automation patterns

### Event-driven robot triggering
```javascript
// Webhook receiver for robot activation
app.post('/webhook/tallyfy', async (req, res) => {
  const { task_id, action, metadata } = req.body;
  
  if (action === 'task_ready' && metadata.robot_capable) {
    // Trigger robot program
    await robotController.startProgram({
      program: metadata.robot_program,
      parameters: metadata.operation_params,
      task_id: task_id
    });
  }
  
  res.status(200).send('Robot triggered');
});
```

### Multi-robot coordination
When multiple robots work on the same process, Tallyfy manages dependencies and prevents conflicts. Robot A completes welding, triggering Robot B to start painting - all coordinated through task dependencies in Tallyfy.

### Predictive maintenance integration
Robots report operational metrics (cycle counts, motor temperatures, vibration levels) as task metadata. Tallyfy's automation rules trigger maintenance tasks when thresholds are exceeded, preventing unexpected downtime.

## Industry applications

## Benefits of robot-Tallyfy integration

**Complete process visibility** - See exactly what robots and humans are doing in real-time. No more walking the floor to check robot status.

**Automatic documentation** - Every robot action is logged with timestamps, creating comprehensive audit trails for compliance and continuous improvement.

**Flexible work allocation** - Dynamically assign tasks to robots or humans based on availability, capabilities, and current workload.

**Rapid exception handling** - When robots encounter issues, the right human expert gets notified immediately with all diagnostic data.

**Performance analytics** - Compare cycle times between robots, identify bottlenecks, and optimize workflows using actual production data.

**Seamless scaling** - Add new robots or production cells without disrupting existing workflows. Just configure the new robot to query Tallyfy for its tasks.

## Security considerations

### Network segregation
Keep robot control networks (OT) separated from business networks (IT) using DMZ architecture. Tallyfy API calls happen through secured gateways, never direct robot-to-internet connections.

### Authentication and authorization
Use separate API credentials for each robot or production cell. Implement role-based access control limiting robots to specific processes and tasks. Rotate tokens regularly and monitor for unusual activity patterns.

### Data encryption
All communication between robots and Tallyfy uses TLS encryption. Store sensitive operation parameters and quality data using field-level encryption in Tallyfy.

### Fail-safe mechanisms
Robots must maintain local operation capability if Tallyfy connection is lost. Implement store-and-forward patterns to sync data once connectivity restores. Never make safety systems dependent on cloud connectivity.
