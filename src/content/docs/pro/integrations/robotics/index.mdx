## Robotics workflow challenges

Coordinating robot systems with human teams is hard. Industrial and commercial robots run on proprietary control systems and communication protocols - connecting them to business workflows requires middleware, protocol translation, and careful architecture planning.

## Common communication protocols

### OPC UA (Open Platform Communications Unified Architecture)
Industry standard used by major manufacturers (ABB, KUKA, FANUC, Siemens). It provides secure machine-to-machine communication with built-in data modeling.

### ROS/ROS2 (Robot Operating System)
Open-source robotics middleware common in research and collaborative robots. ROS2 uses DDS (Data Distribution Service) for real-time communication between nodes.

### MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)
Lightweight publish-subscribe protocol built for IoT devices. Used for robot telemetry and event-driven communication, with lower bandwidth needs than OPC UA.

### Proprietary protocols
Many manufacturers use proprietary communication methods that need vendor-specific SDKs or edge devices to translate into standard protocols.

## Integration architecture

### Network topology
Robot systems typically need network segregation between operational technology (OT) and information technology (IT) networks. Integration points usually happen through:

- DMZ (demilitarized zone) with controlled access
- Edge computing devices bridging OT and IT networks
- API gateways with rate limiting and authentication
- Message queues for asynchronous communication

### Security requirements
When connecting robots to external systems, you'll need:

- Network isolation between robot control and business networks
- Authentication and authorization for all API calls
- TLS encryption for data in transit
- Fail-safe mechanisms if connectivity drops
- Air-gapped operation for safety-critical systems

## Human-robot collaboration workflows

Modern industrial settings increasingly mix automated and manual work. Coordinating these workflows means connecting robot control systems with human task management.

### Common patterns

**Assembly operations** - Robots handle heavy lifting and precise positioning while humans manage delicate components that need dexterity.

**Quality inspection** - Automated measurement systems run initial checks, routing exceptions to human inspectors.

**Maintenance workflows** - Diagnostic routines generate data that maintenance teams use for troubleshooting and repair.

### Safety and compliance

Industrial robot deployments must follow relevant safety standards:

- ISO 10218 (Safety requirements for industrial robots)
- ISO/TS 15066 (Collaborative robots)
- ANSI/RIA R15.06 (North American industrial robot safety)

Audit trails help demonstrate compliance during safety assessments.

## Planning your integration

### Technical requirements
- API access and authentication
- Network connectivity and bandwidth
- Protocol translation capabilities
- Edge computing or middleware needs
- Data sync and latency requirements

### Organizational readiness
- IT and operations team collaboration
- Clear ownership of robot systems
- Change management processes
- Training for maintenance staff
- Incident response procedures

## Industry applications

### Manufacturing
Automotive assembly, electronics production, material handling, CNC coordination, quality inspection systems

### Logistics and warehousing
Autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), automated guided vehicles (AGVs), picking and packing systems, inventory management

### Healthcare
Laboratory automation, pharmacy dispensing, sample tracking, diagnostic equipment coordination

### Food and beverage
Packaging lines, batch processing, cleanroom operations, quality control systems

## Common challenges

**Protocol complexity** - Translating between industrial protocols and business systems needs specialized middleware and expertise.

**Network security** - Keeping proper OT/IT segregation while enabling data flow.

**Latency sensitivity** - Real-time robot control and asynchronous workflow updates need different architectural approaches.

**Legacy systems** - Older robot controllers may lack modern connectivity options.

**Vendor lock-in** - Proprietary systems can limit integration flexibility.

### Documentation and knowledge management

Organizations managing robot fleets often struggle with:

- Keeping operational procedures up to date
- Sharing improvements across multiple robot installations
- Tracking which procedures were followed for compliance
- Managing procedure versions as operations evolve
- Coordinating human and automated tasks
