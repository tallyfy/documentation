## What this integration does

Microsoft 365 Copilot can connect to Tallyfy through API plugins and enterprise OAuth2. This brings your Microsoft tools - emails, documents, Teams conversations, SharePoint data - into workflow automation while respecting your organization's security policies.

### How it works

The integration uses Microsoft's API plugin framework with enterprise authentication:

1. **API plugin deployment** - Install the Tallyfy plugin in your Microsoft 365 admin center
2. **Azure AD authentication** - Single sign-on through your existing Microsoft identity
3. **Graph API access** - Copilot reads your Microsoft 365 data with scoped permissions
4. **Declarative agents** - Configure Copilot agents for specific workflow scenarios

Copilot already knows your organization's context - who works on what, document history, communication patterns - which makes it well-suited for enterprise workflows.

### Authentication and security

Microsoft Copilot uses Azure AD OAuth2:

**Authorization endpoint**: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/authorize`
**Token endpoint**: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/token`

Enterprise security features apply automatically:
- Conditional access policies
- Multi-factor authentication
- Sensitivity labels
- Data loss prevention rules
- Compliance boundaries

### Using Microsoft 365 context

#### Email-driven automation
Copilot can read Outlook emails to trigger workflows:
```
Scenario: Contract Request Email
Copilot action: Detects contract request email, extracts requirements,
creates Tallyfy process with pre-filled data, assigns to legal team,
attaches relevant email thread.
```

#### Document intelligence
Copilot can analyze SharePoint and OneDrive files:
```
Scenario: Policy Update Process
Copilot action: Compares new policy version with previous, identifies
changes, determines affected departments, generates summary for
approval, creates review tasks for stakeholders.
```

#### Teams collaboration
Copilot bridges Teams and Tallyfy:
```
Scenario: Project Kickoff
Copilot action: Reads Teams meeting transcript, extracts action items,
creates Tallyfy process with assigned tasks, sets deadlines from
mentioned dates, links to Teams channel.
```

### Declarative agent configuration

You can create specialized Copilot agents for your workflows:

**Sales process agent**
```yaml
name: Sales Workflow Assistant
instructions: |
  Monitor sales emails for new opportunities.
  Create opportunity processes in Tallyfy.
  Pull customer data from Dynamics 365.
  Generate proposals using SharePoint templates.
knowledge:
  - SharePoint: /sites/Sales/Templates
  - Teams: Sales Team Channel
actions:
  - Create Tallyfy process
  - Assign tasks by territory
  - Generate documents
```

**HR operations agent**
```yaml
name: HR Process Manager
instructions: |
  Process employee requests from Forms.
  Check policy documents for guidance.
  Route approvals based on org chart.
  Maintain compliance audit trail.
knowledge:
  - SharePoint: /sites/HR/Policies
  - Teams: HR Support Channel
actions:
  - Create employee processes
  - Route hierarchical approvals
  - Generate HR documents
```

### Microsoft Graph API integration

Copilot accesses your organization's data through Graph API:

**Available data sources**:
- User profiles and org hierarchy
- Calendar availability and meeting details
- Email content and attachments
- SharePoint documents and lists
- Teams messages and files
- OneDrive files
- Planner tasks

**Example API calls**:
```javascript
// Get manager for approval routing
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/{id}/manager

// Create Teams meeting for process review
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me/onlineMeetings

// Access SharePoint template
GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/sites/{site}/drive/items/{id}
```

### Power Platform connectivity

You can extend Copilot with Power Platform:

- **Power Automate** - Trigger multi-system workflows, connect to 1000+ services, handle approvals
- **Power Apps** - Embed custom forms in tasks, create mobile interfaces, access on-premises data
- **Power BI** - Generate workflow analytics, create dashboards, track KPIs

### Compliance and governance

**Information protection**:
- Sensitivity labels apply to generated content
- Encryption for data at rest and in transit
- Rights management for documents

**Audit and monitoring**:
- All Copilot actions logged in audit trail
- Compliance center visibility
- Alert policies for unusual activity
- eDiscovery support

**Data residency**:
- Respects geographic boundaries
- Complies with regional regulations
- Supports government clouds

### Performance tips

- Cache frequently accessed data to reduce API calls
- Batch Graph API requests where possible
- Use delta queries for change detection
- Implement webhook subscriptions for real-time updates
- Respect Graph API throttling limits with exponential backoff

### Troubleshooting

**"Copilot can't access Tallyfy"**
- Verify API plugin installation in admin center
- Check Azure AD app permissions
- Review conditional access policies
- Ensure the user has a Copilot license

**"Data isn't syncing correctly"**
- Check Graph API permissions
- Verify sensitivity labels allow access
- Review data loss prevention rules

### Licensing requirements

- Microsoft 365 E3 or E5
- Copilot for Microsoft 365 (check Microsoft for current pricing)
- Tallyfy subscription
- Optional: Power Platform licenses

### Getting started

1. **Admin setup** - Install Tallyfy API plugin from Microsoft admin center
2. **Configure permissions** - Grant necessary Graph API and Tallyfy permissions
3. **Create agent** - Build a declarative agent for your use case
4. **Test integration** - Run a pilot with a single workflow
5. **Roll out** - Deploy to all users with training
