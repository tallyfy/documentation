## Integrating Microsoft 365 Copilot with Tallyfy workflows

Your Microsoft 365 Copilot subscription becomes a workflow automation powerhouse when connected to Tallyfy. Through API plugins and enterprise OAuth2, Copilot brings the full context of your Microsoft ecosystem - emails, documents, Teams conversations, SharePoint data - directly into workflow automation while maintaining your organization's security policies.

### How Microsoft Copilot integration works

Copilot integration uses Microsoft's API plugin framework with enterprise authentication:

1. **API plugin deployment**: Install the Tallyfy plugin in your Microsoft 365 admin center
2. **Azure AD authentication**: Single sign-on through your existing Microsoft identity
3. **Graph API access**: Copilot accesses your Microsoft 365 data with permissions
4. **Declarative agents**: Configure Copilot agents for specific workflow scenarios
5. **Compliance maintained**: All actions respect your organization's policies

Unlike standalone AI, Copilot knows your organization's context - who works on what, document history, communication patterns - making it uniquely powerful for enterprise workflows.

### Authentication and security

Microsoft Copilot uses enterprise-grade Azure AD OAuth2:

**Authorization endpoint**: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/authorize`
**Token endpoint**: `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenant}/oauth2/v2.0/token`
**Required permissions**:
- `Tasks.ReadWrite`
- `Workflows.ReadWrite`
- `Files.Read`
- `User.Read`

Enterprise features:
- Conditional access policies apply
- Multi-factor authentication enforced
- Sensitivity labels respected
- Data loss prevention active
- Compliance boundaries maintained

### Leveraging Microsoft 365 context

#### Email-driven automation
Copilot reads Outlook emails to trigger workflows:
```
Scenario: Contract Request Email
Copilot action: Detects contract request email, extracts requirements,
creates Tallyfy process with pre-filled data, assigns to legal team,
attaches relevant email thread.
```

#### Document intelligence
Copilot analyzes SharePoint and OneDrive files:
```
Scenario: Policy Update Process
Copilot action: Compares new policy version with previous, identifies
all changes, determines affected departments, generates summary for
approval, creates review tasks for stakeholders.
```

#### Teams collaboration
Copilot bridges Teams and Tallyfy:
```
Scenario: Project Kickoff
Copilot action: Reads Teams meeting transcript, extracts action items,
creates Tallyfy process with tasks assigned based on discussion,
sets deadlines from mentioned dates, links to Teams channel.
```

### Real-world enterprise examples

**Employee onboarding automation**
```
Workflow: New Hire Process
Copilot role: Reads offer letter from email, creates AD account through
Graph API, assigns Microsoft 365 licenses, generates equipment request,
schedules Teams meetings with manager, creates training task list based
on role.
```

**Compliance review process**
```
Workflow: Quarterly Compliance Check
Copilot role: Scans all SharePoint documents for compliance markers,
identifies documents needing review, checks against regulatory changes,
generates audit report, assigns review tasks to document owners.
```

**Customer proposal generation**
```
Workflow: RFP Response
Copilot role: Searches previous proposals in SharePoint, finds relevant
sections, adapts content to new requirements, maintains brand consistency,
pulls latest pricing from Excel, assembles complete proposal.
```

### Declarative agent configuration
