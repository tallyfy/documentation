## Connecting ChatGPT to Tallyfy

Connect your ChatGPT subscription to Tallyfy through the MCP server at `https://mcp.tallyfy.com`. Once set up, you can search, read, and manage tasks, processes, and templates using plain language - no API keys or code required.

The connection uses OAuth 2.1 with PKCE. ChatGPT handles the auth flow automatically - you just sign in with your Tallyfy credentials and authorize access.

<Steps>

1. **Enable Developer Mode in ChatGPT**

   Click your profile icon in the top-left corner, then go to **Settings** > **Apps and Connectors** > **Advanced Settings**. Turn on **Developer Mode** (required for write access to MCP tools - read-only Deep Research works without it).

2. **Open the Connectors or Apps section**

   In ChatGPT Settings, go to **Connectors** (or **Apps** - OpenAI renamed this in December 2025, so the label depends on your version). Click **Create** or **Add Custom App**.

3. **Configure the connector**

   Fill in these details:
   - **Name**: Tallyfy
   - **Description**: Connect to Tallyfy to search and manage workflow tasks, processes, and templates
   - **MCP Server URL**: `https://mcp.tallyfy.com`
   - **Authentication**: OAuth 2.1 with PKCE (ChatGPT auto-discovers the endpoints)

4. **Authorize with your Tallyfy account**

   Click **Connect**. ChatGPT queries `https://mcp.tallyfy.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` to discover the OAuth endpoints, then redirects you to Tallyfy's login page. Sign in and click **Authorize** to grant access. OpenAI stores your refresh tokens securely.

5. **Test the connection**

   Start a new conversation and try:

   ```text
   Show me my open tasks in Tallyfy
   ```

   If you see a tool call step in the response followed by your task list, the connection is working.

6. **Share with your team (optional)**

   Publish the connector to your ChatGPT workspace for team-wide access. Admins control visibility and permissions in workspace settings.

</Steps>

### OAuth endpoints reference

ChatGPT auto-discovers these through `/.well-known` endpoints - no manual configuration needed. For debugging or custom client setup:

| Endpoint | URL |
|---|---|
| MCP server | `https://mcp.tallyfy.com` |
| Protected resource metadata (RFC 9728) | `https://mcp.tallyfy.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` |
| Authorization server metadata (RFC 8414) | `https://mcp.tallyfy.com/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` |
| Authorization (proxy) | `https://mcp.tallyfy.com/mcp/oauth/authorize` |
| Token exchange (proxy) | `https://mcp.tallyfy.com/mcp/oauth/token` |
| Client registration (proxy) | `https://mcp.tallyfy.com/mcp/oauth/register` |
| Tallyfy auth server | `https://account.tallyfy.com` |

**Supported OAuth scopes** (ChatGPT requests all of these during authorization):

### Write operation security

ChatGPT shows **confirmation modals** before any write operation (create, update, delete). You always approve changes before they happen.

## Real-world usage examples

**Finding urgent tasks**
```text
You: "Show me all urgent tasks assigned to the sales team"
ChatGPT: Calls search_for_tasks, returns filtered task list with details
```

**Checking process status**
```text
You: "What's the status of the employee onboarding process for John Smith?"
ChatGPT: Calls search_for_processes, returns process details, completion %, current step
```

**Template health audit**
```text
You: "Analyze our Customer Onboarding template and suggest improvements"
ChatGPT: Chains get_template > assess_template_health > analyze_template_automations >
         suggest_automation_consolidation, then summarizes findings
```

**Bulk task review**
```text
You: "Get all my tasks and summarize which ones are overdue"
ChatGPT: Calls get_my_tasks, analyzes due dates, provides organized summary
```

**Creating automation rules**
```text
You: "Add a rule to the Sales Template that assigns the contract review step
     to Sarah when deal value exceeds $50,000"
ChatGPT: Calls get_template to find the step ID, then create_automation_rule,
         confirms creation after your approval
```

**Cross-referencing data**
```text
You: "Find the onboarding template, get all its form fields, then show me
     active onboarding processes and highlight which fields are most
     commonly left empty"

ChatGPT chains:
1. get_all_templates to find the onboarding template
2. get_template to retrieve form field details
3. search_for_processes to find active runs
4. Analyzes and summarizes completion patterns
```

## Tips for better queries

**Be specific with search terms**
```text
Good: "Find all tasks with 'invoice approval' in the title assigned to me"
Vague: "Show tasks"
```

**Provide context for filtering**
```text
Good: "Get processes from the Customer Onboarding template created in the last 7 days"
Vague: "Find recent processes"
```

**Specify what you want to modify**
```text
Good: "Update the 'Priority' dropdown in the Bug Report template to add 'Critical' as an option"
Vague: "Change the priority field"
```

**Ask for structured summaries**
```text
Good: "List all my tasks grouped by due date, showing only title and assignee"
Vague: "What are my tasks?"
```

## Limitations of the text interface

ChatGPT's text-based UI can't handle everything in Tallyfy:

### Visual workflow representation

ChatGPT can't display Tallyfy's visual process tracker or workflow diagrams. You won't see step flows, progress bars, or process dependencies at a glance. For visual monitoring, use Tallyfy's [tracker view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/) directly.

### Complex form interactions

Dropdown fields with many options, date pickers, and file uploads don't translate well to plain text. File attachments can't be handled at all.

### Real-time updates

ChatGPT doesn't push live updates. Changes made by teammates in Tallyfy won't appear until you ask again - no live notifications.

### Bulk visual operations

Drag-and-drop step reordering, batch update previews, and visual branching structures stay in Tallyfy's native interface.

## Security and data handling

- **OAuth 2.1 with PKCE** - token-based access with no API keys passed around
- **Granular scopes** - 12 separate read/write scopes let you control exactly what ChatGPT can access
- **Write confirmations** - ChatGPT shows modals before any create, update, or delete operation
- **Token storage** - refresh tokens stored securely by OpenAI, revocable anytime from ChatGPT Settings > Connectors
- **No training on your data** - OpenAI doesn't use API interactions for model training (per their usage policies)
- **Prompt injection risk** - be cautious if your task or template content contains prompt-like instructions and verify unexpected ChatGPT behaviors before acting on them

## Troubleshooting

**"ChatGPT can't find the Tallyfy connector"**
- Verify Developer Mode is enabled: ChatGPT **Settings** > **Apps and Connectors** > **Advanced Settings**
- Confirm your ChatGPT plan supports Apps/Connectors (Plus, Pro, Team, Enterprise, Education)
- Re-create the connector with the correct URL: `https://mcp.tallyfy.com`

**"Authentication fails or keeps looping"**
- Re-authorize from ChatGPT **Settings** > **Connectors** > **Tallyfy** > **Reconnect**
- Confirm your Tallyfy account is active with at least a Standard user role
- Open `https://mcp.tallyfy.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` in a browser - a JSON response confirms the server is reachable
- Clear browser cache and retry

**"ChatGPT says it can't access certain tools"**
- Verify you approved all OAuth scopes during initial connection
- Some write operations require an Administrator role in Tallyfy
- Try disconnecting and reconnecting to re-request all scopes

**"Search results are empty or incomplete"**
- Make queries more specific - `search_for_tasks` requires a non-empty keyword
- Verify the items exist in your Tallyfy workspace and that your user has permission to view them

**"SSE connection errors"**
- SSE transport is no longer supported - the Tallyfy MCP server uses Streamable HTTP only
- Update to the latest ChatGPT version, which defaults to Streamable HTTP

## Cost considerations

**ChatGPT subscription**:
- ChatGPT Plus: $20/month - MCP via Developer Mode, individual use
- ChatGPT Pro: $200/month - higher rate limits, priority access
- ChatGPT Team: $25/user/month - workspace sharing, admin controls
- ChatGPT Enterprise/Education: custom pricing - admin-managed Apps, enhanced security

Tallyfy doesn't charge extra for MCP usage, but all MCP tool calls count toward your Tallyfy API rate limits. Use specific queries to minimize unnecessary tool calls.
