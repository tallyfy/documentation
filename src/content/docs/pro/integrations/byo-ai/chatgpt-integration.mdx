## Connecting ChatGPT to automate Tallyfy tasks

Your ChatGPT Plus or Team subscription can become a workflow automation engine inside Tallyfy. Through GPT Actions and OAuth2 authentication, ChatGPT reads your task data, processes it according to your instructions, and completes work automatically - all using the subscription you already pay for.

### How ChatGPT integration works

The integration uses OpenAI's GPT Actions framework (formerly Custom GPTs) to create a secure bridge between your ChatGPT account and Tallyfy workflows:

1. **Custom GPT configuration**: We provide a Tallyfy GPT with pre-configured actions
2. **OAuth2 authentication**: You authorize the GPT to access your Tallyfy workspace
3. **Task context sharing**: When triggered, Tallyfy sends task data to your GPT
4. **Intelligent processing**: ChatGPT processes based on your custom instructions
5. **Automatic updates**: Responses flow back to complete tasks or add comments

No API keys to manage. No code to write. Just connect and automate.

### Authentication setup

ChatGPT uses OAuth 2.1 with PKCE for secure authentication:

**MCP Server**: `https://mcp.tallyfy.com`
**Authorization endpoint**: `https://go.tallyfy.com/mcp/oauth/authorize`
**Token endpoint**: `https://go.tallyfy.com/mcp/oauth/token`
**DCR endpoint**: `https://go.tallyfy.com/mcp/oauth/register`
**Scopes supported**: `mcp:tasks`, `mcp:processes`, `mcp:templates`, `mcp:users`

When you first connect, ChatGPT will:
1. Redirect you to Tallyfy's login page
2. Ask you to approve permissions
3. Store refresh tokens for persistent access
4. Maintain the connection until you revoke it

### Task automation capabilities

#### Reading task context
ChatGPT receives:
- Task title and description
- All form field values from previous steps
- File attachments (as text extraction)
- Process history and comments
- Assignment and deadline information

#### Processing with custom instructions
You embed instructions directly in your Tallyfy templates:
```
When this task is assigned, analyze the customer complaint in the
'complaint_details' field and:
1. Categorize the issue (product, service, billing)
2. Assess severity (low, medium, high, critical)
3. Generate a professional response
4. Suggest resolution steps
```

#### Taking actions
ChatGPT can:
- Complete tasks with specific outcomes
- Fill form fields with generated content
- Add detailed comments with analysis
- Trigger conditional workflow branches
- Create follow-up tasks

### Real-world examples

**Contract review automation**
```
Task: Review Sales Contract
ChatGPT instruction: "Extract key terms (price, duration, deliverables),
identify any non-standard clauses, assess risk level, and provide a
summary recommendation in the 'review_notes' field."
```

**Customer response drafting**
```
Task: Respond to Support Ticket
ChatGPT instruction: "Read the customer issue, check our knowledge base
context, draft a helpful response addressing their specific concerns,
and mark task complete if issue is resolved."
```

**Data analysis and reporting**
```
Task: Analyze Monthly Metrics
ChatGPT instruction: "Process the attached CSV file, calculate month-over-month
growth, identify trends, generate executive summary, and populate the
'insights' field with key findings."
```

### Custom instructions best practices

**Be specific about data sources**
```
Good: "Use the value from the 'customer_name' field"
Bad: "Use the customer name"
```

**Define clear output formats**
```
Good: "Generate a bullet-point list with 3-5 items"
Bad: "Provide some bullet points"
```

**Include validation rules**
```
Good: "If the 'amount' field exceeds $10,000, flag for manager review"
Bad: "Check if the amount is high"
```

**Specify tone and style**
```
Good: "Write in professional but friendly tone, maximum 150 words"
Bad: "Write professionally"
```

### Handling sensitive data

ChatGPT integration includes built-in safeguards:

- **Data minimization**: Only send necessary fields to ChatGPT
- **No training on your data**: OpenAI doesn't use API data for model training
- **Audit logging**: Every interaction is logged in Tallyfy
- **Configurable restrictions**: Block certain data types from AI processing
- **Regional compliance**: Respect data residency requirements

### Rate limits and performance

**OpenAI quotas apply**:
- ChatGPT Plus: Standard message limits per time period
- ChatGPT Team: Higher limits based on team size
- ChatGPT Enterprise: Custom limits based on agreement

**Optimization strategies**:
- Batch similar tasks together
- Cache common responses
- Use conditional logic to skip AI when unnecessary
- Implement fallback to manual processing

### Troubleshooting common issues

**"ChatGPT is not responding to tasks"**
- Verify OAuth connection is still active
- Check if you've hit OpenAI rate limits
- Ensure task has all required fields populated

**"Responses are generic or unhelpful"**
- Make instructions more specific
- Include example outputs
- Provide more context in task data

**"Authentication keeps expiring"**
- Re-authorize the OAuth connection
- Check if your ChatGPT subscription is active
- Verify Tallyfy API permissions haven't changed

### Advanced patterns

**Multi-step reasoning**
```
Instruction: "First analyze the problem, then generate three possible
solutions with pros/cons, finally recommend the best option with
justification."
```

**Conditional processing**
```
Instruction: "If customer sentiment is negative, generate an apology
and escalation path. If positive, generate a thank you message and
upsell opportunity."
```

**Data validation**
```
Instruction: "Verify all required fields are logically consistent.
If 'end_date' is before 'start_date', flag error and don't complete task."
```

### Getting started checklist

1. **Verify subscription**: Ensure you have ChatGPT Plus or higher
2. **Install Tallyfy GPT**: Available in OpenAI's GPT Store (coming soon)
3. **Configure OAuth**: Authorize connection to your Tallyfy workspace
4. **Test with simple task**: Create a basic automation to verify setup
5. **Add to templates**: Embed AI instructions in your workflow templates
6. **Monitor and refine**: Review AI performance and adjust instructions

### Cost optimization

Since you're using your existing ChatGPT subscription:
- No additional AI costs beyond your OpenAI subscription
- Tallyfy API calls count toward your plan limits
- Optimize prompts to reduce token usage
- Use ChatGPT Team for better rate limits across users

Your ChatGPT subscription finally becomes a productivity multiplier, not just a chat window. Every task it completes saves your team time for work that actually needs human intelligence.
