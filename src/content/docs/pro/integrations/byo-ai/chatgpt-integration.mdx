## Connecting ChatGPT to automate Tallyfy tasks

Your ChatGPT Plus or Pro subscription can become a workflow automation engine for Tallyfy. Through MCP (Model Context Protocol) and OAuth 2.1 authentication, ChatGPT connects to your Tallyfy workspace to search, read, and manage tasks, processes, and templates using natural language - all through the subscription you already pay for.

### How ChatGPT integration works

The integration uses OpenAI's Connectors platform with MCP (Model Context Protocol) to create a secure bridge between ChatGPT and your Tallyfy workspace:

1. **MCP server connection**: ChatGPT connects to Tallyfy's MCP server at `mcp.tallyfy.com`
2. **OAuth 2.1 authentication**: You authorize ChatGPT to access your Tallyfy workspace through a secure OAuth flow
3. **Natural language queries**: Ask ChatGPT to search tasks, check process status, or retrieve template information
4. **Tool execution**: ChatGPT uses MCP tools to read and write data in your Tallyfy workspace
5. **Intelligent responses**: ChatGPT processes your requests and returns structured information or confirms actions

No API keys to manage. No code to write. Just enable Developer Mode, connect the MCP server, and start automating.

### Write operation security

ChatGPT displays **explicit confirmation modals** before executing any write or modify operations (create, update, delete). This prevents accidental changes and gives you full control over what the AI can modify in your Tallyfy workspace.

### Real-world usage examples

**Finding urgent tasks**
```
You: "Show me all urgent tasks assigned to the sales team"
ChatGPT: Uses search_for_tasks tool → Returns filtered task list with details
```

**Checking process status**
```
You: "What's the status of the employee onboarding process for John Smith?"
ChatGPT: Uses search_for_processes tool → Returns process details, completion percentage, current step
```

**Template discovery**
```
You: "Find all templates related to customer support workflows"
ChatGPT: Uses search_for_templates tool → Lists matching templates with descriptions
```

**Bulk task review**
```
You: "Get all my tasks and summarize which ones are overdue"
ChatGPT: Uses get_my_tasks tool → Analyzes due dates and provides organized summary
```

**Creating automation rules**
```
You: "Add a rule to the Sales Template that sends an email notification when the 'contract_value' field exceeds $50,000"
ChatGPT: Uses create_automation_rule tool → Confirms creation after your approval
```

**Template configuration**
```
You: "Show me all the form fields in the Customer Onboarding template"
ChatGPT: Uses get_template tool → Lists all form fields with their types and properties
```

### Best practices for natural language queries

**Be specific with search terms**
```
Good: "Find all tasks with 'invoice approval' in the title assigned to me"
Bad: "Show tasks"
```

**Provide context for filtering**
```
Good: "Get processes created in the last 7 days with 'onboarding' in the name"
Bad: "Find recent processes"
```

**Specify exactly what you want to modify**
```
Good: "Update the 'Priority' dropdown field in the Bug Report template to include 'Critical' as an option"
Bad: "Change the priority field"
```

**Ask for structured summaries**
```
Good: "List all my tasks grouped by due date, show only title and assignee"
Bad: "What are my tasks?"
```

### Security and data handling

**Built-in safeguards**:
- **OAuth 2.1 authentication**: Secure token-based access with PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)
- **Granular scoped permissions**: 12 separate read/write scopes for users, tasks, processes, templates, forms, and automations
- **Write confirmations**: ChatGPT displays explicit modals before any create, update, or delete operations
- **Token management**: Refresh tokens stored securely by OpenAI, revocable from ChatGPT settings
- **Audit logging**: All MCP tool executions are logged in Tallyfy for compliance tracking
- **No training on your data**: OpenAI doesn't use API interactions for model training (per OpenAI Enterprise Agreement)

**Important security notes**:
- Only connect MCP servers you trust - prompt injection attacks are possible
- Review all write operations before confirming them in ChatGPT
- Regularly audit which Connectors have access to your Tallyfy workspace
- Revoke access immediately if you suspect unauthorized use

### Rate limits and performance

**OpenAI limits apply**:
- ChatGPT Plus: Standard message limits per 3-hour window
- ChatGPT Pro: Higher limits with priority access

**Tallyfy API limits**:
- All MCP tool calls count toward your Tallyfy API rate limits
- Standard rate limiting applies per organization

**Performance tips**:
- Be specific in queries to reduce unnecessary tool calls
- Use search tools to filter before requesting full details
- Batch related questions in a single conversation
- ChatGPT caches tool results within the same conversation

### Troubleshooting common issues

**"ChatGPT says it can't find the Tallyfy connector"**
- Verify Developer Mode is enabled in ChatGPT settings
- Check that you have ChatGPT Plus or Pro subscription (not Team/Enterprise yet)
- Re-create the Connector with the correct MCP server URL: `https://mcp.tallyfy.com`

**"Authentication failed or keeps expiring"**
- Re-authorize the OAuth connection in ChatGPT Settings → Connectors
- Check if your ChatGPT and Tallyfy subscriptions are both active
- Verify you have at least Standard user role in Tallyfy
- Clear browser cache and try reconnecting

**"ChatGPT says it can't access certain tools"**
- Verify the OAuth scopes were approved during connection
- Check that your Tallyfy user role has permissions for that operation
- Some write operations require Administrator role

**"Search results are empty or incomplete"**
- Make search queries more specific
- Check that the items you're searching for actually exist in your workspace
- Verify your Tallyfy user account has permission to view those items

### Advanced usage patterns

**Cross-referencing multiple data sources**
```
You: "Find the employee onboarding template, get all its form fields,
then show me all active onboarding processes and highlight which fields
are most commonly left empty"

ChatGPT:
1. Uses get_all_templates to find onboarding template
2. Uses get_template to retrieve form field details
3. Uses search_for_processes to find active onboarding processes
4. Analyzes and summarizes field completion patterns
```

**Bulk analysis and reporting**
```
You: "Get all tasks assigned to the sales team, categorize them by type,
and create a summary showing workload distribution"

ChatGPT:
1. Uses search_for_tasks with sales team filter
2. Analyzes task titles and descriptions
3. Groups by category
4. Generates distribution report
```

**Template optimization insights**
```
You: "Compare the Customer Support and Bug Triage templates, identify
common steps, and suggest opportunities for consolidation"

ChatGPT:
1. Uses get_template for both templates
2. Extracts and compares step configurations
3. Identifies duplicated logic
4. Suggests optimization opportunities
```

### Getting started checklist

1. **Verify subscription**: Ensure you have ChatGPT Plus or ChatGPT Pro (Team/Enterprise not yet supported)
2. **Enable Developer Mode**: ChatGPT Settings → Apps and Connectors → Advanced Settings → Enable Developer Mode
3. **Create Connector**: Settings → Connectors → Create → Name: "Tallyfy"
4. **Add MCP server URL**: `https://mcp.tallyfy.com`
5. **Authorize OAuth connection**: Log in to Tallyfy and approve permissions
6. **Test with simple query**: "Show me my tasks" or "List all templates"
7. **Try advanced queries**: Search, filter, and analyze your workflow data
8. **Monitor usage**: Review which tools are most helpful for your workflow

**For developers**: OpenAI's MCP documentation at `platform.openai.com/docs/mcp` provides technical details on building custom MCP servers. The Apps SDK (`developers.openai.com/apps-sdk`) enables building custom UIs for enhanced user experiences.
