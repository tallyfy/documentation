## Connect Claude to Tallyfy through MCP

Both Claude.ai (web) and Claude Desktop connect to Tallyfy through the MCP server[^1] at `https://mcp.tallyfy.com`. Once connected, Claude can read your tasks, processes, templates, and team members - then take actions on your behalf using natural language.

The connection uses OAuth 2.1 with PKCE[^2]. Claude handles the auth flow automatically when you add the server URL. You just sign in with your Tallyfy credentials and authorize access.

### Option 1: Claude.ai web (browser)

Available on paid Claude plans (Pro, Max, Team, Enterprise). Once added, the connector syncs across Claude web, Claude Desktop, and Claude Mobile.

<Steps>

1. **Open Claude.ai settings**

   Go to [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) and click your profile icon in the top-left corner, then select **Settings**.

2. **Go to Connectors**

   In Settings, click **Connectors** in the left sidebar.

3. **Add a custom connector**

   Click **Add custom connector**. Enter:

   - **Name**: Tallyfy
   - **URL**: `https://mcp.tallyfy.com`

   Then click **Save**.

4. **Authorize with your Tallyfy account**

   Claude.ai opens a browser window to Tallyfy's authorization page. Sign in with your Tallyfy credentials and click **Authorize** to grant Claude access to your organization.

5. **Verify the connection**

   Start a new conversation. The Tallyfy connector appears in your active integrations. Try:

   ```text
   What are my open tasks in Tallyfy?
   ```

   Claude calls `get_my_tasks` and returns your current task list.

</Steps>

### Option 2: Claude Desktop app

Available on paid Claude plans (Pro, Max, Team, Enterprise). Download for macOS or Windows.

<Steps>

1. **Install or update Claude Desktop**

   Download from [claude.ai/download](https://claude.ai/download). Remote MCP server support with OAuth requires a recent version.

2. **Open settings**

   Launch Claude Desktop, then open **Settings**. On macOS use Cmd+, or click the Claude menu - then **Settings**. On Windows use the gear icon or the application menu.

3. **Go to Integrations**

   Navigate to the **Integrations** tab (labelled **Extensions** or **MCP servers** in some versions).

4. **Add the Tallyfy MCP server**

   Click **Add integration**, **Add remote server**, or the **+** button. Enter:

   ```text
   https://mcp.tallyfy.com
   ```

   Claude Desktop discovers the OAuth endpoints automatically - no manual configuration needed.

5. **Authorize with your Tallyfy account**

   Claude Desktop opens a browser window to Tallyfy's authorization page. Sign in and click **Authorize**. The token is stored in your OS keychain (macOS Keychain or Windows Credential Manager) - never in plaintext.

6. **Restart Claude Desktop**

   Quit completely (Cmd+Q on macOS) and relaunch. This ensures the MCP connection initializes cleanly.

7. **Verify the connection**

   Open a new conversation. Look for the tools icon at the bottom of the chat input - clicking it shows available Tallyfy tools. Try:

   ```text
   What are my open tasks in Tallyfy?
   ```

   Claude calls `get_my_tasks` and returns your current task list.

</Steps>

## How Claude integration works

Tallyfy's MCP server runs on Cloudflare at `https://mcp.tallyfy.com` and exposes your Tallyfy data as tools Claude can call during a conversation.

The flow works like this:

1. **Tool discovery** - Claude connects and queries the MCP server for available tools
2. **OAuth 2.1 authentication** - Claude handles the auth flow. You sign in with Tallyfy credentials and authorize access
3. **Tool calls** - When you ask a question, Claude picks the right Tallyfy tool and passes the correct parameters
4. **API execution** - The MCP server uses your credentials to call the Tallyfy API and returns structured results
5. **Response** - Claude formats the data into a natural language answer

### Authentication architecture

The MCP server uses OAuth 2.1 with PKCE (S256). All discovery and token exchange happens through `https://mcp.tallyfy.com`, which proxies to Tallyfy's authorization server:

| Endpoint | URL |
|---|---|
| MCP server | `https://mcp.tallyfy.com` |
| Protected resource metadata | `https://mcp.tallyfy.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` |
| Authorization server metadata | `https://mcp.tallyfy.com/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` |
| Authorization (proxy) | `https://mcp.tallyfy.com/mcp/oauth/authorize` |
| Token exchange (proxy) | `https://mcp.tallyfy.com/mcp/oauth/token` |
| Client registration (proxy) | `https://mcp.tallyfy.com/mcp/oauth/register` |
| JWKS (token verification) | `https://mcp.tallyfy.com/.well-known/jwks.json` |

**Supported OAuth scopes**:

| Scope | Access |
|---|---|
| `mcp.tasks.read` | Read tasks and assignments |
| `mcp.tasks.write` | Create, update, and complete tasks |
| `mcp.processes.read` | Read workflow runs |
| `mcp.processes.write` | Launch, update, and archive processes |
| `mcp.templates.read` | Read templates and steps |
| `mcp.templates.write` | Edit templates, steps, and automations |
| `mcp.forms.read` | Read form fields |
| `mcp.forms.write` | Add and modify form fields |
| `mcp.users.read` | Read organization members and guests |
| `mcp.users.write` | Invite and manage users |
| `mcp.automation.read` | Read automation rules |
| `mcp.automation.write` | Create and modify automations |

### Practical examples

**Template health audit**
```text
Prompt: "Assess the health of our Customer Onboarding template and
suggest improvements to the automation rules."

Claude calls: assess_template_health -> analyze_template_automations ->
suggest_automation_consolidation, then summarizes findings and
recommended fixes.
```

**Process launch and tracking**
```text
Prompt: "Launch the Employee Onboarding template for Jane Doe and
show me all the tasks that were created."

Claude calls: launch_process -> get_tasks_for_process, then lists
every task with assignees and deadlines.
```

**Writing effective prompts for Claude**

Be specific about what you want analyzed and how you want the output structured:

```text
Good: "Analyze the proposal considering technical feasibility, financial
viability, strategic alignment, and risk factors. Provide weighted scoring
for each dimension with detailed justification."

Bad: "Review the proposal and approve or reject."
```

Give Claude explicit reasoning steps:

```text
Good: "First, identify all people affected. Second, analyze impact
on each group. Third, recommend mitigation strategies. Finally, provide
an implementation timeline."

Bad: "Figure out who this affects and what to do."
```

### Security and compliance

- **No training on your data** - Anthropic does not train on API inputs
- **JWT validation** - Tokens validated via RS256 using Tallyfy's public key. Only Tallyfy can issue valid tokens
- **OS keychain storage** - Claude Desktop stores tokens in macOS Keychain or Windows Credential Manager, never in plaintext
- **Data isolation** - Each organization's data stays separate
- **Audit logging** - Complete interaction history
- **SOC 2 Type II** - Anthropic maintains compliance

### Troubleshooting

**"MCP tools icon doesn't appear"**
- Restart Claude Desktop completely (Cmd+Q on macOS, not just closing the window)
- Check **Settings** - then **Integrations** to confirm `https://mcp.tallyfy.com` is listed and active
- If the server shows an error, remove and re-add it

**"Authorization fails or loops"**
- Confirm you're signing in with the Tallyfy account that has access to the target organization
- Open `https://mcp.tallyfy.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` in your browser - a JSON response means the server is reachable
- Clear Claude Desktop's stored credentials and re-authorize from scratch

**"SSE connection errors"**
- SSE transport is no longer supported. The Tallyfy MCP server uses Streamable HTTP only
- Update Claude Desktop to the latest version, which defaults to Streamable HTTP

### Best practices

1. **Start with read-only tools** - Use `get_my_tasks`, `search_for_processes`, and `get_all_templates` first to get familiar with the data before running write operations
2. **Be specific** - Name the template, process, or user explicitly. Claude performs best with complete context
3. **Add human checkpoints** - For write operations like creating automation rules, review Claude's plan before confirming
4. **Iterate on prompts** - Review Claude's outputs and refine your instructions over time

### Cost and plan requirements

- Requires a paid Claude plan (Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise)
- No additional Tallyfy charges for MCP usage
- MCP tool calls count toward your Anthropic usage limits

[^1]: Model Context Protocol - Anthropic's open standard letting AI models call external tools and access data securely
[^2]: Proof Key for Code Exchange - prevents authorization code interception attacks during the OAuth flow
