## Connecting Claude Desktop to Tallyfy

Your Claude subscription connects to Tallyfy through the MCP server at `https://mcp.tallyfy.com`. Once connected, Claude gets direct access to your tasks, processes, templates, and team members - letting it read context, take actions, and complete work on your behalf using natural language.

The connection uses OAuth 2.1 with PKCE. Claude Desktop handles the entire auth flow automatically when you add the server URL - you just sign in with your Tallyfy credentials and authorize access.

<Steps>

1. **Install or update Claude Desktop**

   Download Claude Desktop from [claude.ai/download](https://claude.ai/download) for macOS or Windows. Make sure you're on a recent version - remote MCP server support with OAuth requires a current release.

2. **Open Claude Desktop Settings**

   Launch Claude Desktop, then open **Settings**. On macOS use Cmd+, or click the Claude menu → **Settings**. On Windows use the gear icon or the application menu.

3. **Go to the Integrations or Extensions section**

   In Settings, navigate to the **Integrations** tab (sometimes labelled **Extensions** or **MCP servers** depending on your version).

4. **Add the Tallyfy MCP server**

   Click **Add integration**, **Add remote server**, or the **+** button. Enter the Tallyfy MCP server URL:

   ```text
   https://mcp.tallyfy.com
   ```

   Claude Desktop automatically discovers the OAuth endpoints by querying `https://mcp.tallyfy.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` - no manual endpoint configuration needed.

5. **Authorize access with your Tallyfy account**

   Claude Desktop opens a browser window to Tallyfy's authorization page. Sign in with the email and password you use for Tallyfy, then click **Authorize** to grant Claude access to your organization. The token is stored securely using your OS keychain (macOS Keychain on Mac, Windows Credential Manager on Windows).

6. **Restart Claude Desktop**

   Quit Claude Desktop completely (Cmd+Q on macOS) and relaunch it. This ensures the MCP connection initializes cleanly on startup.

7. **Verify the connection**

   Open a new conversation. Look for the tools icon (🔨) at the bottom of the chat input - clicking it shows the available Tallyfy tools. Try a quick test:

   ```text
   What are my open tasks in Tallyfy?
   ```

   Claude calls `get_my_tasks` and returns your current task list.

</Steps>

## How Claude integration works

Claude integration leverages Anthropic's MCP (Model Context Protocol) framework. The Tallyfy MCP server runs on Cloudflare at `https://mcp.tallyfy.com` and exposes your Tallyfy data as tools Claude can call during a conversation.

The architecture:

1. **Tool discovery**: When Claude Desktop connects, it queries the MCP server for the list of available tools
2. **OAuth 2.1 authentication**: The MCP server acts as an OAuth proxy - it forwards auth requests to Tallyfy's authorization server at `https://account.tallyfy.com` and validates JWT tokens using RS256 signature verification
3. **Tool calls**: When you ask Claude a question, it calls the appropriate Tallyfy tool with the right parameters
4. **API execution**: The MCP server uses your credentials to call the Tallyfy API and returns structured results
5. **Response**: Claude formats the data into a natural language answer in your chat

Claude excels at tasks requiring deep analysis, careful reasoning, and nuanced judgment - perfect for complex workflow decisions.

### Authentication architecture

The MCP server uses OAuth 2.1 with PKCE (S256). All discovery and token exchange happens through `https://mcp.tallyfy.com`, which proxies to Tallyfy's authorization server:

| Endpoint | URL |
|---|---|
| MCP server | `https://mcp.tallyfy.com` |
| Protected resource metadata | `https://mcp.tallyfy.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` |
| OpenID configuration | `https://mcp.tallyfy.com/.well-known/openid-configuration` |
| Authorization (proxy) | `https://mcp.tallyfy.com/mcp/oauth/authorize` |
| Token exchange (proxy) | `https://mcp.tallyfy.com/mcp/oauth/token` |
| Client registration (proxy) | `https://mcp.tallyfy.com/mcp/oauth/register` |
| Tallyfy auth server | `https://account.tallyfy.com` |

### Task automation with Claude's strengths

#### Complex document analysis
Claude excels at understanding lengthy, complex documents:
- Legal contract review with clause-by-clause analysis
- Technical documentation review for accuracy and completeness
- Research synthesis from multiple sources
- Compliance audit against detailed requirements

#### Multi-step reasoning
Claude handles tasks requiring careful thought:
```text
Task: Evaluate Project Proposal
Claude instruction: "Review the attached proposal against our evaluation
criteria. Score each section (feasibility, budget, timeline, risk).
Identify any gaps or concerns. Provide a detailed recommendation with
specific conditions for approval."
```

#### Writing and documentation
Claude generates high-quality written content:
```text
Task: Create Process Documentation
Claude instruction: "Based on the process steps completed so far, write
detailed documentation including: purpose, prerequisites, step-by-step
steps, common issues, and best practices. Format in our standard
template structure."
```

#### Data analysis with context
Claude understands nuanced data patterns:
```text
Task: Analyze Customer Feedback
Claude instruction: "Review all feedback from this quarter. Identify
recurring themes, sentiment patterns, and emerging issues. Correlate
with product changes. Generate actionable insights for each department."
```

### Real-world automation examples

**RFP response generation**
```text
Workflow: RFP Response Process
Claude's role: Reads RFP requirements, matches against your capabilities
database, generates tailored responses for each section, flags areas
needing human input, maintains consistent tone and messaging.
```

**Employee performance reviews**
```text
Workflow: Quarterly Review Process
Claude's role: Synthesizes feedback from multiple sources, identifies
patterns and growth areas, drafts balanced review narrative, suggests
specific development goals, ensures consistency across reviews.
```

**Template health audits**
```text
Prompt: "Assess the health of our Customer Onboarding template and
suggest improvements to the automation rules."

Claude calls: assess_template_health → analyze_template_automations →
suggest_automation_consolidation, then summarizes findings and
recommended fixes.
```

### Claude-specific instruction patterns

**Leverage Claude's analytical depth**
```text
Good: "Analyze the proposal considering technical feasibility, financial
viability, strategic alignment, and risk factors. Provide weighted scoring
for each dimension with detailed justification."

Bad: "Review the proposal and approve or reject."
```

**Use Claude's context window effectively**
```text
Good: "Using all previous task responses in this process, identify
patterns and generate a complete summary highlighting key decisions
and their rationales."

Bad: "Summarize this process."
```

**Enable structured reasoning**
```text
Good: "First, identify all stakeholders affected. Second, analyze impact
on each group. Third, recommend mitigation strategies. Finally, provide
an implementation timeline."

Bad: "Figure out who this affects and what to do."
```

### Advanced Claude features

**Long context handling**
Claude handles up to 200K tokens (1M in beta for some models):
- Entire process histories
- Multiple document attachments
- Full analysis across steps
- Pattern recognition over time

**Multilingual capabilities**
Claude processes multiple languages:
- Automatic language detection
- Translation with context preservation
- Cultural nuance awareness
- Localized content generation

### Performance optimization

**Context management strategies**:
- Send only relevant historical data
- Summarize previous steps when possible
- Use references instead of full documents
- Implement progressive disclosure

**Token optimization**:
```text
Efficient: "Analyze Section 3.2 of the contract for liability terms"
Wasteful: "Read the entire contract and find liability information"
```

**Response formatting**:
```text
Structured: "Return as JSON: {approved: boolean, reason: string, conditions: array}"
Unstructured: "Tell me your thoughts on this"
```

### Security and compliance

Claude integration maintains enterprise security:

- **No training on your data**: Anthropic doesn't train on API inputs
- **JWT validation**: Tokens validated via RS256 using Tallyfy's public key - only Tallyfy can issue valid tokens
- **OS keychain storage**: Claude Desktop stores tokens in macOS Keychain or Windows Credential Manager, never in plaintext
- **Data isolation**: Each organization's data remains separate
- **Audit logging**: Complete interaction history
- **GDPR compliant**: Data deletion on request
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Anthropic maintains compliance

### Troubleshooting

**"MCP tools icon doesn't appear"**
- Restart Claude Desktop completely (Cmd+Q on macOS, not just closing the window)
- Check Settings → Integrations to confirm `https://mcp.tallyfy.com` is listed and active
- If the server shows an error, try removing and re-adding it

**"Authorization fails or loops"**
- Make sure you're signing in with the Tallyfy account that has access to the organization
- Try opening `https://mcp.tallyfy.com/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` in your browser - if you get a JSON response, the server is reachable
- Clear Claude Desktop's stored credentials and re-authorize from scratch

**"Claude times out on complex tasks"**
- Break into smaller subtasks
- Reduce context window size
- Implement checkpoints for long analyses

**"Responses lack specific details"**
- Provide more context in your prompts
- Include examples of the desired output format
- Reference specific data fields by name

**"SSE connection errors"**
- SSE transport is no longer supported - the Tallyfy MCP server uses Streamable HTTP only
- Update your Claude Desktop to the latest version, which defaults to Streamable HTTP

### Implementation best practices

1. **Start with read-only tools**: Use `get_my_tasks`, `search_for_processes`, and `get_all_templates` first to get familiar with the data before running write operations
2. **Provide clear context**: Claude performs best with complete information - name the template, process, or user explicitly
3. **Use structured formats**: Define expected output schemas for consistent results
4. **Implement review steps**: Add human checkpoints for critical decisions like creating automation rules
5. **Monitor and iterate**: Review Claude's outputs to refine your prompts over time

### Cost considerations

Using your Claude subscription efficiently:
- Claude Pro: $20/month for individual use
- Claude Team: $25/user/month with higher limits and admin controls
- Claude Max: $100-200/month for higher usage limits
- No additional Tallyfy charges for MCP usage
- API calls count toward your Anthropic usage quotas

### Available Claude models

Tallyfy's MCP server works with all Claude models through your subscription:

- **Claude Opus 4.5**: Anthropic's flagship model with the strongest reasoning and agentic capabilities. Best for complex multi-step analysis and long-horizon tasks.
- **Claude Sonnet 4.5**: Best balance of speed and capability with a 1M token context window (beta). Strong coding performance.
- **Claude Sonnet 4**: Fast hybrid model with extended thinking for deeper reasoning when needed.
- **Claude Haiku 4.5**: Fastest and most cost-efficient option, matching Sonnet 4 on many tasks. Good for quick lookups and task creation.

All models support text and image input, multilingual capabilities, and extended reasoning modes.

Claude brings sophisticated analysis to every workflow. Complex decisions that took hours of human review now happen automatically, with reasoning you can trust and audit.
