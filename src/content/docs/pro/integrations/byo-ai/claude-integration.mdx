## Connecting Claude for intelligent workflow automation

Your Claude Pro or Team subscription brings advanced reasoning and analytical capabilities directly into Tallyfy workflows. Through Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers and OAuth2, Claude reads your task context, applies sophisticated analysis, and completes complex work that requires nuanced understanding - using the Claude subscription you already have.

### How Claude integration works

Claude integration leverages Anthropic's MCP (Model Context Protocol) framework for secure, intelligent connections:

1. **MCP server setup**: Tallyfy hosts MCP servers that Claude can connect to
2. **OAuth2 authentication**: Secure authorization links your Claude account
3. **Context window optimization**: Smart chunking sends relevant task data
4. **Advanced reasoning**: Claude processes with its full analytical capabilities
5. **Structured responses**: Results flow back in formats Tallyfy understands

Claude excels at tasks requiring deep analysis, careful reasoning, and nuanced judgment - perfect for complex workflow decisions.

### Authentication architecture

Claude uses enterprise-grade OAuth2 with MCP extensions:

**Authorization endpoint**: `https://go.tallyfy.com/mcp/oauth/authorize`
**Token endpoint**: `https://go.tallyfy.com/mcp/oauth/token`
**MCP server**: `https://go.tallyfy.com/mcp/server`
**Required scopes**: `mcp:tasks`, `mcp:processes`, `mcp:files`

The MCP protocol adds:
- Tool discovery for available Tallyfy actions
- Schema validation for data integrity
- Secure sandboxing of operations
- Audit trails for every interaction

### Task automation with Claude's strengths

#### Complex document analysis
Claude excels at understanding lengthy, complex documents:
- Legal contract review with clause-by-clause analysis
- Technical documentation review for accuracy and completeness
- Research synthesis from multiple sources
- Compliance audit against detailed requirements

#### Multi-step reasoning
Claude handles tasks requiring careful thought:
```
Task: Evaluate Project Proposal
Claude instruction: "Review the attached proposal against our evaluation
criteria. Score each section (feasibility, budget, timeline, risk).
Identify any gaps or concerns. Provide a detailed recommendation with
specific conditions for approval."
```

#### Writing and documentation
Claude generates high-quality written content:
```
Task: Create Process Documentation
Claude instruction: "Based on the process steps completed so far, write
detailed documentation including: purpose, prerequisites, step-by-step
steps, common issues, and best practices. Format in our standard
template structure."
```

#### Data analysis with context
Claude understands nuanced data patterns:
```
Task: Analyze Customer Feedback
Claude instruction: "Review all feedback from this quarter. Identify
recurring themes, sentiment patterns, and emerging issues. Correlate
with product changes. Generate actionable insights for each department."
```

### Real-world automation examples

**RFP response generation**
```
Workflow: RFP Response Process
Claude's role: Reads RFP requirements, matches against your capabilities
database, generates tailored responses for each section, flags areas
needing human input, maintains consistent tone and messaging.
```

**Employee performance reviews**
```
Workflow: Quarterly Review Process
Claude's role: Synthesizes feedback from multiple sources, identifies
patterns and growth areas, drafts balanced review narrative, suggests
specific development goals, ensures consistency across reviews.
```

**Incident analysis and reporting**
```
Workflow: Incident Management
Claude's role: Analyzes incident details, determines root cause,
assesses impact and severity, generates detailed report with timeline,
recommends preventive measures.
```

### Claude-specific instruction patterns

**Leverage Claude's analytical depth**
```
Good: "Analyze the proposal considering technical feasibility, financial
viability, strategic alignment, and risk factors. Provide weighted scoring
for each dimension with detailed justification."

Bad: "Review the proposal and approve or reject."
```

**Use Claude's context window effectively**
```
Good: "Using all previous task responses in this process, identify
patterns and generate a complete summary highlighting key decisions
and their rationales."

Bad: "Summarize this process."
```

**Enable structured reasoning**
```
Good: "First, identify all stakeholders affected. Second, analyze impact
on each group. Third, recommend mitigation strategies. Finally, provide
an implementation timeline."

Bad: "Figure out who this affects and what to do."
```

### MCP server capabilities

The Tallyfy MCP server exposes these tools to Claude:

**Task operations**
- `get_task`: Retrieve full task context
- `complete_task`: Mark task complete with data
- `add_comment`: Add analytical comments
- `update_fields`: Fill form fields with generated content

**Process operations**
- `get_process_history`: Access complete process context
- `trigger_automation`: Initiate conditional branches
- `create_subtask`: Generate follow-up tasks

**File operations**
- `read_attachment`: Extract and analyze file contents
- `generate_document`: Create formatted documents
- `update_template`: Suggest process improvements

### Advanced Claude features

**Constitutional AI alignment**
Claude follows ethical guidelines automatically:
- Refuses inappropriate requests
- Maintains data privacy
- Provides balanced analysis
- Explains reasoning transparently

**Long context handling**
Claude handles up to 200K tokens (1M in beta for Sonnet 4.5):
- Entire process histories
- Multiple document attachments
- Full analysis across steps
- Pattern recognition over time

**Multilingual capabilities**
Claude processes multiple languages:
- Automatic language detection
- Translation with context preservation
- Cultural nuance awareness
- Localized content generation

### Performance optimization

**Context management strategies**:
- Send only relevant historical data
- Summarize previous steps when possible
- Use references instead of full documents
- Implement progressive disclosure

**Token optimization**:
```
Efficient: "Analyze Section 3.2 of the contract for liability terms"
Wasteful: "Read the entire contract and find liability information"
```

**Response formatting**:
```
Structured: "Return as JSON: {approved: boolean, reason: string, conditions: array}"
Unstructured: "Tell me your thoughts on this"
```

### Security and compliance

Claude integration maintains enterprise security:

- **No training on your data**: Anthropic doesn't train on API inputs
- **Data isolation**: Each organization's data remains separate
- **Audit logging**: Complete interaction history
- **GDPR compliant**: Data deletion on request
- **SOC 2 Type II**: Anthropic maintains compliance

### Troubleshooting

**"Claude times out on complex tasks"**
- Break into smaller subtasks
- Reduce context window size
- Implement checkpoints for long analyses

**"Responses lack specific details"**
- Provide more context in instructions
- Include examples of desired output
- Reference specific data fields

**"MCP connection fails"**
- Verify OAuth tokens are current
- Check MCP server endpoint availability
- Review permission scopes

### Implementation best practices

1. **Start with high-value tasks**: Focus on complex decisions requiring analysis
2. **Provide clear context**: Claude performs best with complete information
3. **Use structured formats**: Define expected output schemas
4. **Implement review steps**: Add human checkpoints for critical decisions
5. **Monitor and iterate**: Review Claude's outputs to refine instructions

### Cost considerations

Using your Claude subscription efficiently:
- Claude Pro: $20/month for individual use
- Claude Team: $25/user/month with higher limits
- No additional Tallyfy charges for BYO AI
- API calls count toward your Anthropic quotas

### Available Claude models

Tallyfy works with all current Claude models through your subscription:

- **Claude Opus 4.5**: Anthropic's flagship model with the strongest reasoning, coding, and agentic capabilities. Ideal for complex multi-step analysis and long-horizon tasks.
- **Claude Sonnet 4.5**: Best balance of speed and capability. State-of-the-art coding performance with 1M token context window (beta).
- **Claude Sonnet 4**: Fast hybrid model with extended thinking for deeper reasoning when needed.
- **Claude Haiku 4.5**: Fastest and most cost-efficient option, matching Sonnet 4 performance on many tasks.

All models support text and image input, multilingual capabilities, and vision for document analysis.

Claude brings sophisticated analysis to every workflow. Complex decisions that took hours of human review now happen automatically, with reasoning you can trust and audit.
