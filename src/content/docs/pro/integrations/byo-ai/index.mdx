:::note[MCP industry standard]
BYO AI uses MCP (Model Context Protocol), the industry standard for connecting AI to business tools. In December 2025, MCP was donated to the Agentic AI Foundation under the Linux Foundation - co-founded by Anthropic, Block, and OpenAI, with AWS, Google, Microsoft, Cloudflare, and Bloomberg as supporting members. All major AI platforms now support MCP.

## Put your AI subscription to work inside Tallyfy workflows

BYO AI (Bring Your Own AI) connects your existing AI subscriptions - ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro, Google Gemini, or Microsoft Copilot - directly into your Tallyfy workflows. Your AI becomes a team member that completes tasks, writes documents, analyzes data, and makes decisions right inside running processes.

Most people have AI subscriptions they barely use. BYO AI changes that by embedding AI assistance into your actual workflow steps - so it works for you automatically, using the subscription you're already paying for.

### Why this matters

Without BYO AI, using AI in a workflow means copying text from a document, pasting it into ChatGPT, waiting for a response, then copying that back into another system. It's manual and disconnected.

BYO AI eliminates this. When a task lands in someone's queue, the AI can:
- Read the task context and form field data
- Execute based on your custom instructions
- Complete the task or add detailed comments
- Move the process forward automatically

No prompt engineering needed. No app-switching. The AI works right where the work happens.

### How authentication works

BYO AI authenticates through OAuth2 - the same secure method you use when signing into websites with Google or Microsoft.

1. **You authorize once** - connect your AI account to Tallyfy through a secure OAuth flow
2. **Tallyfy stores tokens** - authentication tokens are stored securely (never your password)
3. **AI acts on your behalf** - when triggered, Tallyfy sends instructions to your AI using your subscription
4. **Results flow back** - the AI's response automatically updates the task or completes the action

Your subscription stays yours. Tallyfy just bridges your workflows and your AI assistant.

### Supported AI platforms

### Key capabilities

#### Task automation
Your AI can automatically complete tasks based on:
- Form field values from previous steps
- Document attachments and their contents
- Historical process data and patterns
- Custom instructions embedded in templates

#### Content generation
Instead of blank form fields, users see AI-generated suggestions:
- Draft emails based on process context
- Reports from collected data
- Summaries of long documents
- Translations into multiple languages

#### Decision support
AI analyzes data and provides recommendations:
- Risk assessment based on form responses
- Approval recommendations with reasoning
- Priority scoring for incoming requests
- Anomaly detection in submitted data

#### Process optimization
AI learns from your workflow patterns:
- Suggests process improvements
- Identifies bottlenecks
- Recommends task reassignments
- Predicts completion times

### Common use cases

**Document processing** - AI reads uploaded contracts, extracts key terms, and populates form fields automatically. No more manual data entry from PDFs.

**Customer service** - AI drafts responses to customer inquiries based on your knowledge base and previous successful responses. Agents review and send.

**Compliance reviews** - AI checks submissions against your compliance rules, flags issues, and suggests corrections before human review.

**Meeting follow-ups** - AI reads meeting transcripts, extracts action items, and creates follow-up tasks in the right processes.

**Data analysis** - AI analyzes spreadsheet uploads, generates insights, and creates summary reports without anyone opening Excel.

### Implementation status

BYO AI is live and actively developed:

**Phase 1 - Direct integration** - available now
- OAuth 2.1 connection to all major AI platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot)
- Task completion and commenting via natural language
- MCP server with full tool support

**Phase 2 - Advanced automation** - in development
- Multi-step AI workflows
- Conditional AI actions based on responses
- AI-to-AI handoffs between steps

**Phase 3 - Learning and optimization** - planned
- AI learns from your process history
- Suggests template improvements
- Predictive automation

### Security and control

- **Subscription isolation** - each organization uses their own AI subscription
- **Data boundaries** - AI only accesses data from the specific process context
- **Audit trails** - every AI action is logged with inputs and outputs
- **Human oversight** - configure which tasks require human review
- **Revocation** - disconnect AI access instantly if needed

### Getting started

BYO AI uses OAuth 2.1 with PKCE for secure authentication:

1. Configure your AI platform (ChatGPT, Claude Desktop, Google Gemini, or Microsoft Copilot) with Tallyfy's MCP server
2. Complete the OAuth authorization flow to connect your Tallyfy account
3. Grant permissions for the scopes your AI needs (tasks, processes, templates, users, read, write)
4. Your AI can now interact with Tallyfy using natural language

**Technical endpoints** (live):
- MCP Server: `https://mcp.tallyfy.com`
- OAuth Authorization: `https://go.tallyfy.com/mcp/oauth/authorize`
- OAuth Token: `https://go.tallyfy.com/mcp/oauth/token`
- Dynamic Client Registration: `https://go.tallyfy.com/mcp/oauth/register`
- OAuth Metadata: `https://go.tallyfy.com/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`

**Available scopes**: `mcp:tasks`, `mcp:processes`, `mcp:templates`, `mcp:users`, `mcp:read`, `mcp:write`
