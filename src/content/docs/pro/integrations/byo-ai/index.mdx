## Connecting your AI subscription to automate Tallyfy workflows

BYO AI (Bring Your Own AI) is Tallyfy's upcoming integration framework that connects your existing AI subscriptions - ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro, or Microsoft Copilot - directly into your workflows. Your AI becomes a team member that can complete tasks, write documents, analyze data, and make decisions right inside Tallyfy processes.

Here's the reality: most people have AI subscriptions they barely use. They open ChatGPT occasionally, ask a question, then go back to manual work. BYO AI changes that. It embeds AI assistance into your actual workflow steps, so the AI works for you automatically, using the subscription you're already paying for.

### Why BYO AI matters for workflow automation

Think about how AI typically gets used in organizations. Someone copies text from a document, pastes it into ChatGPT, waits for a response, then copies that response back into another system. It's manual, disconnected, and defeats the purpose of automation.

BYO AI eliminates this copy-paste chaos. When a task lands in someone's queue, the AI can:
- Read the task context and form field data
- Execute based on your custom instructions
- Complete the task or add detailed comments
- Move the process forward automatically

No prompt engineering skills needed. No switching between apps. The AI just works, right where the work happens.

### How BYO AI authentication works

The magic happens through OAuth2 authentication - the same secure method you use when signing into websites with Google or Microsoft. Here's the flow:

1. **You authorize once**: Connect your AI account to Tallyfy through a secure OAuth flow
2. **Tallyfy stores tokens**: We securely store authentication tokens (never your password)
3. **AI acts on your behalf**: When triggered, Tallyfy sends instructions to your AI using your subscription
4. **Results flow back**: The AI's response automatically updates the task or completes the action

Your AI subscription remains yours. We just provide the bridge between your workflows and your AI assistant.

### Supported AI platforms

### Key capabilities

#### Task automation
Your AI can automatically complete tasks based on:
- Form field values from previous steps
- Document attachments and their contents
- Historical process data and patterns
- Custom instructions you embed in templates

#### Intelligent content generation
Instead of blank form fields, users see AI-generated suggestions:
- Draft emails based on process context
- Generate reports from collected data
- Create summaries of long documents
- Translate content into multiple languages

#### Decision support
AI analyzes data and provides recommendations:
- Risk assessment based on form responses
- Approval recommendations with reasoning
- Priority scoring for incoming requests
- Anomaly detection in submitted data

#### Process optimization
AI learns from your workflow patterns:
- Suggests process improvements
- Identifies bottlenecks
- Recommends task reassignments
- Predicts completion times

### Common use cases

**Document processing**: AI reads uploaded contracts, extracts key terms, and populates form fields automatically. No more manual data entry from PDFs.

**Customer service**: AI drafts responses to customer inquiries based on your knowledge base and previous successful responses. Agents just review and send.

**Compliance reviews**: AI checks submissions against your compliance rules, flags issues, and suggests corrections before human review.

**Meeting follow-ups**: AI reads meeting transcripts, extracts action items, and creates follow-up tasks automatically in the right processes.

**Data analysis**: AI analyzes spreadsheet uploads, generates insights, and creates summary reports without anyone touching Excel.

### Implementation approach

BYO AI will roll out in phases:

**Phase 1 - Direct Integration** (Q2 2025)
- OAuth connection to AI platforms
- Basic task completion and commenting
- Simple instruction templates

**Phase 2 - Advanced Automation** (Q3 2025)
- Multi-step AI workflows
- Conditional AI actions based on responses
- AI-to-AI handoffs between steps

**Phase 3 - Learning & Optimization** (Q4 2025)
- AI learns from your process history
- Suggests template improvements
- Predictive automation

### Security and control

Your AI, your data, your control:
- **Subscription isolation**: Each organization uses their own AI subscription
- **Data boundaries**: AI only accesses data from the specific process context
- **Audit trails**: Every AI action is logged with inputs and outputs
- **Human oversight**: Configure which tasks require human review
- **Revocation**: Disconnect AI access instantly if needed

### Getting started (Coming Soon)

When BYO AI launches, setup will be simple:
1. Navigate to Settings > Integrations > BYO AI
2. Choose your AI platform (ChatGPT, Claude, or Copilot)
3. Authenticate with your AI account
4. Configure AI permissions and access levels
5. Start adding AI instructions to your templates

### The future of work with BYO AI

We're not replacing humans - we're amplifying them. BYO AI means your team focuses on decisions, relationships, and creative work while AI handles the repetitive, time-consuming tasks that slow everyone down.

Your AI subscription becomes an actual team member, not just a chat window. It knows your processes, follows your rules, and gets work done. That's the promise of BYO AI.
