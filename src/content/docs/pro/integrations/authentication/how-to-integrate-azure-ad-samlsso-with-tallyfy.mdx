## Azure Active Directory SSO Integration

You'll connect Microsoft Azure Active Directory to Tallyfy for seamless single sign-on in about 30 minutes. Your users get automatic authentication and account provisioning - no more password juggling.

:::caution[Coordination Required]
SSO setup requires exchanging configuration details between your organization and Tallyfy. You can't complete this solo. Submit a support ticket to get started.
:::

### Requirements

- Azure subscription with Azure Active Directory access
- Administrator privileges in Azure AD
- Tallyfy Professional or Enterprise plan
- SAML configuration values from Tallyfy Support

### Implementation process overview

Here's what you'll do:
1. Create an Azure AD enterprise application
2. Configure SAML settings in both systems
3. Enable and test the SSO connection

## SSO configuration flow

This diagram shows how Azure AD, Tallyfy Support, and your admin work together to set up single sign-on.

```d2
Admin: "Admin"
Azure: "Azure"
Support: "Support"
Tallyfy: "Tallyfy"
User: "User"
Admin: Azure Admin
Azure: Azure AD
Support: Tallyfy Support
Tallyfy: Tallyfy Platform
User: End User

# SSO Setup Process
Admin -> Support: "1. Submit support ticket for SSO"
Support -> Admin: "2. Provide Tallyfy SAML values\n(SP ACS URL, SP Entity ID)"

Admin -> Azure: "3. Create Enterprise Application"
Admin -> Azure: "4. Configure SAML settings\nwith Tallyfy values"
Admin -> Azure: "5. Map user attributes\n(FirstName, LastName, Email)"

Azure -> Admin: "6. Provide Azure SAML info\n(Login URL, Azure ID, Certificate)"
Admin -> Support: "7. Send Azure SAML configuration"

Support -> Tallyfy: "8. Configure SAML settings"
Support -> Admin: "9. Confirm setup complete"
Admin -> Tallyfy: "10. Enable SAML toggle"

# User Authentication Flow
User -> Tallyfy: "11. Access SSO URL"
Tallyfy -> Azure: "12. Redirect to Azure AD"
User -> Azure: "13. Enter credentials"
Azure -> Azure: "14. Authenticate user"
Azure -> Tallyfy: "15. SAML assertion"
Tallyfy -> Tallyfy: "16. Provision/authenticate user"
Tallyfy -> User: "17. Grant access"
```

**What to notice:**
- Steps 1-10 show the one-time setup collaboration between your Azure Admin and Tallyfy Support
- Steps 12-18 demonstrate the user authentication flow that happens every time someone logs in
- The coordination requirement (step 1) is essential - you can't skip the support ticket

### Phase 1: Create Azure AD enterprise application

#### Step 1: Access enterprise applications

<Steps>
1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) with administrator credentials
2. Navigate to **Azure Active Directory** service
3. Select **Enterprise Applications** from the Manage section
4. Click **+New application**
5. Choose **Create your own application**

    ![Create new application](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/azuresso-1.png)
</Steps>

#### Step 2: Define application properties

<Steps>
1. Enter "Tallyfy" as the application name
2. Select **Integrate any other application you don't find in the gallery (Non-gallery)**
3. Click **Create**

    ![Define application properties](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/azuresso-2.png)
</Steps>

#### Step 3: Assign users (Optional)

Want to assign users right away? Go ahead. You can also do this after completing the setup:

    ![User assignment screen](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/azuresso-3.png)

### Phase 2: Configure SAML settings

#### Step 1: Access SAML configuration

<Steps>
1. In the application's sidebar under **Manage**, select **Single sign-on**
2. Choose **SAML** as the sign-on method

    ![Select SAML authentication](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/azuresso-4.png)
</Steps>

#### Step 2: Configure basic SAML settings

<Steps>
1. Click **Edit** in the Basic SAML Configuration section.

    ![Edit basic SAML configuration](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/azuresso-5.png)
2. Time to grab Tallyfy's SAML values. Head to your organization's profile in Tallyfy.
3. Navigate to the **Org Settings** tab.
4. Click **Add Configuration Details**.
5. Scroll down to find the default SAML values.

    ![Tallyfy SAML values](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/azuresso-7.png)
    ![Tallyfy default SAML values](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/azuresso-8.png)
6. Copy the Tallyfy **SP ACS URL** into Azure AD's **Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL)** field.
7. Copy the Tallyfy **SP Entity ID** into Azure AD's **Identifier (Entity ID)** field.
8. Click **Save**.

    ![Enter SAML values in Azure](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/azuresso-6.png)
</Steps>

#### Step 3: Configure user attributes

This step matters - get it wrong and users won't sync properly. Let's set up each attribute:

<Steps>
1. Configure the **Name Identifier (User ID)**: Click the **Unique User Identifier (Name ID)** row.

    ![Configure Name ID](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/azuresso-9.png)
2. Select **Persistent** for Name identifier format.
3. Choose **user.mail** for Source attribute.
4. Click **Save**.
5. Configure the **First Name Attribute**: Click the attribute row (typically user.givenname).

    ![Configure First Name attribute](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/azuresso-10.png)
6. Change **Name** to: `FirstName` (capitalization matters here).
7. Clear any value in the **Namespace** field.
8. Set **Source attribute** to: `user.givenname`.
9. Click **Save**.
10. Configure the **Email** attribute the same way: Set Name to `Email`, ensure Namespace is empty, and set Source attribute to `user.mail`. Click **Save**.
11. Configure the **Last Name** attribute similarly: Set Name to `LastName`, ensure Namespace is empty, and set Source attribute to `user.surname`. Click **Save**.
</Steps>

Your final attribute configuration should match this:

### Phase 3: Complete integration with Tallyfy

#### Step 1: Obtain Azure AD SAML information

Back in Azure AD, you'll need three things:

<Steps>
1. Navigate to the **Set up** section.
2. Copy the **Login URL**.
3. Copy the **Azure AD Identifier**.
4. Download the **Certificate (Base64)** from the SAML Signing Certificate section.

    ![Azure AD SAML information](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/azuresso-12.png)
</Steps>

#### Step 2: Configure Tallyfy with Azure AD information

<Steps>
1. Send the collected Azure AD SAML information to Tallyfy Support
2. Tallyfy Support will configure your organization's SAML settings with this information

    ![Tallyfy SAML configuration](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/azuresso-13.png)
</Steps>

#### Step 3: Enable SAML authentication

Once Tallyfy Support confirms your SAML settings are ready:

<Steps>
1. Flip the SAML activation toggle to enable SSO for your organization

    ![Enable SAML in Tallyfy](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/azuresso-14.png)
</Steps>

### User provisioning and access

You're almost done:

<Steps>
1. Get your organization's Tallyfy login URL from the SAML setup modal (Tallyfy Support provides this)
2. Share this URL with users who have Azure AD access

    ![Tallyfy login URL](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/azuresso-15.png)
</Steps>

What happens when users visit this URL?
- Existing Tallyfy users get authenticated instantly
- New users are automatically provisioned on their first login

### Troubleshooting

Users can't log in? Here's your troubleshooting checklist:
<Steps>
1. Verify the user is assigned to the Azure AD application.
2. Double-check attribute mappings - names and capitalization must be exact.
3. Confirm the SAML certificate hasn't expired.
4. Ensure users are using the SSO URL (not the regular login page).
5. Still stuck? Contact Tallyfy Support.
</Steps>
