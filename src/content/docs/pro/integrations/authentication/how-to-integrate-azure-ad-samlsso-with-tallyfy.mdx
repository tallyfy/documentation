## Microsoft Entra ID SSO Integration

You'll connect Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) to Tallyfy for single sign-on in about 30 minutes. Your users get automatic authentication and account provisioning - no more password juggling.


:::caution[Coordination Required]
SSO setup requires exchanging configuration details between your organization and Tallyfy. You can't complete this solo. Submit a support ticket to get started.
:::

### Requirements

- Microsoft Entra ID access
- Administrator privileges in Microsoft Entra ID
- Tallyfy Professional or Enterprise plan
- SAML configuration values from Tallyfy Support

### Implementation process overview

Here's what you'll do:
1. Create a Microsoft Entra ID enterprise application
2. Configure SAML settings in both systems
3. Enable and test the SSO connection

## SSO configuration flow

This diagram shows how Microsoft Entra ID, Tallyfy Support, and your admin work together to set up single sign-on.

**What to notice:**
- Steps 1-10 show the one-time setup collaboration between your Entra ID Admin and Tallyfy Support
- Steps 11-15 demonstrate the user authentication flow that happens every time someone logs in
- The coordination requirement (step 1) is essential - you can't skip the support ticket

### Phase 1: Create Microsoft Entra ID enterprise application

#### Step 1: Access enterprise applications

<Steps>
1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) with administrator credentials
2. Navigate to **Microsoft Entra ID** service (may still show as Azure Active Directory in some interfaces)
3. Select **Enterprise Applications** from the Manage section
4. Click **+New application**
5. Choose **Create your own application**

    ![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/azuresso-1.png)
</Steps>

#### Step 2: Define application properties

<Steps>
1. Enter "Tallyfy" as the application name
2. Select **Integrate any other application you don't find in the gallery (Non-gallery)**
3. Click **Create**

    ![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/azuresso-2.png)
</Steps>

#### Step 3: Assign users (Optional)

Want to assign users right away? Go ahead. You can also do this after completing the setup:

### Phase 2: Configure SAML settings

#### Step 1: Access SAML configuration

<Steps>
1. In the application's sidebar under **Manage**, select **Single sign-on**
2. Choose **SAML** as the sign-on method

    ![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/azuresso-4.png)
</Steps>

#### Step 2: Configure basic SAML settings

<Steps>
1. Click **Edit** in the Basic SAML Configuration section.

    ![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/azuresso-5.png)
2. Time to grab Tallyfy's SAML values. Head to your organization's profile in Tallyfy.
3. Navigate to the **Org Settings** tab.
4. Click **Add Configuration Details**.
5. Scroll down to find the default SAML values.

    ![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/azuresso-8.png)
6. Copy the Tallyfy **SP ACS URL** into Microsoft Entra ID's **Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL)** field.
7. Copy the Tallyfy **SP Entity ID** into Microsoft Entra ID's **Identifier (Entity ID)** field.
8. Click **Save**.

</Steps>

#### Step 3: Configure user attributes

This step matters - get it wrong and users won't sync properly. Let's set up each attribute:

<Steps>
1. Configure the **Name Identifier (User ID)**: Click the **Unique User Identifier (Name ID)** row.

    ![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/azuresso-9.png)
2. Select **Persistent** for Name identifier format.
3. Choose **user.mail** for Source attribute.
4. Click **Save**.
5. Configure the **First Name Attribute**: Click the attribute row (typically user.givenname).

    ![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/azuresso-10.png)
6. Change **Name** to: `FirstName` (capitalization matters here).
7. Clear any value in the **Namespace** field.
8. Set **Source attribute** to: `user.givenname`.
9. Click **Save**.
10. Configure the **Email** attribute the same way: Set Name to `Email`, ensure Namespace is empty, and set Source attribute to `user.mail`. Click **Save**.
11. Configure the **Last Name** attribute similarly: Set Name to `LastName`, ensure Namespace is empty, and set Source attribute to `user.surname`. Click **Save**.
</Steps>

Your final attribute configuration should match this:

### Phase 3: Complete integration with Tallyfy

#### Step 1: Obtain Microsoft Entra ID SAML information

Back in Microsoft Entra ID, you'll need three things:

<Steps>
1. Navigate to the **Set up** section.
2. Copy the **Login URL**.
3. Copy the **Microsoft Entra ID Identifier**.
4. Download the **Certificate (Base64)** from the SAML Signing Certificate section.

    ![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/azuresso-12.png)
</Steps>

#### Step 2: Configure Tallyfy with Microsoft Entra ID information

<Steps>
1. Send the collected Microsoft Entra ID SAML information to Tallyfy Support
2. Tallyfy Support will configure your organization's SAML settings with this information

    ![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/azuresso-13.png)
</Steps>

#### Step 3: Enable SAML authentication

Once Tallyfy Support confirms your SAML settings are ready:

<Steps>
1. Flip the SAML activation toggle to enable SSO for your organization

    ![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/azuresso-14.png)
</Steps>

### User provisioning and access

You're almost done:

<Steps>
1. Get your organization's Tallyfy login URL from the SAML setup modal (Tallyfy Support provides this)
2. Share this URL with users who have Microsoft Entra ID access

    ![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/azuresso-15.png)
</Steps>

What happens when users visit this URL?
- Existing Tallyfy users get authenticated instantly
- New users are automatically provisioned on their first login

### Troubleshooting

Users can't log in? Here's your troubleshooting checklist:
<Steps>
1. Verify the user is assigned to the Microsoft Entra ID application.
2. Double-check attribute mappings - names and capitalization must be exact.
3. Confirm the SAML certificate hasn't expired.
4. Ensure users are using the SSO URL (not the regular login page).
5. Still stuck? Contact Tallyfy Support.
</Steps>
