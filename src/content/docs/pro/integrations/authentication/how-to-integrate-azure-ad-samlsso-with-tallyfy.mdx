## Azure Active Directory SSO Integration

This guide covers the process of setting up SAML-based Single Sign-On (SSO) between Microsoft Azure Active Directory and Tallyfy. This integration allows automated user authentication and provisioning.

:::caution[Coordination Required]
SSO setup needs exchanging configuration information between your organization and Tallyfy. This process can't be completed independently. Please submit a support ticket to start the integration process.
:::

### Requirements

- Azure subscription with Azure Active Directory access
- Administrator privileges in Azure AD
- Tallyfy Professional or Enterprise plan
- SAML configuration values from Tallyfy Support

### Implementation process overview

The integration includes three main phases:
1. Creating and setting up an Azure AD enterprise application
2. Setting up SAML settings in both systems
3. Turning on and testing the SSO integration

### Phase 1: Create Azure AD enterprise application

#### Step 1: Access enterprise applications

<Steps>
1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) with administrator credentials
2. Go to **Azure Active Directory** service
3. Pick **Enterprise Applications** under the Manage section
4. Click **+New application**
5. Pick **Create your own application**

    ![Create new application](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/azuresso-1.png)
</Steps>

#### Step 2: Define application properties

<Steps>
1. Type "Tallyfy" as the application name
2. Pick **Integrate any other application you don't find in the gallery (Non-gallery)**
3. Click **Create**

    ![Define application properties](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/azuresso-2.png)
</Steps>

#### Step 3: Assign users (Optional)

You can assign users to the application now or after finishing the setup:

### Phase 2: Configure SAML settings

#### Step 1: Access SAML configuration

<Steps>
1. In the application's sidebar under **Manage**, pick **Single sign-on**
2. Pick **SAML** as the sign-on method

    ![Select SAML authentication](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/azuresso-4.png)
</Steps>

#### Step 2: Configure basic SAML settings

<Steps>
1. Click **Edit** in the Basic SAML Configuration section.

    ![Edit basic SAML configuration](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/azuresso-5.png)
2. Get Tallyfy's SAML values: Go to your organization's profile in Tallyfy.
3. Go to the **Org Settings** tab.
4. Click **Add Configuration Details**.
5. Scroll down to see the default SAML values.

6. Put the Tallyfy **SP ACS URL** into Azure AD's **Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL)** field.
7. Put the Tallyfy **SP Entity ID** into Azure AD's **Identifier (Entity ID)** field.
8. Click **Save**.

</Steps>

#### Step 3: Configure user attributes

This step is crucial for proper user identification and provisioning. Set up each attribute as follows:

<Steps>
1. Set up the **Name Identifier (User ID)**: Click the **Unique User Identifier (Name ID)** row.

    ![Configure Name ID](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/azuresso-9.png)
2. Pick **Persistent** for Name identifier format.
3. Pick **user.mail** for Source attribute.
4. Click **Save**.
5. Set up the **First Name Attribute**: Click the attribute row (e.g., user.givenname).

    ![Configure First Name attribute](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/azuresso-10.png)
6. Change **Name** to: `FirstName` (exact capitalization needed).
7. Clear any value in the **Namespace** field.
8. Set **Source attribute** to: `user.givenname`.
9. Click **Save**.
10. Set up the **Email** attribute using the same process: Set Name to `Email`, make sure Namespace is empty, and set Source attribute properly (e.g., `user.mail`). Click **Save**.
11. Set up the **Last Name** attribute using the same process: Set Name to `LastName`, make sure Namespace is empty, and set Source attribute properly (e.g., `user.surname`). Click **Save**.
</Steps>

The final attribute setup should look like this:

### Phase 3: Complete integration with Tallyfy

#### Step 1: Obtain Azure AD SAML information

From the Azure AD application setup:

<Steps>
1. Go to the **Set up** section.
2. Get the **Login URL**.
3. Get the **Azure AD Identifier**.
4. Download the **Certificate (Base64)** from the SAML Signing Certificate section.

    ![Azure AD SAML information](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/azuresso-12.png)
</Steps>

#### Step 2: Configure Tallyfy with Azure AD information

<Steps>
1. Give the collected Azure AD SAML information to Tallyfy Support
2. Tallyfy Support will put this information in your organization's SAML setup

    ![Tallyfy SAML configuration](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/azuresso-13.png)
</Steps>

#### Step 3: Enable SAML authentication

After Tallyfy Support sets up your SAML settings:

<Steps>
1. Switch the SAML activation toggle to turn on SSO for your organization

    ![Enable SAML in Tallyfy](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/azuresso-14.png)
</Steps>

### User provisioning and access

Once the integration finishes:

<Steps>
1. Get the Tallyfy login URL from the SAML setup modal (provided by Tallyfy Support)
2. Share this URL with your users who have access to the Azure AD application

    ![Tallyfy login URL](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/azuresso-15.png)
</Steps>

Users can now access Tallyfy through this URL:
- Existing Tallyfy users will get automatically authenticated
- New users will get set up in Tallyfy when they first log in

### Troubleshooting

If users run into authentication problems:
<Steps>
1. Check that the user has been assigned to the Azure AD application.
2. Make sure attribute mappings are set up correctly (exact names and capitalization).
3. Check that the SAML certificate hasn't expired.
4. Make sure users are accessing Tallyfy through the SSO URL.
5. Contact Tallyfy Support for help with ongoing issues.
</Steps>
