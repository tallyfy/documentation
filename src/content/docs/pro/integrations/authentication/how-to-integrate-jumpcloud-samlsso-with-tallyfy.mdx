## JumpCloud SAML/SSO integration

Connect JumpCloud with Tallyfy using SAML-based SSO for automatic user login and account creation. Setup takes about 30 minutes.

:::caution[Coordination required]
SSO setup requires exchanging configuration between your organization and Tallyfy. You can't complete this on your own - submit a support ticket to get started.
:::

### Requirements

- JumpCloud administrator account
- JumpCloud SSO Package or higher (or SSO add-on)
- Tallyfy Pro or Enterprise plan
- SAML configuration values from Tallyfy Support

### What you'll do

1. Create a custom SAML application in JumpCloud
2. Configure service provider settings and attribute mappings
3. Exchange metadata with Tallyfy Support and enable SSO

### Phase 1 - Create JumpCloud SAML application

#### Step 1 - Access SSO applications

<Steps>
1. Sign in to the JumpCloud Admin Portal
2. Go to **Access** from the main menu
3. Select **SSO Applications**
4. Click the **+** button to add a new application

5. Click **Custom SAML App**

    ![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/jumpcloud-sso-2.png)
</Steps>

#### Step 2 - Configure general info

<Steps>
1. Select the **General Info** tab
2. Enter "Tallyfy" as the **Display Label**
3. Optionally add a description and upload the Tallyfy logo
4. Click **Save**

    ![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/jumpcloud-sso-3.png)
</Steps>

### Phase 2 - Configure SAML settings

#### Step 1 - Get Tallyfy SAML values

Tallyfy's service provider configuration tells JumpCloud where to send authentication data.

<Steps>
1. Contact Tallyfy Support to access your organization's profile
2. Go to the **Org Settings** tab
3. Click **Add Configuration Details**
4. Locate the default SAML values section
5. You'll need two values:
   - **SP ACS URL** (Assertion Consumer Service URL)
   - **SP Entity ID** (Service Provider Entity ID)
</Steps>

#### Step 2 - Enter service provider details in JumpCloud

<Steps>
1. In your JumpCloud SAML application, select the **SSO** tab
2. **IDP Entity ID** - auto-generated by JumpCloud, leave as is
3. **IDP URL** - auto-generated by JumpCloud, leave as is
4. **SP Entity ID** - enter the value from Tallyfy's "SP Entity ID" field
5. **ACS URL** - enter the value from Tallyfy's "SP ACS URL" field

    ![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/jumpcloud-sso-4.png)
6. **SAMLSubject NameID** - select **email** from the dropdown
7. **SAMLSubject NameID Format** - select **urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent**
8. Keep **Sign Assertion** checked (default)
9. Leave **Default RelayState** empty unless Tallyfy Support says otherwise
</Steps>

#### Step 3 - Configure attribute statements

JumpCloud needs to know which user info to send to Tallyfy. Add these three attributes:

<Steps>
1. Scroll to the **User Attribute Mapping** section
2. Click **add attribute** and configure the email attribute:
   - **Service Provider Attribute Name**: `email`
   - **JumpCloud Attribute Name**: Select `email`
3. Click **add attribute** again for the first name:
   - **Service Provider Attribute Name**: `FirstName`
   - **JumpCloud Attribute Name**: Select `firstname`
4. Click **add attribute** one more time for the last name:
   - **Service Provider Attribute Name**: `LastName`
   - **JumpCloud Attribute Name**: Select `lastname`

    ![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/jumpcloud-sso-5.png)
5. Click **Save**
</Steps>

These names are case-sensitive. Your mappings should look like this:

| Service Provider Attribute | JumpCloud Attribute |
|----------------------------|---------------------|
| email                      | email               |
| FirstName                  | firstname           |
| LastName                   | lastname            |

### Phase 3 - Configure Tallyfy with JumpCloud info

#### Step 1 - Get JumpCloud SAML metadata

<Steps>
1. In your JumpCloud SAML application, stay on the **SSO** tab
2. Find the **IDP Certificate Valid** section
3. Note these three values (you'll send them to Tallyfy Support):
   - **IDP Entity ID**
   - **IDP URL** (Single Sign-On URL)
   - **IDP Certificate** (X.509 Certificate)

    ![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/jumpcloud-sso-6.png)
4. Alternatively, click **export metadata** at the bottom of the SSO tab and save the XML file to send to Tallyfy Support instead
</Steps>

#### Step 2 - Send info to Tallyfy Support

<Steps>
1. Send the **IDP Entity ID**, **IDP URL**, and **X.509 Certificate** to Tallyfy Support (or send the metadata XML file)
2. Tallyfy Support will configure these values in your organization's SAML settings
3. Wait for confirmation that configuration is complete
</Steps>

#### Step 3 - Activate and assign users

Once Tallyfy Support confirms your settings are configured:

<Steps>
1. In JumpCloud, go to the **User Groups** tab in your Tallyfy application
2. Select the user groups or individual users who should access Tallyfy
3. Click **Save**
4. Toggle the application to **Active**

    ![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/jumpcloud-sso-7.png)
5. Coordinate with Tallyfy Support to toggle the SAML activation switch for your organization
</Steps>

### User provisioning and access

Once everything's configured:

<Steps>
1. Get the Tallyfy SSO login URL from Tallyfy Support
2. Share this URL with users assigned to the JumpCloud application
3. Users can also access Tallyfy through their JumpCloud user portal
</Steps>

What happens at login:
- **Existing Tallyfy account** - they're logged in automatically with JumpCloud credentials
- **No account yet** - Tallyfy creates one on first login using the email, first name, and last name from JumpCloud

### SSO authentication flow

```d2
Admin: Admin
JumpCloud: JumpCloud
Support: Tallyfy Support
Tallyfy: Tallyfy
User: User

# Setup Phase
Admin -> Support: 1. Request SSO
Support -> Admin: 2. Send SP config
Admin -> JumpCloud: 3. Create custom SAML app
Admin -> JumpCloud: 4. Enter SP details
Admin -> JumpCloud: 5. Map attributes
JumpCloud -> Admin: 6. Get IDP metadata
Admin -> Support: 7. Send metadata
Support -> Tallyfy: 8. Configure SSO
Admin -> JumpCloud: 9. Assign users
Support -> Admin: 10. Confirm ready
Admin -> Tallyfy: 11. Test login

# Authentication Phase
User -> Tallyfy: 12. Access Tallyfy
Tallyfy -> JumpCloud: 13. Redirect to IDP
User -> JumpCloud: 14. Enter credentials
JumpCloud -> JumpCloud: 15. Validate user
JumpCloud -> Tallyfy: 16. Send SAML assertion
Tallyfy -> Tallyfy: 17. Check or create user
Tallyfy -> User: 18. Grant access
```

- Steps 1-11 are the one-time setup between your Admin, JumpCloud, and Tallyfy Support
- Steps 12-18 happen every time a user logs in
- Tallyfy auto-creates accounts for new users (step 17) using email and name attributes from JumpCloud

### Troubleshooting

Can't log in? Check these first:
- Is the user assigned to the JumpCloud application?
- Are attribute mappings exact? Names are case-sensitive - `FirstName` not `firstname`
- Is the X.509 certificate still valid in JumpCloud?
- Are users going to the SSO URL or JumpCloud portal - not the regular Tallyfy login page?
- Is the application set to **Active** in JumpCloud?
- Still stuck? Contact Tallyfy Support.

### JumpCloud-specific notes

**Certificate management** - JumpCloud auto-generates and manages certificates when you activate an application. Monitor expiration dates in the JumpCloud Admin Portal.

**User portal access** - Users can access Tallyfy through their JumpCloud portal alongside other apps.

**Just-in-time provisioning** - User accounts in Tallyfy are created automatically on first SSO login. No manual provisioning or SCIM setup needed.

**Group-based access** - Control Tallyfy access by assigning JumpCloud user groups rather than individual users.
