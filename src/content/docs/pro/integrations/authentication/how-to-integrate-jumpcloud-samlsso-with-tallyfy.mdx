## JumpCloud SAML/SSO Integration

Connect JumpCloud with Tallyfy using SAML-based Single Sign-On (SSO) for automatic user authentication and account creation. Setup takes about 30 minutes.

:::caution[Coordination Required]
SSO setup requires exchanging configuration information between your organization and Tallyfy. You can't complete this process on your own. Submit a support ticket to get started.
:::

    ![Configure general information](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/jumpcloud-sso-3.png)
</Steps>

### Phase 2: Configure SAML settings

#### Step 1: Obtain Tallyfy SAML values

First, grab Tallyfy's service provider configuration - these tell JumpCloud where to send authentication information:

<Steps>
1. Contact Tallyfy Support to access your organization's profile
2. Navigate to the **Org Settings** tab
3. Click on **Add Configuration Details**
4. Locate the default SAML values section
5. You'll need these two values:
   - **SP ACS URL** (Assertion Consumer Service URL)
   - **SP Entity ID** (Service Provider Entity ID)
</Steps>

#### Step 2: Enter service provider details in JumpCloud

<Steps>
1. In your JumpCloud SAML application, select the **SSO** tab
2. **IDP Entity ID**: This is auto-generated by JumpCloud - leave as is
3. **IDP URL**: This is auto-generated by JumpCloud - leave as is
4. **SP Entity ID**: Enter the value from Tallyfy's "SP Entity ID" field
5. **ACS URL**: Enter the value from Tallyfy's "SP ACS URL" field

    ![Configure SP settings](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/jumpcloud-sso-4.png)
6. **SAMLSubject NameID**: Select **email** from the dropdown
7. **SAMLSubject NameID Format**: Select **urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:nameid-format:persistent**
8. Keep **Sign Assertion** checked (default)
9. Keep **Default RelayState** empty unless specified by Tallyfy Support
</Steps>

#### Step 3: Configure attribute statements

JumpCloud needs to know which user information to send to Tallyfy. Add these three attributes:

<Steps>
1. Scroll down to the **User Attribute Mapping** section
2. Click **add attribute** to add the first attribute
3. Configure the email attribute:
   - **Service Provider Attribute Name**: `email`
   - **JumpCloud Attribute Name**: Select `email` from dropdown
4. Click **add attribute** again for the first name
5. Configure the first name attribute:
   - **Service Provider Attribute Name**: `FirstName`
   - **JumpCloud Attribute Name**: Select `firstname` from dropdown
6. Click **add attribute** one more time for the last name
7. Configure the last name attribute:
   - **Service Provider Attribute Name**: `LastName`
   - **JumpCloud Attribute Name**: Select `lastname` from dropdown

    ![Attribute mapping configuration](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/jumpcloud-sso-5.png)
8. After adding all three attributes, click **Save**
</Steps>

Your attribute mappings should look like this:

| Service Provider Attribute | JumpCloud Attribute |
|----------------------------|---------------------|
| email                      | email               |
| FirstName                  | firstname           |
| LastName                   | lastname            |

### Phase 3: Configure Tallyfy with JumpCloud information

#### Step 1: Obtain JumpCloud SAML metadata

<Steps>
1. In your JumpCloud SAML application, stay on the **SSO** tab
2. Look for the **IDP Certificate Valid** section - this shows your X.509 certificate
3. Note down these three values (you'll send them to Tallyfy Support):
   - **IDP Entity ID** (Identity Provider Entity ID)
   - **IDP URL** (Identity Provider Single Sign-On URL)
   - **IDP Certificate** (X.509 Certificate)

    ![JumpCloud SAML metadata](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/jumpcloud-sso-6.png)
4. Alternatively, you can export the metadata XML file:
   - Click **export metadata** button at the bottom of the SSO tab
   - Save the XML file - you can send this entire file to Tallyfy Support
</Steps>

#### Step 2: Provide information to Tallyfy Support

<Steps>
1. Send the **IDP Entity ID** to Tallyfy Support
2. Send the **IDP URL** to Tallyfy Support
3. Send the **X.509 Certificate** to Tallyfy Support (or send the metadata XML file)
4. Tallyfy Support will configure these values in your organization's SAML settings
5. Wait for confirmation from Tallyfy Support that configuration is complete
</Steps>

#### Step 3: Activate and assign users

Once Tallyfy Support confirms your settings are configured:

<Steps>
1. In JumpCloud, navigate to the **User Groups** tab in your Tallyfy application
2. Select the user groups or individual users who should have access to Tallyfy
3. Click **Save**
4. Toggle the application to **Active** status

    ![Activate application](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/jumpcloud-sso-7.png)
5. In Tallyfy (coordinating with Support), toggle the SAML activation switch to enable SSO for your organization
</Steps>

### User provisioning and access

Once everything's configured:

<Steps>
1. Get the Tallyfy SSO login URL from Tallyfy Support
2. Share this URL with your users who have been assigned to the JumpCloud application
3. Optionally, users can also access Tallyfy through their JumpCloud user portal
</Steps>

Here's what happens for your users:
- Already have a Tallyfy account? They'll log in automatically using their JumpCloud credentials
- Don't have an account yet? Tallyfy creates one on their first login using the attributes from JumpCloud

### SSO authentication flow

This shows the complete authentication process from setup to user access.

```d2
Admin: Admin
JumpCloud: JumpCloud
Support: Tallyfy Support
Tallyfy: Tallyfy
User: User

# Setup Phase
Admin -> Support: 1. Request SSO
Support -> Admin: 2. Send SP config
Admin -> JumpCloud: 3. Create custom SAML app
Admin -> JumpCloud: 4. Enter SP details
Admin -> JumpCloud: 5. Map attributes
JumpCloud -> Admin: 6. Get IDP metadata
Admin -> Support: 7. Send metadata
Support -> Tallyfy: 8. Configure SSO
Admin -> JumpCloud: 9. Assign users
Support -> Admin: 10. Confirm ready
Admin -> Tallyfy: 11. Test login

# Authentication Phase
User -> Tallyfy: 12. Access Tallyfy
Tallyfy -> JumpCloud: 13. Redirect to IDP
User -> JumpCloud: 14. Enter credentials
JumpCloud -> JumpCloud: 15. Validate user
JumpCloud -> Tallyfy: 16. Send SAML assertion
Tallyfy -> Tallyfy: 17. Check or create user
Tallyfy -> User: 18. Grant access
```

**What to notice:**
- Steps 1-11 show the one-time setup collaboration between your Admin, JumpCloud, and Tallyfy Support
- Steps 12-18 demonstrate the actual user authentication flow that happens every login
- Tallyfy automatically creates accounts for new users (step 17) using the email and name attributes from JumpCloud
- Users can access Tallyfy either through the SSO URL or through their JumpCloud user portal

### Troubleshooting

Can't log in? Check these things first:
- Is the user assigned to the JumpCloud application?
- Are the attribute mappings exact? (names and formats are case-sensitive)
- Is the X.509 certificate still valid in JumpCloud?
- Are users using the SSO URL or JumpCloud portal - not the regular Tallyfy login page?
- Is the application status set to **Active** in JumpCloud?
- Still stuck? Contact Tallyfy Support

### JumpCloud-specific notes

JumpCloud has some unique characteristics compared to other identity providers:

**Certificate management**: JumpCloud automatically generates and manages certificates for you when you activate an application. These certificates are automatically renewed, but you should monitor their expiration dates in the JumpCloud Admin Portal.

**User portal access**: Once configured, users can access Tallyfy through their JumpCloud user portal alongside other applications, creating a unified access point for all company tools.

**Just-in-time provisioning**: JumpCloud supports JIT provisioning, which means user accounts in Tallyfy are created automatically on first login without requiring manual provisioning or SCIM integration.

**Group-based access**: You can control Tallyfy access by assigning JumpCloud user groups rather than individual users, making it easier to manage access for teams and departments.
