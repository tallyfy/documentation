## Google Workspace SAML/SSO Integration

Connect Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) and Tallyfy with SAML-based Single Sign-On. Your users can authenticate automatically with their Google credentials - no separate passwords needed.

:::caution[Coordination Required]
SSO setup requires exchanging configuration information between your organization and Tallyfy. You can't complete this process on your own. Submit a support ticket to get started.
:::

### Requirements

- Google Workspace administrator account with super-administrator privileges
- Tallyfy Professional or Enterprise plan
- SAML configuration values from Tallyfy Support

### Implementation process overview

You'll work through three main phases:

### Phase 1: Create Google Workspace custom SAML application

#### Step 1: Create a custom SAML application

<Steps>
1. Sign in to the [Google Workspace Admin console](https://admin.google.com/)
2. Navigate to **Apps** > **Web and mobile apps**
3. Click **Add App** > **Add custom SAML app**

</Steps>

#### Step 2: Configure basic app settings

<Steps>
1. Enter "Tallyfy" as the application name
2. Optionally upload the Tallyfy logo
3. Click **Continue** to proceed to the next step
</Steps>

#### Step 3: Obtain Google Identity Provider details

<Steps>
1. On the **Google Identity Provider details** page, collect the **SSO URL** (Single Sign-On URL).
2. Collect the **Entity ID** (Issuer).
3. Download the **Certificate** file.

</Steps>

#### Step 4: Configure Service Provider details

<Steps>
1. Enter the Tallyfy **ACS URL** (Assertion Consumer Service URL) provided by Tallyfy Support.
2. Enter the Tallyfy **Entity ID** (Service Provider Entity ID) provided by Tallyfy Support.
3. Leave the **Start URL** field empty.

</Steps>

#### Step 5: Configure attribute mapping

Map these user attributes exactly as shown:

| Google Directory Attribute | App Attribute |
|----------------------------|--------------|
| Primary Email | email |
| First Name | firstName |
| Last Name | lastName |

Click **Finish**. That's it for the Google side.

#### Step 6: Enable user access

<Steps>
1. In the application settings, go to **User Access**
2. Set the **Service status** to **ON for everyone** (or select specific organizational units)

</Steps>

### Phase 2: Configure SAML settings

### Phase 3: Complete integration with Tallyfy

#### Step 1: Submit SAML information to Tallyfy

<Steps>
1. Provide the collected **SSO URL** to Tallyfy Support.
2. Provide the collected **Entity ID** to Tallyfy Support.
3. Provide the downloaded **Certificate file** to Tallyfy Support.
</Steps>

#### Step 2: Configure SAML settings in Tallyfy

<Steps>
1. Once Tallyfy Support has processed your information, navigate to your organization settings
2. Locate the SAML configuration section
3. Enter the configuration details as provided by Tallyfy Support

    ![Tallyfy SAML Configuration](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy/pro/google-sso-saml-config.png)
</Steps>

#### Step 3: Enable SAML authentication

<Steps>
1. Toggle the SAML activation switch to enable SSO for your organization

</Steps>

### User provisioning and access

After you complete the integration:

<Steps>
1. Share the Tallyfy login URL with your users (you'll find it in the SAML configuration modal).

    ![Tallyfy Login URL](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy/pro/google-sso-login-url.png)
2. Make sure users who need access have been granted access to the SAML app in Google Workspace.
3. Existing Tallyfy users can sign in through the shared SSO URL - no separate Tallyfy passwords required.
4. New users? They'll be automatically provisioned in Tallyfy on their first SSO login.
</Steps>

### How the authentication flow works

This shows the complete SAML authentication flow after configuration is complete.

```d2
User: User
Tallyfy: Tallyfy
Google: Google Workspace IdP

# Authentication Flow
User -> Tallyfy: 1. Access SSO URL
Tallyfy -> Google: 2. Redirect with SAML
Google -> User: 3. Show login page
User -> Google: 4. Enter credentials
Google -> Google: 5. Validate

# Decision point for authentication success
AuthCheck: Auth OK? {
  shape: diamond
}

Google -> AuthCheck: 6. Check result

# Success path
AuthCheck -> Google: Yes
Google -> Tallyfy: 7. SAML Response

# User provisioning check
UserCheck: User Exists? {
  shape: diamond
}

Tallyfy -> UserCheck: 8. Check email

# New user provisioning
UserCheck -> Tallyfy: No
NewUser: 9a. Create account
Tallyfy -> NewUser
NewUser -> Session: 10a. Create session

# Existing user path
UserCheck -> Tallyfy: Yes
ExistingUser: 9b. Match user
Tallyfy -> ExistingUser
ExistingUser -> Session: 10b. Create session

# Grant access
Session: Session Created
Session -> User: 11. Grant access

# Failure path
AuthCheck -> Google: No
Google -> User: 12. Auth failed
```

**What to notice:**
- **Automatic user provisioning** - New users are created automatically on first login (step 9a), eliminating manual account setup
- **SAML attribute mapping** - The email, firstName, and lastName attributes configured earlier (step 7) determine how user accounts are created and matched
- **Single authentication point** - Users authenticate only with Google (step 4-5), never entering Tallyfy passwords

### Troubleshooting

Running into authentication problems? Here's what to check:
- Has the user been granted access to the SAML app in Google Workspace?
- Are the attribute mappings set up correctly? (Double-check the table above)
- Is the user accessing Tallyfy through the right SSO URL?
- Still stuck? Contact Tallyfy Support for help
