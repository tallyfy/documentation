## Google Workspace SAML/SSO Integration

This guide explains how to set up SAML-based Single Sign-On (SSO) between Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) and Tallyfy to enable seamless authentication and automated user provisioning.

:::caution[Coordination Required]
SSO setup requires exchanging configuration information between your organization and Tallyfy. This process cannot be completed independently. Please submit a support ticket to initiate the integration process.
:::

### Requirements

- Google Workspace administrator account with super-administrator privileges
- Tallyfy Professional or Enterprise plan
- SAML configuration values from Tallyfy Support

### Google Workspace Configuration

#### Step 1: Create a Custom SAML Application

<Steps>
1. Sign in to the [Google Workspace Admin console](https://admin.google.com/)
2. Navigate to **Apps** > **Web and mobile apps**

#### Step 5: Configure Attribute Mapping

Map the following user attributes:

| Google Directory Attribute | App Attribute |
|----------------------------|--------------|
| Primary Email | email |
| First Name | firstName |
| Last Name | lastName |

Click **Finish** to complete the application setup.

#### Step 6: Enable User Access

<Steps>
1. In the application settings, go to **User Access**
2. Set the **Service status** to **ON for everyone** (or select specific organizational units)
</Steps>

### Tallyfy Configuration

#### Step 1: Submit SAML Information to Tallyfy

<Steps>
1. Provide Tallyfy Support with the Google Identity Provider details:
- SSO URL
- Entity ID
- Certificate file
</Steps>

#### Step 2: Configure SAML Settings in Tallyfy

<Steps>
1. Once Tallyfy Support has processed your information, navigate to your organization settings
2. Locate the SAML configuration section
3. Enter the configuration details as provided by Tallyfy Support
</Steps>

### User Provisioning and Access

Once the integration is complete:

<Steps>
1. Share the Tallyfy login URL with your users (available in the SAML configuration modal)

2. Users with access to the Google SAML app can now:
   - Existing users: Sign in without requiring separate Tallyfy credentials
   - New users: Be automatically provisioned in Tallyfy upon first login
</Steps>

### Troubleshooting

If users encounter authentication issues:
- Verify the user has been granted access to the SAML app in Google Workspace
- Ensure attribute mappings are correctly configured
- Check that the user is accessing Tallyfy through the proper SSO URL
- Contact Tallyfy Support for assistance with persistent issues
