## Google Workspace SAML/SSO Integration

This guide explains how to set up SAML-based Single Sign-On (SSO) between Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) and Tallyfy to enable automated user authentication and provisioning.

:::caution[Coordination Required]
SSO setup requires exchanging configuration information between your organization and Tallyfy. This process cannot be completed independently. Please submit a support ticket to initiate the integration process.
:::

### Requirements

- Google Workspace administrator account with super-administrator privileges
- Tallyfy Professional or Enterprise plan
- SAML configuration values from Tallyfy Support

### Implementation process overview

The integration involves three main phases:

### Phase 1: Create Google Workspace custom SAML application

#### Step 1: Create a custom SAML application

<Steps>
1. Sign in to the [Google Workspace Admin console](https://admin.google.com/)
2. Navigate to **Apps** > **Web and mobile apps**
3. Click **Add App** > **Add custom SAML app**
</Steps>

#### Step 2: Configure basic app settings

<Steps>
1. Enter "Tallyfy" as the application name
2. Optionally upload the Tallyfy logo
3. Click **Continue** to proceed to the next step
</Steps>

#### Step 3: Obtain Google Identity Provider details

<Steps>
1. On the **Google Identity Provider details** page, collect the **SSO URL** (Single Sign-On URL).
2. Collect the **Entity ID** (Issuer).
3. Download the **Certificate** file.
</Steps>

#### Step 4: Configure Service Provider details

<Steps>
1. Enter the Tallyfy **ACS URL** (Assertion Consumer Service URL) provided by Tallyfy Support.
2. Enter the Tallyfy **Entity ID** (Service Provider Entity ID) provided by Tallyfy Support.
3. Leave the **Start URL** field empty.
</Steps>

#### Step 5: Configure attribute mapping

Map the following user attributes:

| Google Directory Attribute | App Attribute |
|----------------------------|--------------|
| Primary Email | email |
| First Name | firstName |
| Last Name | lastName |

Click **Finish** to complete the application setup.

#### Step 6: Enable user access

<Steps>
1. In the application settings, go to **User Access**
2. Set the **Service status** to **ON for everyone** (or select specific organizational units)
</Steps>

### Phase 2: Configure SAML settings

### Phase 3: Complete integration with Tallyfy

#### Step 1: Submit SAML information to Tallyfy

<Steps>
1. Provide the collected **SSO URL** to Tallyfy Support.
2. Provide the collected **Entity ID** to Tallyfy Support.
3. Provide the downloaded **Certificate file** to Tallyfy Support.
</Steps>

#### Step 2: Configure SAML settings in Tallyfy

<Steps>
1. Once Tallyfy Support has processed your information, navigate to your organization settings
2. Locate the SAML configuration section
3. Enter the configuration details as provided by Tallyfy Support
</Steps>

#### Step 3: Enable SAML authentication

<Steps>
1. Toggle the SAML activation switch to enable SSO for your organization
</Steps>

### User provisioning and access

Once the integration is complete:

<Steps>
1. Share the Tallyfy login URL with your users (available in the SAML configuration modal).
   ![Tallyfy Login URL](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9307582/118475633-652afb80-b704-11eb-961c-63db58bc7f42.png)
2. Ensure users who need access have been granted access to the SAML app in Google Workspace.
3. Existing Tallyfy users can now sign in via the shared SSO URL without requiring separate Tallyfy credentials.
4. New users will be automatically provisioned in Tallyfy upon their first login via the shared SSO URL.
</Steps>

### Troubleshooting

If users encounter authentication issues:
- Verify the user has been granted access to the SAML app in Google Workspace
- Ensure attribute mappings are correctly configured
- Check that the user is accessing Tallyfy through the proper SSO URL
- Contact Tallyfy Support for assistance with persistent issues
