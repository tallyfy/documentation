## Google Workspace SAML/SSO Integration

Connect Google Workspace (formerly G Suite) and Tallyfy with SAML-based Single Sign-On. Your users can authenticate automatically with their Google credentials - no separate passwords needed.

:::caution[Coordination Required]
SSO setup requires exchanging configuration information between your organization and Tallyfy. You can't complete this process on your own. Submit a support ticket to get started.
:::

### Requirements

- Google Workspace administrator account with super-administrator privileges
- Tallyfy Professional or Enterprise plan
- SAML configuration values from Tallyfy Support

### Implementation process overview

You'll work through three main phases:

### Phase 1: Create Google Workspace custom SAML application

#### Step 1: Create a custom SAML application

<Steps>
1. Sign in to the [Google Workspace Admin console](https://admin.google.com/)
2. Navigate to **Apps** > **Web and mobile apps**
3. Click **Add App** > **Add custom SAML app**

</Steps>

#### Step 2: Configure basic app settings

<Steps>
1. Enter "Tallyfy" as the application name
2. Optionally upload the Tallyfy logo
3. Click **Continue** to proceed to the next step
</Steps>

#### Step 3: Obtain Google Identity Provider details

<Steps>
1. On the **Google Identity Provider details** page, collect the **SSO URL** (Single Sign-On URL).
2. Collect the **Entity ID** (Issuer).
3. Download the **Certificate** file.

</Steps>

#### Step 4: Configure Service Provider details

<Steps>
1. Enter the Tallyfy **ACS URL** (Assertion Consumer Service URL) provided by Tallyfy Support.
2. Enter the Tallyfy **Entity ID** (Service Provider Entity ID) provided by Tallyfy Support.
3. Leave the **Start URL** field empty.

</Steps>

#### Step 5: Configure attribute mapping

Map these user attributes exactly as shown:

| Google Directory Attribute | App Attribute |
|----------------------------|--------------|
| Primary Email | email |
| First Name | firstName |
| Last Name | lastName |

Click **Finish**. That's it for the Google side.

#### Step 6: Enable user access

<Steps>
1. In the application settings, go to **User Access**
2. Set the **Service status** to **ON for everyone** (or select specific organizational units)

</Steps>

### Phase 2: Configure SAML settings

### Phase 3: Complete integration with Tallyfy

#### Step 1: Submit SAML information to Tallyfy

<Steps>
1. Provide the collected **SSO URL** to Tallyfy Support.
2. Provide the collected **Entity ID** to Tallyfy Support.
3. Provide the downloaded **Certificate file** to Tallyfy Support.
</Steps>

#### Step 2: Configure SAML settings in Tallyfy

<Steps>
1. Once Tallyfy Support has processed your information, navigate to your organization settings
2. Locate the SAML configuration section
3. Enter the configuration details as provided by Tallyfy Support

    ![Tallyfy SAML Configuration](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9307582/111089170-f3c7a480-852a-11eb-97aa-6034327bbea5.png)
</Steps>

#### Step 3: Enable SAML authentication

<Steps>
1. Toggle the SAML activation switch to enable SSO for your organization

</Steps>

### User provisioning and access

After you complete the integration:

<Steps>
1. Share the Tallyfy login URL with your users (you'll find it in the SAML configuration modal).

2. Make sure users who need access have been granted access to the SAML app in Google Workspace.
3. Existing Tallyfy users can sign in through the shared SSO URL - no separate Tallyfy passwords required.
4. New users? They'll be automatically provisioned in Tallyfy on their first SSO login.
</Steps>

### Troubleshooting

Running into authentication problems? Here's what to check:
- Has the user been granted access to the SAML app in Google Workspace?
- Are the attribute mappings set up correctly? (Double-check the table above)
- Is the user accessing Tallyfy through the right SSO URL?
- Still stuck? Contact Tallyfy Support for help
