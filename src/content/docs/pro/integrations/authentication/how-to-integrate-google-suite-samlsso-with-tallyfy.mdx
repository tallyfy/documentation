Now that your Google Suite SAML application is set up, let's configure SAML on Tallyfy:

1. Copy the SAML data from the **Google Identity Provider details** page in your SAML app.
2. Go to the Tallyfy Support page and fill in the SAML configs using the values you copied. This step may require Tallyfy Support assistance.

Congratulations! Single Sign-On and User Provisioning using Google Suite will now be available for your organization's users in Tallyfy.

To provision new members to Tallyfy using SSO, simply share the **Tallyfy login URL** from the SAML configs modal with your users who have access to the Google Suite SAML app.
