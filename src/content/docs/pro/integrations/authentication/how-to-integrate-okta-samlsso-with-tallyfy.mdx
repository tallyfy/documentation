## Okta SAML/SSO Integration

This guide explains how to configure SAML-based Single Sign-On (SSO) between Okta and Tallyfy to enable automated user authentication and provisioning.

:::caution[Coordination Required]
SSO setup requires exchanging configuration information between your organization and Tallyfy. This process cannot be completed independently. Please submit a support ticket to initiate the integration process.
:::

### Requirements

- Okta administrator account
- Tallyfy Professional or Enterprise plan
- SAML configuration values from Tallyfy Support

### Implementation process overview

The integration involves three main phases:
1. Creating and configuring an Okta SAML application
2. Configuring SAML settings in both systems
3. Enabling and testing the SSO integration

### Phase 1: Create Okta SAML application

#### Step 1: Access application management

3. The page will display the SAML configuration details for the identity provider
</Steps>

#### Step 2: Provide information to Tallyfy Support

<Steps>
1. Send the **Identity Provider Single Sign-On URL** to Tallyfy Support.
2. Send the **Identity Provider Issuer** to Tallyfy Support.
3. Send the **X.509 Certificate** to Tallyfy Support.
4. Tallyfy Support will configure these values in your organization's SAML settings.
</Steps>

#### Step 3: Enable SAML authentication

Once Tallyfy Support has configured your SAML settings:

<Steps>
1. Toggle the SAML activation switch to enable SSO for your organization
</Steps>

### User provisioning and access

After completing the integration:

<Steps>
1. Obtain the Tallyfy login URL from the SAML configuration modal (provided by Tallyfy Support)
2. Share this URL with your users who have access to the Okta application
</Steps>

Users can now access Tallyfy through this URL:
- Existing Tallyfy users will be automatically authenticated
- New users will be provisioned in Tallyfy upon their first login

### Troubleshooting

If users encounter authentication issues:
- Verify the user has been assigned to the Okta application
- Check that attribute mappings are correctly configured (exact names and formats)
- Ensure users are accessing Tallyfy through the SSO URL
- Contact Tallyfy Support for assistance with persistent issues
