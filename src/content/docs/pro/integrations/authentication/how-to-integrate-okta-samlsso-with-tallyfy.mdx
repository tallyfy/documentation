## Okta SAML/SSO Integration

Want to connect Okta with Tallyfy? You'll be setting up SAML-based Single Sign-On (SSO) that handles user authentication and creates accounts automatically. Takes about 30 minutes.

:::caution[Coordination Required]
SSO setup requires exchanging configuration information between your organization and Tallyfy. You can't complete this process on your own. Submit a support ticket to get started.
:::

### Requirements

- Okta administrator account
- Tallyfy Professional or Enterprise plan
- SAML configuration values from Tallyfy Support

### Implementation process overview

Here's what you'll do:
1. Create an Okta SAML application
2. Configure settings in both systems  
3. Turn on SSO and test it works

### Phase 1: Create Okta SAML application

#### Step 1: Access application management

<Steps>
1. Sign in to the Okta Admin Console
2. Switch to Classic UI from the dropdown in the top left header

</Steps>

#### Step 2: Configure general settings

<Steps>
1. Enter "Tallyfy" as the application name
2. Optionally upload the Tallyfy logo
3. Click **Next**
</Steps>

### Phase 2: Configure SAML settings

#### Step 1: Obtain Tallyfy SAML values

First, you'll need to grab Tallyfy's SAML values - these tell Okta where to send login information:

<Steps>
1. Contact Tallyfy Support to access your organization's profile
2. Navigate to the **Org Settings** tab
3. Click on **Add Configuration Details**
4. Locate the default SAML values section
</Steps>

#### Step 2: Enter SAML settings in Okta

Time to configure Okta with those values you just got:

<Steps>
1. **Single Sign On URL**: Enter the value from Tallyfy's "SP ACS URL" field
2. Keep **Use this for Recipient URL and Destination URL** checkbox selected
3. **Audience URI (SP Entity ID)**: Enter the value from Tallyfy's "SP Entity ID" field

    ![SAML settings configuration](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/oktasso-8.png)
4. Click **Show Advanced Settings**
5. Change **Authentication context class** to **X.509 Certificate**
</Steps>

#### Step 3: Configure attribute statements

Next, tell Okta which user information to send to Tallyfy:

| Name | Name Format | Value |
|------|-------------|-------|
| email | Unspecified | user.email |
| FirstName | Unspecified | user.firstName |
| LastName | Unspecified | user.lastName |

![Attribute statements configuration](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/oktasso-10.png)

<Steps>
1. After adding the attributes, click **Next**.
</Steps>

#### Step 4: Complete Okta configuration

<Steps>
1. Select **I'm an Okta customer adding an internal app**
2. Check **This is an internal app that we have created**
3. Click **Finish**
</Steps>

### Phase 3: Configure Tallyfy with Okta information

#### Step 1: Obtain Okta SAML information

<Steps>
1. Navigate to the **Sign On** tab in your Okta application

    ![Sign On tab](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/oktasso-12.png)
2. Scroll down and click **View Setup Instructions**

    ![View Setup Instructions](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/oktasso-13.png)
3. The page will display the SAML configuration details for the identity provider
</Steps>

#### Step 2: Provide information to Tallyfy Support

<Steps>
1. Send the **Identity Provider Single Sign-On URL** to Tallyfy Support.
2. Send the **Identity Provider Issuer** to Tallyfy Support.
3. Send the **X.509 Certificate** to Tallyfy Support.
4. Tallyfy Support will configure these values in your organization's SAML settings.
</Steps>

#### Step 3: Enable SAML authentication

After Tallyfy Support confirms they've configured your settings:

<Steps>
1. Toggle the SAML activation switch to enable SSO for your organization
</Steps>

### User provisioning and access

Once everything's set up:

<Steps>
1. Get the Tallyfy login URL from the SAML configuration modal (Tallyfy Support provides this)
2. Share this URL with your users who have access to the Okta application
</Steps>

Here's how it works for your users:
- Already have a Tallyfy account? They'll log in automatically
- Don't have an account yet? Tallyfy creates one on their first login

### SSO authentication flow

This shows the complete authentication process from setup to user access.

```d2
Admin: Admin
Okta: Okta
Support: Tallyfy Support
Tallyfy: Tallyfy
User: User

# Setup Phase
Admin -> Okta: 1. Create app
Okta -> Admin: 2. Get metadata
Admin -> Support: 3. Send metadata
Support -> Tallyfy: 4. Configure SSO
Support -> Admin: 5. Provide settings
Admin -> Tallyfy: 6. Test connection

# Authentication Phase
User -> Okta: 7. Click login
Okta -> User: 8. Show login form
User -> Okta: 9. Enter credentials
Okta -> Okta: 10. Validate
Okta -> Tallyfy: 11. Send SAML assertion
Tallyfy -> Tallyfy: 12. Check user exists
Tallyfy -> Tallyfy: 13. Create or match user
Tallyfy -> User: 14. Grant access
```

**What to notice:**
- Steps 1-6 show the one-time setup collaboration between your Admin and Tallyfy Support
- Steps 7-14 demonstrate the actual user authentication flow that happens every login
- Tallyfy automatically creates accounts for new users (step 13) using the email and name attributes from Okta

### Troubleshooting

Can't log in? Check these things first:
- Is the user assigned to the Okta application?
- Are the attribute mappings exactly right? (names and formats matter)
- Are users using the SSO URL - not the regular Tallyfy login page?
- Still stuck? Contact Tallyfy Support
