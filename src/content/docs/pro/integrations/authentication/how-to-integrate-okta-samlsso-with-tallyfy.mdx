## Okta SAML/SSO integration

Connect Okta with Tallyfy using SAML-based Single Sign-On (SSO) for automatic authentication and user provisioning. Takes about 30 minutes.

:::caution[Coordination required]
SSO setup requires exchanging config between your organization and Tallyfy. You can't do this alone - submit a support ticket to get started.
:::

### Requirements

- Okta administrator account
- Tallyfy Professional or Enterprise plan
- SAML configuration values from Tallyfy Support

### Setup overview

1. Create an Okta SAML application
2. Configure settings in both systems
3. Turn on SSO and test it

### Phase 1: Create Okta SAML application

#### Step 1: Create a new app

1. Enter "Tallyfy" as the application name
2. Optionally upload the Tallyfy logo
3. Click **Next**
</Steps>

### Phase 2: Configure SAML settings

#### Step 1: Obtain Tallyfy SAML values

Grab Tallyfy's SAML values first - these tell Okta where to send login data:

<Steps>
1. Contact Tallyfy Support to access your organization's profile
2. Go to the **Org Settings** tab
3. Click **Add Configuration Details**
4. Find the default SAML values section
</Steps>

#### Step 2: Enter SAML settings in Okta

Now configure Okta with those values:

<Steps>
1. **Single Sign On URL**: Enter the value from Tallyfy's "SP ACS URL" field
2. Keep **Use this for Recipient URL and Destination URL** checkbox selected
3. **Audience URI (SP Entity ID)**: Enter the value from Tallyfy's "SP Entity ID" field

    ![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/oktasso-8.png)
4. Click **Show Advanced Settings**
5. Change **Authentication context class** to **X.509 Certificate**
</Steps>

#### Step 3: Configure attribute statements

Tell Okta which user info to send to Tallyfy:

| Name | Name Format | Value |
|------|-------------|-------|
| email | Unspecified | user.email |
| FirstName | Unspecified | user.firstName |
| LastName | Unspecified | user.lastName |

![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/oktasso-10.png)

<Steps>
1. After adding the attributes, click **Next**
</Steps>

#### Step 4: Complete Okta configuration

<Steps>
1. Select **I'm an Okta customer adding an internal app**
2. Check **This is an internal app that we have created**
3. Click **Finish**
</Steps>

### Phase 3: Configure Tallyfy with Okta info

#### Step 1: Get Okta SAML details

<Steps>
1. Go to the **Sign On** tab in your Okta application

2. Scroll down and click **View Setup Instructions**

    ![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/oktasso-13.png)
3. The page shows the identity provider's SAML config details
</Steps>

#### Step 2: Send details to Tallyfy Support

<Steps>
1. Send the **Identity Provider Single Sign-On URL** to Tallyfy Support
2. Send the **Identity Provider Issuer** to Tallyfy Support
3. Send the **X.509 Certificate** to Tallyfy Support
4. Tallyfy Support configures these values in your organization's SAML settings
</Steps>

#### Step 3: Enable SAML authentication

After Tallyfy Support confirms your settings are configured:

<Steps>
1. Toggle the SAML activation switch to enable SSO for your organization
</Steps>

### User provisioning and access

Once SSO is active:

<Steps>
1. Get the Tallyfy login URL from the SAML configuration modal (Tallyfy Support provides this)
2. Share this URL with users who have access to the Okta application
</Steps>

How it works for your users:
- Already have a Tallyfy account? They log in automatically
- No account yet? Tallyfy creates one on their first login

### SSO authentication flow

The full authentication process from setup to user access:

```d2
Admin: Admin
Okta: Okta
Support: Tallyfy Support
Tallyfy: Tallyfy
User: User

# Setup Phase
Admin -> Okta: 1. Create app
Okta -> Admin: 2. Get metadata
Admin -> Support: 3. Send metadata
Support -> Tallyfy: 4. Configure SSO
Support -> Admin: 5. Provide settings
Admin -> Tallyfy: 6. Test connection

# Authentication Phase
User -> Okta: 7. Click login
Okta -> User: 8. Show login form
User -> Okta: 9. Enter credentials
Okta -> Okta: 10. Validate
Okta -> Tallyfy: 11. Send SAML assertion
Tallyfy -> Tallyfy: 12. Check user exists
Tallyfy -> Tallyfy: 13. Create or match user
Tallyfy -> User: 14. Grant access
```

**Key points:**
- Steps 1-6 are the one-time setup between your Admin and Tallyfy Support
- Steps 7-14 happen every time a user logs in
- Tallyfy auto-creates accounts for new users (step 13) using the email and name attributes from Okta

### Troubleshooting

Can't log in? Check these first:
- Is the user assigned to the Okta application?
- Are attribute mappings exactly right? Names and formats matter.
- Are users hitting the SSO URL, not the regular Tallyfy login page?
- Still stuck? Contact Tallyfy Support.
