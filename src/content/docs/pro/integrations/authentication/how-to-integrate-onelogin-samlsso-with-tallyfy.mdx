## OneLogin SAML/SSO Integration

Want your team to access Tallyfy with their OneLogin credentials? You'll set up SAML-based Single Sign-On (SSO) to handle authentication automatically. Takes about 30 minutes.

:::caution[Coordination Required]
SSO setup requires exchanging configuration information between your organization and Tallyfy. This process cannot be completed independently. Please submit a support ticket to initiate the integration process.
:::

### Requirements

- OneLogin administrator account
- Tallyfy Professional or Enterprise plan
- SAML configuration values from Tallyfy Support

### Implementation process overview

Here's what you'll do:
1. Create a OneLogin SAML application connector
2. Configure SAML settings in both systems
3. Enable and test the SSO integration

## SAML Integration Flow

This diagram shows the complete OneLogin-Tallyfy SAML setup and authentication flow.

```d2
Admin: "Admin"
OneLogin: "OneLogin"
TSupport: "TSupport"
Tallyfy: "Tallyfy"
User: "User"
Admin: Admin
OneLogin: OneLogin
TSupport: Tallyfy Support
Tallyfy: Tallyfy
User: User

# Setup Phase
Admin -> OneLogin: "1. Create SAML Test Connector app"
Admin -> OneLogin: "2. Name it 'Tallyfy'"

Admin -> TSupport: "3. Request SAML configuration values"
TSupport -> Admin: "4. Provide SP ACS URL, SP Entity ID"

Admin -> OneLogin: "5. Configure with Tallyfy values\n- ACS URL\n- Entity ID\n- Parameters (Email, FirstName, LastName)"

Admin -> OneLogin: "6. Assign users/roles to app"

OneLogin -> Admin: "7. Provide SAML metadata\n- SAML 2.0 Endpoint\n- Issuer URL\n- X.509 Certificate"

Admin -> TSupport: "8. Send OneLogin metadata"
TSupport -> Tallyfy: "9. Configure SAML settings"
TSupport -> Admin: "10. Confirm configuration complete"

Admin -> Tallyfy: "11. Enable SAML toggle"
Tallyfy -> Admin: "12. Provide SSO login URL"

# Runtime Authentication Flow
User -> Tallyfy: "13. Access via SSO URL"
Tallyfy -> OneLogin: "14. Redirect for authentication"
User -> OneLogin: "15. Enter credentials"
OneLogin -> OneLogin: "16. Validate user"
OneLogin -> Tallyfy: "17. SAML assertion with user attributes"

# Branching logic for Existing vs New user
Existing user: {
  shape: rectangle
  style.stroke-dash: 3
  Tallyfy -> User: "18a. Grant immediate access"
}

New user: {
  shape: rectangle
  style.stroke-dash: 3
  Tallyfy -> Tallyfy: "18b. Auto-provision account"
  Tallyfy -> User: "19b. Grant access to new account"
}
```

### What to notice:
- Configuration requires exchanging metadata between OneLogin and Tallyfy Support
- Users access through a special SSO URL after setup is complete
- New users are automatically provisioned on first login

### Phase 1: Create OneLogin SAML application

#### Step 1: Access application management

<Steps>
1. Sign in to your OneLogin portal
2. Open the **Administration** menu
3. Navigate to **Applications > Applications**
4. Click **Add App**

    ![Add Application button](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/onelogin-1.png)
</Steps>

#### Step 2: Select and configure the connector

<Steps>
1. Search for "SAML Test Connector"
2. Select **SAML Test Connector (Advanced)**
3. Edit the **Display Name** to "Tallyfy"
4. Click **Save**

    ![SAML Connector configuration](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/onelogin-2.png)
</Steps>

### Phase 2: Configure SAML settings

#### Step 1: Obtain Tallyfy SAML values

You'll need Tallyfy's default SAML values to configure OneLogin properly:

<Steps>
1. Contact Tallyfy Support to access your organization's profile
2. Navigate to the **Org Settings** tab
3. Click **Add Configuration Details**
4. Locate the default SAML values section

    ![Tallyfy organization settings](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/onelogin-3.png)
    ![Tallyfy default SAML values](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/onelogin-4.png)
</Steps>

#### Step 2: Configure the OneLogin connector

<Steps>
1. Navigate to the **Configuration** tab in your OneLogin application connector.
2. Enter the Tallyfy **SP ACS URL** into the **ACS (Consumer) URL** field.
3. Enter the same URL into the **Recipient** field.
4. Enter the Tallyfy **SP Entity ID** into the **Audience (EntityID)** field.
5. Enter the ACS URL again into the **ACS (Consumer) URL Validator** field.
6. Click **Save**.

</Steps>

#### Step 3: Configure user attributes

<Steps>
1. Navigate to the **Parameters** tab in your OneLogin application.
2. Add the three parameters detailed below.
</Steps>

Add these three parameters - and don't forget to check the **Include in SAML assertion** box for each one:

| Parameter Name | Value |
|---------------|-------|
| Email | Email |
| FirstName | First Name |
| LastName | Last Name |

![Parameters configuration](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/onelogin-6.png)

Here's how to add each parameter:

1. Click the **+** button in the top-right corner of the parameters table.
2. Enter the parameter name (e.g., "Email") and map it to the corresponding user attribute (Value field).
3. Check the **Include in SAML assertion** box.
4. Click **Save**.

    ![Parameter configuration example 2](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/onelogin-8.png)

#### Step 4: Assign users to the application

<Steps>
1. Navigate to the **Access** tab in your OneLogin application
2. Configure user access by selecting appropriate roles or users
3. In this example, we're using the **Default** role to grant access
4. Click **Save**

    ![User access configuration](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/onelogin-9.png)
</Steps>

### Phase 3: Configure Tallyfy with OneLogin information

#### Step 1: Obtain OneLogin SAML information

<Steps>
1. Navigate to the **SSO** tab in your OneLogin application.

    ![SSO tab in OneLogin](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/onelogin-10.png)
2. Note the **SAML 2.0 Endpoint (HTTP)**.
3. Note the **Issuer URL**.
4. Note or download the **X.509 Certificate**.
</Steps>

#### Step 2: Provide information to Tallyfy Support

<Steps>
1. Send the **SAML 2.0 Endpoint (HTTP)** to Tallyfy Support.
2. Send the **Issuer URL** to Tallyfy Support.
3. Send the **X.509 Certificate** to Tallyfy Support.
4. Tallyfy Support will configure these values in your organization's SAML settings.

</Steps>

#### Step 3: Enable SAML authentication

Once Tallyfy Support confirms they've configured your SAML settings, it's time to flip the switch:

<Steps>
1. Toggle the SAML activation switch to enable SSO for your organization

    ![Enable SAML toggle](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/onelogin-12.png)
</Steps>

### User provisioning and access

After you've completed the integration:

<Steps>
1. Get the Tallyfy login URL from the SAML configuration modal (Tallyfy Support provides this)
2. Share this URL with your team members who have access to the OneLogin application

    ![Tallyfy login URL](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/onelogin-13.png)
</Steps>

When users access Tallyfy through this URL:
- Existing Tallyfy users get in immediately with automatic authentication
- New users? They're provisioned in Tallyfy on their first login (yes, it's that simple)

### Troubleshooting

Running into authentication issues? Check these common culprits:
- Make sure the user has been assigned to the OneLogin application
- Double-check parameter mappings are configured with exact names - even a tiny typo breaks everything
- Verify the required attribute flags are enabled
- Confirm users are using the SSO URL (not the regular Tallyfy login page)
- Still stuck? Contact Tallyfy Support for help
