## How does Tallyfy Single Sign-On integration work?

Tallyfy provides free Single Sign-On (SSO) integration for all customers on paid plans, enabling smooth authentication through existing corporate identity systems and enterprise security frameworks.

SSO integration lets team members access Tallyfy using familiar company credentials from Microsoft Azure AD, Google Workspace, Okta, OneLogin, or other enterprise identity providers. This gets rid of separate password management burdens while seriously improving security through centralized authentication and access control.

For organizations that need maximum security compliance, paid plans include optional SSO-only enforcement settings that require exclusive authentication through designated identity providers, ensuring complete adherence to corporate security policies.

### What are the strategic benefits of Tallyfy SSO integration?

| Strategic Benefit      | Description                                                            |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Better Security**  | Use your organization's existing advanced security policies and multi-factor authentication for Tallyfy access |
| **Streamlined User Experience** | Enable smooth login using familiar corporate usernames and passwords without additional credential management |
| **Centralized Access Control** | Manage comprehensive Tallyfy access permissions directly from your primary identity management system |
| **Automated Account Provisioning** | New users automatically get Tallyfy accounts upon first SSO login, getting rid of manual setup processes |
| **Consistent Security Policies** | Enforce uniform authentication rules including password complexity and session management across all systems |
| **Less IT Support Burden** | Get rid of "forgot Tallyfy password" support requests and streamline user account management |

:::tip[Secure Internal Approvals with SSO]
Using SSO provides a strong way to track internal approvals. When someone approves a task in Tallyfy after logging in via SSO, Tallyfy's audit trail records exactly who approved it and when, linked to their verified company identity. This can often replace the need for separate e-signature tools for internal approvals.

### How can I enforce SSO-only access for maximum security?

For organizations that need the highest level of authentication control and security compliance, Tallyfy can be configured to enforce mandatory "SSO only" access. This configuration ensures that all organizational members, without exception, must authenticate exclusively through your designated Single Sign-On provider.

#### What happens when SSO-only mode is activated?
*   **Disabled Standard Authentication**: Traditional email and password logins are completely disabled organization-wide.
*   **Identity Provider Provisioning**: The ability to invite new members via email is turned off; all users must be provisioned through your corporate identity provider.

This complete enforcement ensures strict adherence to corporate authentication policies and regulatory compliance requirements. For detailed technical specifications and security implications, check our [Compliance documentation on Mandatory Single Sign-On](/products/pro/compliance/#mandatory-single-sign-on-sso).

To enable "SSO only" mode for your organization, please [contact Tallyfy support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/).

### How does the SSO authentication flow work with Tallyfy?

Once SSO integration is properly configured:

1. **Organizational Login Portal**: Users access a customized Tallyfy login link specific to your organization.
2. **Identity Provider Redirect**: Tallyfy automatically redirects users to your company's designated login portal (such as Microsoft Azure AD or Google Workspace).
3. **Corporate Authentication**: Users authenticate using their standard corporate credentials and any required multi-factor authentication.
4. **Seamless Return**: Users are automatically redirected back to Tallyfy with authenticated access established.
5. **Automatic Account Provisioning**: First-time users get automatically provisioned Tallyfy accounts based on identity provider attributes.

### What are the requirements for SSO setup?

Setting up SSO integration needs coordinated technical configuration across both Tallyfy and your organization's identity management system:

- **Administrative Access**: Personnel with admin privileges in both Tallyfy and your identity provider are needed.
- **Technical Configuration Exchange**: Critical technical details including URLs, security certificates, and metadata must be accurately configured between systems.
- **User Attribute Mapping**: Proper setup of user information transmission (including email, name, and role attributes) from your identity provider to Tallyfy.
- **Complete Testing**: Thorough testing across various user scenarios before organization-wide deployment.

### How can I get started with SSO implementation?

1. **Identity Provider Selection**: Choose the right setup guide for your organization's identity management system.
2. **Tallyfy Support Engagement**: Contact Tallyfy support or your dedicated account manager to start SSO configuration planning.
3. **Collaborative Implementation**: Execute the configuration steps carefully in coordination with your IT team and identity management administrators.
4. **User Acceptance Testing**: Do thorough testing of the authentication flow with representative users across different roles.
5. **Organization-wide Deployment**: Tell your organization about the new authentication method and provide transition guidance.
