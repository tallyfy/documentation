## Single Sign-On (SSO) Integration

Tallyfy provides free integration with leading Single Sign-On (SSO) identity providers, simplifying user authentication across your organization. SSO eliminates the need for separate Tallyfy credentials by leveraging your existing identity management system. Please note that SSO can only be set up free of charge for customers who have already upgraded to a paid plan.

### Key benefits of SSO integration

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Security Enhancement | Apply your organization's existing security policies and controls |
| Simplified Access | Users log in with familiar corporate credentials |
| Centralized Management | Manage user access from a single administration console |
| Automated Provisioning | Create Tallyfy accounts automatically when users authenticate |
| Streamlined Compliance | Enforce consistent authentication requirements |
| Reduced IT Support | Eliminate password reset requests for Tallyfy |

### How SSO works with Tallyfy

When SSO is enabled:

1. Users click the Tallyfy SSO login link specific to your organization
2. They are redirected to your identity provider's login page
3. After successful authentication, they return to Tallyfy automatically
4. New users are provisioned with appropriate access levels
5. Existing users gain immediate access to their account
