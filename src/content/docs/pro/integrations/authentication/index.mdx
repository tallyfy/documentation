## Single Sign-On integration

Tallyfy includes free Single Sign-On (SSO) for all paid plans. Your team logs in with existing corporate credentials from Microsoft Entra ID, Google Workspace, Okta, OneLogin, JumpCloud, or any SAML 2.0 provider. Setup takes about 30 minutes.

You can also enforce SSO-only access - blocking email/password logins entirely.

### SSO benefits

| Benefit | What it means |
|---------|---------------|
| **Security** | Apply your org's existing security policies and MFA to Tallyfy |
| **One login** | Team members use their corporate username and password |
| **Access control** | Manage Tallyfy permissions from your identity provider |
| **Auto-provisioning** | New users get Tallyfy accounts on first SSO login |
| **Consistent policies** | Same password complexity and session rules across all systems |
| **Less IT overhead** | No more Tallyfy-specific password resets |

### SSO as replacement for e-signatures

SSO authentication creates audit trails that can replace e-signature tools for internal approvals.

**Why skip traditional e-signatures for internal use?**
- Extra cost per signature/user
- Separate system to manage
- Workflow interruption - users leave Tallyfy, sign elsewhere, then return

**SSO-based approvals give you:**
- **No extra cost** - included with paid Tallyfy plans
- **Identity verification** - corporate SSO confirms the approver's identity
- **Audit trail** - every approval logged with timestamp and user identity
- **No context switching** - approvers complete tasks without leaving Tallyfy
- **Legal compliance** - meets requirements for internal corporate approvals in most jurisdictions

**Common use cases:** purchase orders, policy acknowledgments, budget authorizations, project sign-offs, compliance confirmations, HR approvals.

:::tip[Best practice for approval workflows]
Create a dedicated "Approval" task type in your templates with:
1. Approval criteria in the task description
2. Required Yes/No form field for the approval decision
3. Required text field for approval comments/conditions
4. Automatic email notification upon completion

This creates a timestamped, authenticated approval record without external e-signature tools.
:::

:::note[When you still need traditional e-signatures]
For external party signatures (customers, vendors) or specific regulatory requirements (some healthcare/financial documents), you may still need dedicated e-signature tools. Tallyfy integrates with DocuSign and similar platforms for these scenarios.

### Enforcing SSO-only access

Tallyfy can lock down your org so SSO is the only login method. When `sso_auth_only` is enabled:

- Email and password logins are disabled org-wide
- Manual member invites are blocked - all users must come through your identity provider
- Non-SSO login attempts redirect to your SAML login page

For security details, see [Compliance documentation on Mandatory Single Sign-On](/products/pro/compliance/#mandatory-single-sign-on-sso).

To enable SSO-only mode, [contact Tallyfy support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/).

### SSO authentication flow

Here's what happens when someone logs in via SSO:

1. User visits your org's Tallyfy login link
2. Tallyfy redirects to your identity provider (Entra ID, Google, etc.)
3. User authenticates with corporate credentials and MFA
4. Identity provider sends a SAML assertion back to Tallyfy
5. First-time users get accounts created automatically from identity provider data (email, first name, last name)

[**JumpCloud Setup Guide →**](/products/pro/integrations/authentication/how-to-integrate-jumpcloud-samlsso-with-tallyfy/)

#### Other SAML 2.0 providers
Any SAML 2.0-compatible identity provider works. Contact support to verify compatibility.

### Requirements for SSO setup

- **Admin access** in both Tallyfy and your identity provider
- **Metadata exchange** - URLs, certificates, and entity IDs between systems
- **Attribute mapping** - email, first name, and last name fields from your identity provider to Tallyfy
- **Testing** - verify with different user types before rolling out org-wide

:::note[SSO with MCP servers]
If you're using [MCP servers](/products/pro/integrations/mcp-server/) for AI workflows, SSO can extend to those too. See [SSO authentication with MCP servers](/products/pro/integrations/mcp-server/sso-authentication/).
:::

### Getting started

1. Pick the setup guide for your identity provider above
2. [Contact Tallyfy support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/) or your account manager
3. Your IT team configures the identity provider side
4. Test with users from different departments and roles
5. Tell your team about the new login process

### Troubleshooting authentication issues

#### Authentication loops

If you're stuck in a login loop or can't get past the login screen, visit [https://account.tallyfy.com/logout](https://account.tallyfy.com/logout) to clear all sessions. Then clear your browser cookies for tallyfy.com, wait 10-15 seconds, and log in again.

For more details, see the [authentication loop resolution guide](/products/pro/miscellaneous/troubleshooting/#how-do-i-fix-authentication-loops-when-logging-in).

#### Common SSO issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Login loops with SSO** | Visit [https://account.tallyfy.com/logout](https://account.tallyfy.com/logout), then re-authenticate |
| **Can't switch orgs** | Force logout and clear cookies for all tallyfy.com domains |
| **SSO and password login conflict** | Clear all sessions via the logout URL before switching methods |
| **"Need admin approval" message** | Your IT admin must approve Tallyfy in the identity provider settings |
