## How does Tallyfy Single Sign-On integration work?

Tallyfy provides free Single Sign-On (SSO) integration for all customers on paid plans, enabling smooth authentication through existing corporate identity systems and enterprise security frameworks.

SSO integration lets team members access Tallyfy using familiar company credentials from Microsoft Azure AD, Google Workspace, Okta, OneLogin, or other enterprise identity providers. This gets rid of separate password management burdens while seriously improving security through centralized authentication and access control.

For organizations that need maximum security compliance, paid plans include optional SSO-only enforcement settings that require exclusive authentication through designated identity providers, ensuring complete adherence to corporate security policies.

### What are the strategic benefits of Tallyfy SSO integration?

| Strategic Benefit      | Description                                                            |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Better Security**  | Use your organization's existing advanced security policies and multi-factor authentication for Tallyfy access |
| **Streamlined User Experience** | Enable smooth login using familiar corporate usernames and passwords without additional credential management |
| **Centralized Access Control** | Manage comprehensive Tallyfy access permissions directly from your primary identity management system |
| **Automated Account Provisioning** | New users automatically get Tallyfy accounts upon first SSO login, getting rid of manual setup processes |
| **Consistent Security Policies** | Enforce uniform authentication rules including password complexity and session management across all systems |
| **Less IT Support Burden** | Get rid of "forgot Tallyfy password" support requests and streamline user account management |

### How can SSO replace e-signatures for internal approvals?

SSO authentication creates legally defensible audit trails that can replace traditional e-signature solutions for internal company approvals. Here's why this matters:

**Traditional e-signature challenges**:
- Additional cost per signature/user
- Separate system to manage and train users on
- Workflow interruption (leave Tallyfy, sign document, return)
- Limited integration with your process tracking

**SSO-based approval advantages**:
- **Zero additional cost**: Included free with all paid Tallyfy plans
- **Stronger identity verification**: Corporate SSO confirms the approver's identity through your company's authentication system
- **Complete audit trail**: Every approval is logged with timestamp, user identity, and IP address
- **Seamless workflow**: Approvers simply complete their task - no external tools needed
- **Legal compliance**: SSO authentication meets requirements for internal corporate approvals in most jurisdictions

**Common use cases for SSO-based approvals**:
- Purchase order approvals
- Internal policy acknowledgments
- Budget authorizations
- Project sign-offs
- Compliance confirmations
- HR document approvals

:::tip[Best practice for approval workflows]
Create a dedicated "Approval" task type in your templates with:
1. Clear approval criteria in the task description
2. A required Yes/No form field for the approval decision
3. A required text field for approval comments/conditions
4. Automatic email notification upon completion

This creates a timestamped, authenticated approval record without external e-signature tools.
:::

:::note[When you still need traditional e-signatures]
For external party signatures (customers, vendors) or specific regulatory requirements (some healthcare/financial documents), you may still need dedicated e-signature tools. Tallyfy integrates with DocuSign and similar platforms for these scenarios.

### How can I enforce SSO-only access for maximum security?

For organizations that need the highest level of authentication control and security compliance, Tallyfy can be configured to enforce mandatory "SSO only" access. This configuration ensures that all organizational members, without exception, must authenticate exclusively through your designated Single Sign-On provider.

#### What happens when SSO-only mode is activated?
*   **Disabled Standard Authentication**: Traditional email and password logins are completely disabled organization-wide.
*   **Identity Provider Provisioning**: The ability to invite new members via email is turned off; all users must be provisioned through your corporate identity provider.

This complete enforcement ensures strict adherence to corporate authentication policies and regulatory compliance requirements. For detailed technical specifications and security implications, check our [Compliance documentation on Mandatory Single Sign-On](/products/pro/compliance/#mandatory-single-sign-on-sso).

To enable "SSO only" mode for your organization, please [contact Tallyfy support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/).

### How does the SSO authentication flow work with Tallyfy?

Once SSO integration is properly configured:

1. **Organizational Login Portal**: Users access a customized Tallyfy login link specific to your organization.
2. **Identity Provider Redirect**: Tallyfy automatically redirects users to your company's designated login portal (such as Microsoft Azure AD or Google Workspace).
3. **Corporate Authentication**: Users authenticate using their standard corporate credentials and any required multi-factor authentication.
4. **Seamless Return**: Users are automatically redirected back to Tallyfy with authenticated access established.
5. **Automatic Account Provisioning**: First-time users get automatically provisioned Tallyfy accounts based on identity provider attributes.

### What are the requirements for SSO setup?

Setting up SSO integration needs coordinated technical configuration across both Tallyfy and your organization's identity management system:

- **Administrative Access**: Personnel with admin privileges in both Tallyfy and your identity provider are needed.
- **Technical Configuration Exchange**: Critical technical details including URLs, security certificates, and metadata must be accurately configured between systems.
- **User Attribute Mapping**: Proper setup of user information transmission (including email, name, and role attributes) from your identity provider to Tallyfy.
- **Complete Testing**: Thorough testing across various user scenarios before organization-wide deployment.

:::note[Advanced SSO Integration with AI Tools]
