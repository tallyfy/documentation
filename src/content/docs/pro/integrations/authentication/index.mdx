## Single Sign-On (SSO) Integration

Tallyfy offers free Single Sign-On (SSO) integration for customers on paid plans. SSO lets your team members log into Tallyfy using the same username and password they already use for other company systems (like their Microsoft, Google, Okta, or OneLogin accounts).

This means they don't need a separate Tallyfy password, making login easier and more secure.

### Key benefits of using SSO

| Benefit                | Description                                                            |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Better Security        | Use your company's existing security rules for Tallyfy logins.        |
| Easier User Access     | Log in with familiar company usernames and passwords.                  |
| Central Management     | Manage who can access Tallyfy from your main identity system.          |
| Automatic Account Setup| New users can automatically get a Tallyfy account the first time they log in via SSO. |
| Consistent Rules       | Enforce the same login rules (like password complexity) everywhere.   |
| Fewer Support Tickets  | No more "forgot Tallyfy password" requests for your IT team.          |

:::tip[Secure Internal Approvals with SSO]
Using SSO provides a strong way to track internal approvals. When someone approves a task in Tallyfy after logging in via SSO, Tallyfy's audit trail records exactly who approved it and when, linked to their verified company identity. This can often replace the need for separate e-signature tools for internal approvals.

### How SSO login works with Tallyfy

Once SSO is set up:

1. Users go to a special Tallyfy login link for your company.
2. Tallyfy sends them to your company's login page (e.g., Microsoft or Google login).
3. They log in using their normal company password.
4. They are automatically redirected back to Tallyfy, already logged in.
5. If it's their first time, Tallyfy might automatically create an account for them.

#### Other SAML 2.0 Systems

### What's needed to set up SSO?

Setting up SSO requires technical steps in both Tallyfy and your company's login system:

- You need someone with Admin access to both systems.
- Technical details (like URLs and security certificates) need to be copied between the systems.
- You need to configure how user information (like email and name) is sent to Tallyfy.
- You should test it thoroughly before making everyone use it.

### Getting started with SSO

1. Choose the setup guide below that matches your company's login system.
2. Contact Tallyfy support or your account manager to let them know you want to set up SSO.
3. Follow the steps in the guide carefully, working with your IT team.
4. Test the login process with a few users.
5. Announce the new login method to your organization.
