## How does Tallyfy Single Sign-On integration work?

Tallyfy provides free Single Sign-On (SSO) integration for all customers on paid plans - no hidden fees, no per-user charges. You can connect it to your existing corporate identity systems in about 30 minutes.

Here's the deal: Your team members use their familiar company credentials from Microsoft Azure AD, Google Workspace, Okta, OneLogin, or other enterprise identity providers to access Tallyfy. No more password resets. No more IT tickets about forgotten logins. Just one set of credentials for everything.

Want maximum security? Paid plans include optional SSO-only enforcement settings that require everyone to authenticate exclusively through your designated identity provider. This means complete control over who accesses your workflows.

### What are the strategic benefits of Tallyfy SSO integration?

| Strategic Benefit      | Description                                                            |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Better Security**  | Use your organization's existing security policies and multi-factor authentication for Tallyfy access |
| **Streamlined User Experience** | Let users log in with their familiar corporate username and password - no extra credentials to remember |
| **Centralized Access Control** | Manage all Tallyfy access permissions directly from your main identity management system |
| **Automated Account Provisioning** | New users automatically get Tallyfy accounts on first SSO login - no manual setup needed |
| **Consistent Security Policies** | Enforce the same authentication rules (password complexity, session timeouts) across all your systems |
| **Less IT Support Burden** | Eliminate "forgot Tallyfy password" support tickets and simplify user account management |

### How can SSO replace e-signatures for internal approvals?

SSO authentication creates legally defensible audit trails that can replace traditional e-signature solutions for internal company approvals. Think about it - why pay extra for e-signatures when SSO already proves who clicked "approve"?

**Traditional e-signature challenges**:
- Additional cost per signature/user
- Another system to manage and train users on
- Workflow interruption (leave Tallyfy, sign document, return)
- Limited integration with your process tracking

**SSO-based approval advantages**:
- **Zero additional cost**: Included free with all paid Tallyfy plans
- **Stronger identity verification**: Corporate SSO confirms the approver's identity through your company's authentication system
- **Complete audit trail**: Every approval gets logged with timestamp, user identity, and IP address
- **Seamless workflow**: Approvers just complete their task - no jumping between tools
- **Legal compliance**: SSO authentication meets requirements for internal corporate approvals in most jurisdictions

**Common use cases for SSO-based approvals**:
- Purchase order approvals
- Internal policy acknowledgments
- Budget authorizations
- Project sign-offs
- Compliance confirmations
- HR document approvals

:::tip[Best practice for approval workflows]
Create a dedicated "Approval" task type in your templates with:
1. Clear approval criteria in the task description
2. A required Yes/No form field for the approval decision
3. A required text field for approval comments/conditions
4. Automatic email notification upon completion

This creates a timestamped, authenticated approval record without external e-signature tools.
:::

:::note[When you still need traditional e-signatures]
For external party signatures (customers, vendors) or specific regulatory requirements (some healthcare/financial documents), you may still need dedicated e-signature tools. Tallyfy integrates with DocuSign and similar platforms for these scenarios.

### How can I enforce SSO-only access for maximum security?

Some organizations need everyone - and we mean everyone - to authenticate through their corporate SSO. No exceptions. Tallyfy can lock down access so that SSO becomes the only way in.

#### What happens when SSO-only mode is activated?
*   **Disabled Standard Authentication**: Traditional email and password logins? Gone. Completely disabled organization-wide.
*   **Identity Provider Provisioning**: Can't invite new members via email anymore - all users must come through your corporate identity provider.

This gives you total control over authentication and helps meet those strict compliance requirements. For the technical details and security implications, check our [Compliance documentation on Mandatory Single Sign-On](/products/pro/compliance/#mandatory-single-sign-on-sso).

Ready to enable "SSO only" mode? Just [contact Tallyfy support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/).

### How does the SSO authentication flow work with Tallyfy?

Here's what happens when your team logs in with SSO:

1. **Organizational Login Portal**: Users hit a customized Tallyfy login link made just for your organization.
2. **Identity Provider Redirect**: Tallyfy sends them straight to your company's login portal (like Microsoft Azure AD or Google Workspace).
3. **Corporate Authentication**: They enter their regular work credentials and complete any multi-factor authentication you've set up.
4. **Seamless Return**: After authentication, they're automatically sent back to Tallyfy - already logged in.
5. **Automatic Account Provisioning**: First-time users? Tallyfy creates their accounts automatically using info from your identity provider.

### What identity providers does Tallyfy support?

Tallyfy works with all the major enterprise identity management systems:

#### Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD)
- Microsoft's enterprise cloud identity and access management platform.
- Includes conditional access, multi-factor authentication, and all those security features IT teams love.

[**Azure AD Setup Guide →**](/products/pro/integrations/authentication/how-to-integrate-azure-ad-samlsso-with-tallyfy/)

#### Google Workspace (formerly G Suite)
- Google's identity and productivity platform for businesses.
- Perfect if you're already using Gmail, Drive, and other Google business tools.

[**Google Workspace Setup Guide →**](/products/pro/integrations/authentication/how-to-integrate-google-suite-samlsso-with-tallyfy/)

#### Okta
- The cloud-based identity service that pretty much everyone has heard of - specializes in enterprise SSO.

[**Okta Setup Guide →**](/products/pro/integrations/authentication/how-to-integrate-okta-samlsso-with-tallyfy/)

#### OneLogin
- All-in-one identity and access management platform with strong SSO capabilities.

[**OneLogin Setup Guide →**](/products/pro/integrations/authentication/how-to-integrate-onelogin-samlsso-with-tallyfy/)

#### Other SAML 2.0 Compatible Systems
Got a different identity provider? As long as it supports SAML 2.0 (and most do), you're good to go. Contact Tallyfy support to verify compatibility with your specific system.

### What are the requirements for SSO setup?

Setting up SSO takes some coordination between your IT team and Tallyfy. Here's what you'll need:

- **Administrative Access**: You need admin rights in both Tallyfy and your identity provider. No way around this one.
- **Technical Configuration Exchange**: URLs, security certificates, and metadata need to be swapped between the systems - your IT team will know what these are.
- **User Attribute Mapping**: Configure how user info (email, name, role) flows from your identity provider to Tallyfy.
- **Complete Testing**: Test with different user types before rolling it out company-wide. Trust us on this.

:::note[Advanced SSO Integration with AI Tools]
For organizations implementing AI workflows with [Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers](/products/pro/integrations/mcp-server/), advanced SSO patterns enable seamless authentication across AI applications. Learn about [enterprise SSO integration with MCP servers](/products/pro/integrations/mcp-server/sso-authentication/) for unified identity management across AI-powered workflow tools.

### How can I get started with SSO implementation?

1. **Pick Your Provider**: Check which setup guide matches your identity system (Azure AD, Google, Okta, or OneLogin).
2. **Contact Support**: Reach out to Tallyfy support or your account manager - they'll walk you through the process.
3. **Work With IT**: Your IT team needs to be involved. They'll handle the technical configuration on your identity provider's side.
4. **Test Everything**: Run tests with users from different departments and roles. Catch issues before they affect everyone.
5. **Roll It Out**: Let your team know about the new login process. Most people are relieved they don't need another password!
