## Tallyfy Analytics overview

Tallyfy Analytics is an add-on that copies your workflow data to a dedicated analytical infrastructure - every task, every process, ready for deep analysis.

You can connect BI tools like Tableau, Power BI, and Looker directly to your Tallyfy data. Build custom reports that answer questions the standard interface can't. Track trends over months. Spot bottlenecks fast.

### Key features

- **Full process data access** - every workflow, task, and form field sits in your analytical database, ready to query.
- **SQL query capabilities** - write SQL to slice your data however you need. Join tables, aggregate metrics, filter by date ranges.
- **BI tool integration** - works with any tool that supports Amazon Athena[^1], which covers most enterprise BI platforms.
- **Custom dashboards** - build exactly the reports your team needs, without waiting on feature requests.
- **Trend analysis** - see how your processes evolve over 3, 6, or 12+ months. Historical data tells the real story.

### Operational details

- **Add-on service** - contact Tallyfy for details, as availability varies by data volume.
- **Private infrastructure** - your data lives in its own Amazon Athena environment. No other accounts can access it.

### Tracking time spent on tasks

Tallyfy Analytics captures task completion timestamps automatically, but actual working time needs a different approach. See our guide on [how to track time spent on tasks](/products/pro/tutorials/how-to/track-time-in-tasks/) for implementing clean time tracking with form fields. This captures real effort time, not just elapsed calendar time.

:::note[Data collection starts after activation]
Tallyfy only starts collecting and processing data for Analytics *after* you activate the add-on. Historical data from before activation is not included.
:::

:::note[Timestamp handling in Analytics]
All timestamps in Tallyfy Analytics are stored in ISO 8601 format[^2] without timezone information - keeping data consistent for analysis across global teams. In Tallyfy's interface, these timestamps are converted to each user's personal timezone setting.

### Security credentials

Once Tallyfy activates Analytics for you, you'll receive two sets of credentials:

1. **AWS Console administrative login** - full access to the AWS web console where you can manage users, set permissions, and monitor usage.
2. **API Access Key and Secret Key pair** - these connect your BI tools to the data. You'll paste them into Power BI, Tableau, or whatever tool you use.

### Getting started

Contact Tallyfy support or your account manager to get started. They'll walk you through setup and configuration.
