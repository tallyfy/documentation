## Tallyfy Analytics plugs into your existing BI platform

Tallyfy Analytics is an add-on for annual plans that allows you to query and analyze all your processes.

It's billed for all active members of your organization at the retail rate of US $20 per member, per annum. Please get in touch with us if you wish to enable it for your organization.

People often connect their analytics visualization platform into our platform to create custom dashboards. We support any BI platform that supports Amazon Athena's ODBC and JDBC drivers. See more about that [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/athena-bi-tools-jdbc-odbc.html).

Examples of BI (Business Intelligence) and analytics platforms are Tableau, PowerBI, Looker, etc.
