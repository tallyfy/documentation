## Tallyfy Analytics Overview

Tallyfy Analytics is an optional add-on service. It copies your Tallyfy process data to a separate, secure location where you can connect business intelligence (BI) tools (like Tableau, Power BI, Looker) to analyze it and create custom reports.

### Key features:

- **Access your process data**: Get detailed information from your workflows.
- **Use SQL queries**: Ask complex questions about your data using standard SQL.
- **Connect BI tools**: Works with reporting tools that can connect to Amazon Athena.
- **Build custom dashboards**: Create reports and charts specific to your company's needs.
- **Analyze trends**: Track how processes perform over time.

### How it works:

- It's an add-on service, usually for customers on annual plans.
- There is an extra cost (contact Tallyfy for current pricing).
- Your data is stored securely in your own private space using Amazon Athena (part of AWS).

:::note[Data Collection Starts After Activation]
Tallyfy only starts collecting and processing data for Analytics *after* you have purchased and activated the add-on. It does not include data from before activation.
:::

### Security Keys Provided

When Tallyfy Analytics is set up for you, Tallyfy will provide two types of secure keys:

1. **AWS Console Login**: For administrators to log into the AWS web console (if needed for advanced configuration).
2. **Access Key & Secret Key**: These are used specifically to connect your BI tools (like Power BI or Tableau) to your Tallyfy data in Amazon Athena.

To get started with Tallyfy Analytics, please contact Tallyfy support or your account manager.
