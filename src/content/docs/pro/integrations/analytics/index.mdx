## Tallyfy Analytics plugs into your existing BI platform

Tallyfy Analytics is an add-on for annual plans that allows you to query and analyze all your processes.

It's billed for all active members of your organization at the retail rate of US $20 per member, per annum. Please get in touch with us if you wish to enable it for your organization.

People often connect their analytics visualization platform into our platform to create custom dashboards. We support any BI platform that supports Amazon Athena's ODBC and JDBC drivers. See more about that [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/athena-bi-tools-jdbc-odbc.html).

Examples of BI (Business Intelligence) and analytics platforms are Tableau, PowerBI, Looker, etc.

## Important note

When you provision Tallyfy Analytics you will receive two sets of credentials.

* The _AWS IAM login_ is only used to access the AWS console on the web
* The _Access Key_ and _Secret Access Key_ is what you need to connect to the Athena database with BI tools
