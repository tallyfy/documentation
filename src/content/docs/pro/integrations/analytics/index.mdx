## What is Tallyfy Analytics and how does it work?

Tallyfy Analytics is an add-on that copies your workflow data to a dedicated analytical infrastructure. You get the full picture - every task, every process, ready for deep analysis.

Here's what makes it powerful: you can connect your favorite BI tools like Tableau, Power BI, and Looker directly to your Tallyfy data. Build custom reports that answer questions the standard interface can't. Track trends over months. Spot bottlenecks instantly.

### What key features does Tallyfy Analytics provide?

- **Complete Process Data Access**: Every workflow, every task, every field - it's all there in your analytical database.
- **Advanced SQL Query Capabilities**: Write SQL queries to slice your data any way you need. Join tables, aggregate metrics, filter by date ranges.
- **Business Intelligence Tool Integration**: Works with any tool that supports Amazon Athena - that's most enterprise BI platforms.
- **Custom Dashboard Creation**: Build exactly the reports your team needs. No more waiting for feature requests.
- **Trend Analysis and Performance Tracking**: See how your processes evolve over 3 months, 6 months, or longer. Historical data tells the real story.

### How does Tallyfy Analytics function operationally?

- **Add-on Service**: It's an add-on feature for Tallyfy customers.
- **Additional Service**: This is an add-on service (contact Tallyfy for details - availability varies by data volume).
- **Secure Private Infrastructure**: Your data lives in its own private Amazon Athena environment. Nobody else can access it.

### What about tracking time spent on tasks?

While Tallyfy Analytics automatically captures task completion timestamps, getting accurate data about actual working time requires a different approach. See our guide on [how to track time spent on tasks](/products/pro/tutorials/how-to/track-time-in-tasks/) to learn about implementing clean time tracking with form fields - this ensures you capture real effort time, not just elapsed calendar time.

:::note[Data Collection Starts After Activation]
Tallyfy only starts collecting and processing data for Analytics *after* you have activated the add-on. It does not include data from before activation.
:::

:::note[Timestamp handling in Analytics]
All timestamps in Tallyfy Analytics data are stored in ISO 8601 format without timezone information. This ensures consistent, timezone-agnostic data storage for accurate analysis across global teams. In Tallyfy's user interface, these universal timestamps are automatically converted to show in each user's personal timezone setting.

### What security credentials does Tallyfy Analytics provide?

Once we activate Analytics for you, you'll receive two sets of credentials:

1. **AWS Console Administrative Login**: Full access to the AWS web console where you can manage users, set permissions, and monitor usage.
2. **API Access Key & Secret Key Pair**: These connect your BI tools to the data. You'll paste them into Power BI, Tableau, or whatever tool you're using.
