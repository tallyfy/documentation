## Tallyfy Analytics Overview

Tallyfy Analytics is an optional add-on service. It copies your Tallyfy process data to a separate, secure location where you can connect business intelligence (BI) tools (like Tableau, Power BI, Looker) to analyze it and create custom reports.

### Key features:

- **Access your process data**: Get detailed information from your workflows.
- **Use SQL queries**: Ask complex questions about your data using standard SQL.
- **Connect BI tools**: Works with reporting tools that can connect to Amazon Athena.
- **Build custom dashboards**: Create reports and charts specific to your company's needs.
- **Analyze trends**: Track how processes perform over time.

### How it works:

- It's an add-on service, usually for customers on annual plans.
- There is an extra cost (contact Tallyfy for current pricing).
- Your data is stored securely in your own private space using Amazon Athena (part of AWS).

:::note[Data Collection Starts After Activation]
Tallyfy only starts collecting and processing data for Analytics *after* you have purchased and activated the add-on. It does not include data from before activation.

### Security Keys Provided

When Tallyfy Analytics is set up for you, Tallyfy will provide two types of secure keys:

1. **AWS Console Login**: For administrators to log into the AWS web console (if needed for advanced configuration).
2. **Access Key & Secret Key**: These are used specifically to connect your BI tools (like Power BI or Tableau) to your Tallyfy data in Amazon Athena.
