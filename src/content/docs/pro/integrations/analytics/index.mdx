Tallyfy Analytics is an advanced add-on service that securely copies your complete workflow process data to dedicated analytical infrastructure for sophisticated business intelligence analysis and strategic decision-making.

:::note[Data Collection Starts After Activation]
Tallyfy only starts collecting and processing data for Analytics *after* you have purchased and activated the add-on. It does not include data from before activation.
:::

:::note[Timestamp handling in Analytics]
All timestamps in Tallyfy Analytics data are stored in ISO 8601 format without timezone information. This ensures consistent, timezone-agnostic data storage for accurate analysis across global teams. In Tallyfy's user interface, these universal timestamps are automatically converted to show in each user's personal timezone setting.
