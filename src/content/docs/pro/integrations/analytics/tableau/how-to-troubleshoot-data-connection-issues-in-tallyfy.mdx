## Fixing Tableau connection problems with Tallyfy Analytics

Tableau connects to Tallyfy Analytics data through Amazon Athena using JDBC. When that connection breaks, here's how to diagnose and fix it.

### Use the right credentials

Tallyfy provides two credential sets when Analytics is activated. Using the wrong one is the most common connection failure.

| Credential type | Use for | Common problem |
|----------------|---------|----------------|
| IAM Username/Password | AWS web console access only | Causes "security token invalid" errors in Tableau |
| Access Key/Secret Key | Tableau and all BI tool connections | More reliable - use this one |

:::caution[Important]
Always use the **Access Key and Secret Access Key** for Tableau connections. IAM console credentials don't work with JDBC-based BI tool connections.
:::

### Authentication errors

If you see "The security token included in the request is invalid":

<Steps>
1. Confirm you're using the Access Key/Secret Key pair - not your IAM console login
2. Check that your credentials haven't been rotated or expired
3. Verify the region setting matches your Athena endpoint (e.g., `us-east-1`)
</Steps>

### Missing or broken data source

When Tableau can't find a previously working data source:

<Steps>
1. Open the Tableau workbook showing the disconnected data source

2. Select **Show Details** when prompted about the missing data source to see the specific error

3. Click **Yes** when asked if you want to reconnect

4. Select **Edit Connection** to update your settings

5. Re-enter your Access Key, Secret Access Key, S3 staging directory, and region
6. A successful connection will refresh your dashboard with current data
</Steps>

### Connection that can't be edited

If **Edit Connection** is grayed out or unresponsive, remove and recreate the connection:

<Steps>
1. Delete the existing data connection from your workbook
2. Add a new connection to Amazon Athena
3. Enter all connection parameters - Access Key, Secret Access Key, Athena endpoint, port `443`, S3 staging directory, and region
4. Select your database and reconnect to your data tables
</Steps>

### Date fields showing wrong types

Tallyfy stores timestamps in `Y-m-d H:i:s` format. After reconnecting, date fields like `due_by` and `completed_on` sometimes lose their type mapping.

<Steps>
1. Go to the **Data Source** tab and find your date fields
2. Right-click each date field and select **Change Data Type** > **Date & Time**
3. Verify that date-based filters and calculations work correctly
</Steps>

### Sharing workbooks securely

When sharing Tableau workbooks that connect to Tallyfy Analytics:

<Steps>
1. Use Tableau's **Extract** feature to create a local snapshot of the data - this avoids sharing credentials
2. For ongoing access, use **Published Data Sources** in Tableau Server/Online
3. If sharing live connections, make sure recipients have their own Tallyfy Analytics credentials
4. Never embed your Access Key or Secret Access Key in shared workbooks
</Steps>

### Preventing connection issues

- Keep Tableau Desktop and JDBC drivers up to date
- Run **Test Connection** after driver updates or credential changes
- Store your connection settings (endpoint, region, S3 staging directory) in a secure location
- Create data extracts as backups for critical dashboards
- Schedule regular extract refreshes in Tableau Server/Online
