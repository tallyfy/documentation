## Having issues with your data connection on Tableau?

Amazon offers a couple of ways to connect to their internal resources:

* IAM username and password
* Token-based authentication i.e. an Access Key

The first and most important point about integrating to PowerBI is that unlike Tableau and other BI tools - we've found that it's a lot easier to use token-based authentication for this purpose. If you try connecting with the IAM method to Amazon Athena from Power BI via ODBC - you get an error like this quite often:

> The security token included in the request is invalid

Tallyfy will create and provision the token-based credentials you need as part of the provisioning process for Tallyfy Analytics.

## Token-based connection to AWS Athena

You will be given the following from Tallyfy **as a substitute** for your IAM username and password:

* Access key
* Secret access key

In general - regular IAM user credentials (username + password) should be used only to access resources via AWS console - https://aws.amazon.com/

For all other integrations (just like this ODBC driver) the external service access keys (Access Key and Secret Access Key) should be used.

If you're experiencing data connection issues in Tallyfy, follow these steps:

1. Open your Tableau Workbook with the data and graphs.

2. Change the data connection to blank files. This step may not be necessary unless you want to hide file names.

3. Save the file and exit Tableau.

4. Move the file to a different directory, simulating the transfer of the file to someone else.

5. Open the file from the new directory. You may encounter an error message if the attached data sources are not in the new directory or filepath.

6. Select "Show Details" to understand the error.

7. Choose "Yes" to connect to your data.

8. Select "Edit Connection" if needed.

9. If "Edit Connection" doesn't work, you may need to remove the connection and add a new one. Unfortunately, there's no clear explanation why this occurs.

10. Once the connection is established, you'll see the same information in the dashboard with the new data.

11. Don't forget to adjust the data type of the fields "due_by" and "completed_on" if necessary.
