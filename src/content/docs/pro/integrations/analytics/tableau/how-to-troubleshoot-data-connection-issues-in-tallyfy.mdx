## Troubleshooting Tableau Data Connection Issues

Nothing's more frustrating than a broken data connection right when you need your dashboard. Here's how to fix common Tableau connection problems with Tallyfy Analytics - and prevent them from happening again.

### Authentication Best Practices

Amazon Athena (which hosts Tallyfy Analytics data) gives you two ways to authenticate:

| Authentication Method | Recommended For | Common Issues |
|----------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| IAM Username/Password | AWS Console access only | Frequent "security token invalid" errors with BI tools |
| Access Key/Secret Key | All BI tool connections | More reliable, fewer token expiration issues |

:::caution[Important]
Always use the Access Key and Secret Access Key provided by Tallyfy for Tableau connections. IAM credentials (username/password) should only be used for accessing the AWS web console.
:::

You'll get two credential sets from Tallyfy when they set up your Analytics account:
- **AWS IAM Login** - Use only for AWS console access at https://aws.amazon.com/
- **Access Key and Secret Access Key** - Use for connecting Tableau to Athena

### Common Connection Issues and Solutions

#### Issue 1: Authentication Errors

That dreaded "The security token included in the request is invalid" error? Here's what to check:

<Steps>
1. Verify you're using the Access Key/Secret Key (not IAM credentials)
2. Check that your credentials haven't expired
3. Ensure you're using the correct region setting
</Steps>

#### Issue 2: Missing or Broken Data Source

Your workbook's data connection went missing? Don't panic. Follow these steps:

<Steps>
1. Open your Tableau workbook with the disconnected data source

4. Select **Edit Connection** to update your connection settings

5. Enter your Access Key, Secret Access Key, and other connection details
6. If the connection is successful, your dashboard will refresh with the current data
</Steps>

#### Issue 3: Connection Cannot Be Edited

Sometimes the **Edit Connection** option just won't work. When that happens:

<Steps>
1. Remove the existing connection completely
2. Create a new connection to Amazon Athena
3. Re-enter all connection parameters using your Access Key and Secret Access Key
4. Reconnect to your data tables
</Steps>

### Data Type Issues

After reconnecting, your date fields might look weird. Fix them like this:

<Steps>
1. In the **Data Source** tab, locate fields like "due_by" and "completed_on"
2. Right-click each field and select **Change Data Type** > **Date & Time**
3. Verify that date comparisons and calculations now work correctly
</Steps>

### Sharing Workbooks Safely

Need to share your masterpiece with colleagues? Keep these security tips in mind:

<Steps>
1. Use Tableau's **Extract** feature to create a local copy of the data
2. Alternatively, use **Published Data Sources** in Tableau Server/Online
3. For direct connections, ensure recipients have their own Tallyfy Analytics credentials
4. Never embed your credentials in shared workbooks
</Steps>

### Preventative Measures

Want to avoid these headaches in the future? Here's what works:

- Keep Tableau Desktop and drivers up to date
- Use Tableau's **Test Connection** feature regularly
- Document your connection settings in a secure location
- Create data extracts as backups for critical dashboards
- Schedule regular extract refreshes if using Tableau Server/Online
