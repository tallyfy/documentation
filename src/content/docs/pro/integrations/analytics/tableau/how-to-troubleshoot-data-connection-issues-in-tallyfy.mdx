## Troubleshooting Tableau Data Connection Issues

When working with Tallyfy Analytics and Tableau, you may occasionally encounter connection issues. This guide provides solutions for common problems and explains best practices for maintaining reliable connections.

### Authentication Best Practices

Amazon Athena (which hosts Tallyfy Analytics data) offers two authentication methods:

| Authentication Method | Recommended For | Common Issues |
|----------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| IAM Username/Password | AWS Console access only | Frequent "security token invalid" errors with BI tools |
| Access Key/Secret Key | All BI tool connections | More reliable, fewer token expiration issues |

:::caution[Important]
Always use the Access Key and Secret Access Key provided by Tallyfy for Tableau connections. IAM credentials (username/password) should only be used for accessing the AWS web console.
:::

When Tallyfy provisions your Analytics account, you will receive two distinct credential sets:
- **AWS IAM Login** - Use only for AWS console access at https://aws.amazon.com/
- **Access Key and Secret Access Key** - Use for connecting Tableau to Athena

### Common Connection Issues and Solutions

#### Issue 1: Authentication Errors

If you receive errors like "The security token included in the request is invalid":

<Steps>
1. Verify you're using the Access Key/Secret Key (not IAM credentials)
2. Check that your credentials haven't expired
3. Ensure you're using the correct region setting
</Steps>

#### Issue 2: Missing or Broken Data Source

Follow these steps when your Tableau workbook loses connection to the data source:

<Steps>
1. Open your Tableau workbook with the disconnected data source

2. When prompted about the missing data source, select **Show Details** to view the specific error

3. Click **Yes** when asked if you want to connect to your data

4. Select **Edit Connection** to update your connection settings

5. Enter your Access Key, Secret Access Key, and other connection details
6. If the connection is successful, your dashboard will refresh with the current data
</Steps>

#### Issue 3: Connection Cannot Be Edited

If the **Edit Connection** option doesn't resolve your issue:

<Steps>
1. Remove the existing connection completely
2. Create a new connection to Amazon Athena
3. Re-enter all connection parameters using your Access Key and Secret Access Key
4. Reconnect to your data tables
</Steps>

### Data Type Issues

After reconnecting, you may need to correct data type settings, particularly for date fields:

<Steps>
1. In the **Data Source** tab, locate fields like "due_by" and "completed_on"
2. Right-click each field and select **Change Data Type** > **Date & Time**
3. Verify that date comparisons and calculations now work correctly
</Steps>

### Sharing Workbooks Safely

When sharing Tableau workbooks with others:

<Steps>
1. Use Tableau's **Extract** feature to create a local copy of the data
2. Alternatively, use **Published Data Sources** in Tableau Server/Online
3. For direct connections, ensure recipients have their own Tallyfy Analytics credentials
4. Never embed your credentials in shared workbooks
</Steps>

### Preventative Measures

To minimize connection issues:

- Keep Tableau Desktop and drivers up to date
- Use Tableau's **Test Connection** feature regularly
- Document your connection settings in a secure location
- Create data extracts as backups for critical dashboards
- Schedule regular extract refreshes if using Tableau Server/Online

If you continue experiencing connection issues after following these steps, contact Tallyfy Support with specific error messages and screenshots for further assistance.
