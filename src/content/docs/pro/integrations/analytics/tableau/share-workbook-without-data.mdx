## Sharing Tableau Workbooks Without Sensitive Data

You need to share your Tableau workbook but can't expose your Tallyfy data? Here's how to share visualizations with external parties while keeping your credentials and connection details completely secure.

### Methods for Secure Workbook Sharing

| Method | Best For | Data Protection Level |
|--------|----------|----------------------|
| Data Source Disconnection | One-time sharing | Medium - Structure remains visible |
| Data Extraction with Filtering | Recurring sharing | High - Only selected data visible |
| Published Data Source | Team collaboration | High - Centralized permission control |

### Requirements

- Tableau Desktop installed
- Working Tallyfy Analytics connection in Tableau
- Visualizations and dashboards already created

## Method 1: Disconnect Data Sources

Share your workbook structure - recipients connect their own data. Perfect for one-time sharing.

### Step 1: Prepare Your Workbook

Make sure your Tableau workbook has all the visualizations and dashboards you want to share.

### Step 2: Disconnect Data Sources

<Steps>
1. Navigate to **Data** > **Data Source**
2. For each data source, right-click and select **Close**
</Steps>

Alternatively, you can:
<Steps>
1. Go to the **Data Source** tab
2. Click the dropdown menu for each data source
3. Select **Edit Connection**

</Steps>

### Step 3: Save and Share the Workbook

<Steps>
1. Save the workbook with a new name to preserve your original
2. Select **File** > **Save As**
3. Choose an appropriate location and filename
4. Share the saved file with your intended recipients
</Steps>

### Step 4: Recipient Reconnection Process

Recipients will see connection errors when they open the workbook (that's expected!):

2. Select **Edit Connection** to enter their own connection details

3. If **Edit Connection** doesn't work, they may need to remove the existing connection and create a new one:

4. After successful connection, the dashboard will populate with their data
</Steps>

## Data Type Configuration

Once reconnected, your recipients might need to fix data types - especially dates. Takes about 2 minutes:

<Steps>
1. Navigate to the **Data Source** tab.
2. Locate date fields like "due_by" and "completed_on".
3. Right-click the date field.
4. Select **Change Data Type** > **Date & Time**.

5. Repeat for other necessary date fields.
6. Verify that date comparisons and calculations now work correctly.
</Steps>

## Alternative Sharing Methods

### Method 2: Create a Data Extract with Filtering

You want more control? Filter your data before sharing:

<Steps>
1. Create a Tableau Data Extract (.tde or .hyper file)
2. Apply filters to limit exposed data
3. Save and share the workbook with the extract
</Steps>

### Method 3: Use Tableau Server or Tableau Online

Got Tableau Server? This is your best bet for enterprise sharing:

<Steps>
1. Publish the workbook to Tableau Server/Online
2. Set appropriate user permissions
3. Allow recipients to access through a browser
4. Enable or disable download capabilities as needed
</Steps>

### Method 4: Export Dashboards as PDF/PNG

Need a quick share without any connectivity hassles? Export to static files:

<Steps>
1. Select **Dashboard** > **Export**
2. Choose PDF or Image format
3. Share the static file with recipients
</Steps>

## Best Practices for Workbook Sharing

A few things to remember:
- Remove unnecessary sheets and dashboards before sharing
- Document required data sources and connection steps
- Test the reconnection process before sharing
- Consider creating a template with sample data for demonstration
- Remove any sensitive calculations or parameters

That's it! You can now share Tableau visualizations while keeping your Tallyfy data completely secure - your recipients just connect their own data sources and they're ready to go.
