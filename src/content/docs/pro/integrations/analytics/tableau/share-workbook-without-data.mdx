## Sharing Tableau workbooks without exposing Tallyfy data

Disconnect your Tallyfy Analytics data sources before sharing a Tableau workbook - recipients get all your visualizations and dashboard layouts, but connect their own credentials. Your connection details stay private.

### Sharing methods at a glance

| Method | Best for | Data protection |
|--------|----------|-----------------|
| Data source disconnection | One-time sharing | Medium - structure visible, data removed |
| Filtered data extract | Recurring sharing | High - only selected data included |
| Tableau Server / Tableau Cloud | Team collaboration | High - centralized permission control |
| PDF/PNG export | Quick, read-only sharing | Complete - no data connectivity at all |

### Before you start

- Tableau Desktop installed
- Working Tallyfy Analytics connection in Tableau
- Visualizations and dashboards already built

## Method 1: Disconnect data sources

This approach strips your data while preserving the workbook structure. Recipients reconnect with their own credentials.

### Prepare your workbook

Confirm your Tableau workbook contains all the visualizations and dashboards you want to share.

### Disconnect the data sources

<Steps>
1. In the **Data** pane, right-click each data source
2. Select **Close** to remove the connection
</Steps>

Alternatively, you can redirect the connection instead of closing it:
<Steps>
1. Go to the **Data Source** tab
2. Click the dropdown for each data source
3. Select **Edit Connection**

</Steps>

### Save and share

<Steps>
1. Select **File** > **Save As** to preserve your original workbook
2. Give the copy a descriptive name (e.g., "Dashboard - no data")
3. Share the saved .twb file with your recipients
</Steps>

### What recipients see when they open it

Recipients will see connection errors when they open the workbook - that's expected:

They can click to see full error details:

To reconnect their own data:

<Steps>
1. Click **Yes** when prompted to connect to data

2. Select **Edit Connection** and enter their own Tallyfy Analytics credentials

3. If **Edit Connection** doesn't work, remove the existing connection and create a new one

4. Once connected, the dashboard populates with their data
</Steps>

## Fixing data types after reconnection

After reconnecting, date fields like `due_by` and `completed_on` sometimes need their data types reset. This takes about two minutes:

<Steps>
1. Open the **Data Source** tab
2. Find the date fields (e.g., `due_by`, `completed_on`)
3. Right-click the field and select **Change Data Type** > **Date & Time**

    ![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tableu-share-workbook-12.png)
4. Repeat for any other date fields
5. Verify that date-based calculations and comparisons work correctly
</Steps>

## Other sharing methods

### Method 2: Share a filtered data extract

Want to include some data but not everything? Create a filtered extract:

<Steps>
1. Create a Tableau Data Extract (.hyper file)
2. Apply filters to limit which rows and columns are included
3. Save and share the workbook with the embedded extract
</Steps>

### Method 3: Publish to Tableau Server or Tableau Cloud

For enterprise-grade sharing with role-based access control:

<Steps>
1. Publish the workbook to Tableau Server or Tableau Cloud
2. Set user permissions to control who sees what
3. Recipients access dashboards through their browser
4. Enable or disable download capabilities as needed
</Steps>

### Method 4: Export as PDF or PNG

For a quick, read-only share with no data connectivity:

<Steps>
1. Select **Dashboard** > **Export**
2. Choose PDF or Image format
3. Share the static file
</Steps>

## Best practices

- Remove unnecessary sheets and dashboards before sharing
- Document which data sources recipients need and how to connect
- Test the reconnection process yourself before sending
- Strip out sensitive calculations or parameters
- Consider including sample data so recipients can verify the layout works
