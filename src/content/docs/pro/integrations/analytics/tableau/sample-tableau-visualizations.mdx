## Ready-to-use Tableau charts for Tallyfy data

Here are 10 Tableau visualizations you can build from Tallyfy Analytics data. Each one answers specific business questions using your process, task, and form field data.

:::tip[Elapsed time vs. actual effort]
These charts show elapsed time based on task timestamps - including weekends, holidays, and idle periods. For actual effort tracking, see [how to track time spent on tasks](/products/pro/tutorials/how-to/track-time-in-tasks/).
:::

### Time performance

#### 1. Task on-time completion rates

A pie chart breaking down tasks into on-time vs. late based on due dates and completion timestamps. Useful for quarterly reviews.

**Questions this answers:**
- What percentage of tasks finish on schedule?
- Are our due dates realistic?

#### 2. User timeliness comparison

A bar chart comparing on-time rates across team members. Spot who consistently hits deadlines - and who might need support.

**Questions this answers:**
- Which team members meet deadlines most often?
- Who might benefit from workload adjustments or deadline changes?

#### 3. Timeliness trend over time

Track whether on-time completion is improving or declining week over week. Helpful for measuring the impact of process changes.

**Questions this answers:**
- Is timeliness trending up or down?
- Did a specific process change improve performance?

### Workload and activity

#### 4. Process ownership distribution

See how many processes each user owns. Quickly identify uneven workload distribution.

**Questions this answers:**
- Who completes the most tasks?
- Is workload distributed evenly?

#### 6. Task-specific timeliness

A heatmap showing which specific steps in your processes run late most often. Darker colors mean more delays - these are the steps worth redesigning.

**Questions this answers:**
- Which steps consistently cause delays?
- Are there steps that need redesigning or clearer instructions?

#### 7. Process template usage

Shows how often each template gets launched. Identifies your most-used processes and templates that might be candidates for retirement.

**Questions this answers:**
- Which templates are launched most frequently?
- Are there templates that should be retired or consolidated?

#### 8. Daily task completion activity

A time-series chart of daily task completions. Reveals patterns like Monday spikes or Friday slowdowns.

![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tableau-samples-7.jpg)

**Questions this answers:**
- Are there day-of-week patterns in task completion?
- Do we see consistent throughput or significant fluctuations?

### Process quality

#### 9. Comment frequency analysis

High comment volume on specific tasks usually signals confusion. This chart pinpoints which steps generate the most discussion.

![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tableau-samples-8.jpg)

**Questions this answers:**
- Which tasks need the most clarification?
- Where should you improve step instructions or documentation?

#### 10. Issue frequency by task

Ranks tasks by how often they generate reported issues. Fix the top offenders first for the biggest improvement.

**Questions this answers:**
- Which tasks consistently produce problems?
