## Tableau Visualization Examples for Workflow Analysis

Want to see what Tallyfy Analytics data looks like in Tableau? Here are 10 ready-to-use visualizations that answer real business questions about your workflows.

### Visualization Benefits

- **Identify Bottlenecks** - Pinpoint where processes slow down
- **Track Performance** - Monitor individual and team productivity
- **Recognize Patterns** - Discover trends in workflow execution
- **Measure Compliance** - Track adherence to deadlines and requirements
- **Optimize Resources** - Ensure balanced workload distribution

### Time Performance Visualizations

:::tip[Measuring actual work time]
These visualizations show elapsed time based on task timestamps. For tracking actual effort time (how long someone actively worked on a task), see [how to track time spent on tasks](/products/pro/tutorials/how-to/track-time-in-tasks/) - this gives you cleaner data that accounts for multi-tasking, holidays, and external delays.
