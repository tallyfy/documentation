## How to connect Tableau to your Tallyfy Analytics data

In this article, we'll show you how to connect Tableau to your Tallyfy process data with the help of the Amazon Athena connector - which is where all the data is hosted.

Amazon offers a couple of ways to connect to their internal resources:

* IAM username and password
* Token-based authentication i.e. an Access Key

The first and most important point about integrating to PowerBI is that unlike Tableau and other BI tools - we've found that it's a lot easier to use token-based authentication for this purpose. If you try connecting with the IAM method to Amazon Athena from Power BI via ODBC - you get an error like this quite often:

> The security token included in the request is invalid

Tallyfy will create and provision the token-based credentials you need as part of the provisioning process for Tallyfy Analytics.

## Important note

When you provision Tallyfy Analytics you will receive two sets of credentials.

* The _AWS IAM login_ is only used to access the AWS console on the web
* The _Access Key_ and _Secret Access Key_ is what you need to connect to the Athena database with BI tools

## Token-based connection to AWS Athena

You will be given the following from Tallyfy **as a substitute** for your IAM username and password:

* Access key
* Secret access key

In general - regular IAM user credentials (username + password) should be used only to access resources via AWS console - https://aws.amazon.com/

For all other integrations (just like this ODBC driver) the external service access keys (Access Key and Secret Access Key) should be used.

## Get the appropriate drivers

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed on your computer:

1. 64-bit Java - Download it from [here](https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp).
2. The JDBC driver - Download it from [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/connect-with-jdbc.html).

Refer to the latest AWS documentation on how to connect to Athena via your BI tool as well, to double check the latest updates.

Remember to save the JDBC driver in the correct directory:

- On Windows: C:\Program Files\Tableau\Drivers.
- On Mac: ~/Library/Tableau/Drivers.

## Connect Tableau to Tallyfy data in Amazon Athena

1. Open Tableau Desktop and click on "Connect to Data".
2. Select "Amazon Athena" from the options.
3. A dialogue box will appear where you'll enter your Tallyfy credentials including your Access Key ID and Secret Access Key. This ensures secure access to your organization's files.
4. Click "Sign In" and voila! Tableau is now connected to your Tallyfy process data.

## Load and analyze your data via SQL

1. To load the data, select "AwsDataCatalog" under Catalog.
2. Then, choose your database under Database.
3. Drag and drop your desired data table into the workspace.
4. Now, you're ready to slice, dice, and report on your process data to your heart's content!
