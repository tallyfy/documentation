## Connect Tableau to your Tallyfy Analytics data

Connect Tableau to Tallyfy Analytics through Amazon Athena[^1] in about 15 minutes. Once connected, you can build visual dashboards from your workflow data - process durations, task completion rates, form field answers, and member activity.

### Requirements

- Tallyfy Analytics subscription activated for your organization
- Tableau Desktop installed
- Admin access to your computer (for driver installation)
- Access Key credentials from Tallyfy Support

## Authentication overview

Tallyfy provisions two separate credential sets for Analytics:

| Credential type | Use for |
|--------|----------|
| IAM Username/Password | AWS web console access only |
| Access Key + Secret Access Key | Tableau and other BI tool connections (recommended) |

:::caution[Use the right credentials]
For Tableau, always use **Access Key + Secret Access Key** - not your IAM console login. Token-based authentication avoids "security token invalid" errors that happen with console credentials.
:::

## Setup process

### Step 1 - Install required drivers

<Steps>
1. Download and install **64-bit Java** from [Java's official site](https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp/). The JDBC connection requires it.
2. Download the **Amazon Athena JDBC Driver** from the [AWS Athena JDBC documentation page](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/connect-with-jdbc.html/).
3. Place the downloaded driver in Tableau's driver directory: `C:\\Program Files\\Tableau\\Drivers` on Windows or `~/Library/Tableau/Drivers` on macOS.
</Steps>

:::note[Driver updates]
AWS updates their JDBC drivers periodically. Check their documentation for the latest version to avoid compatibility issues.
:::

### Step 2 - Configure Tableau connection

<Steps>
1. Launch Tableau Desktop.
2. Click **Connect** > **To a Server** > **Amazon Athena**.
3. Enter the **Server** - use the Athena endpoint for your region (e.g., `athena.us-east-1.amazonaws.com` or `athena.us-west-2.amazonaws.com`). Tallyfy Support will confirm your region.
4. Enter the **Port** (`443`).
5. Enter the **S3 Staging Directory** provided by Tallyfy (e.g., `s3://tallyfy-athena-results/`). This is where Athena stores temporary query results.
6. Enter your Tallyfy-provided **Access Key ID**.
7. Enter your Tallyfy-provided **Secret Access Key**.
8. Enter the **Region** matching your server endpoint.
9. Click **Sign In**.
</Steps>

### Step 3 - Access Tallyfy data

<Steps>
1. Select **AwsDataCatalog** from the Catalog dropdown.
2. Select your assigned database (typically your organization name) from the Database dropdown.
3. You'll see available tables containing your workflow data.
4. Drag tables into your workspace to start building visualizations.
</Steps>

## Working with Tallyfy data in Tableau

### Available data

Tallyfy Analytics data includes detailed information across these areas:

- **Process data** - template names, process status, ownership, and completion progress
- **Task data** - assignments, due dates, completion timestamps, and task status per step
- **Form field data** - questions, answers, and field types collected during workflows
- **Member data** - user profiles, activity timestamps, roles, and login history

Each process run is exported as a denormalized dataset - meaning process, task, and form field details are combined into a single flat structure. This makes it straightforward to build dashboards without complex joins.

### Visualization ideas

Here are the most common dashboards Tallyfy customers build:

1. **Process duration charts** - identify where workflows get stuck (durations show elapsed time, not effort)
2. **User performance scorecards** - task completion rates and average handling times
3. **Form data trends** - patterns in customer requests or quality submissions
4. **Process status monitors** - current state of active workflows

:::caution[Interpreting time metrics]
Duration and handling time metrics show elapsed calendar time between task assignment and completion. This includes weekends, holidays, and waiting periods. For actual effort tracking, see [how to track time spent on tasks](/products/pro/tutorials/how-to/track-time-in-tasks/#analytics-timestamps-inherit-these-challenges).

## Troubleshooting connection issues

If your connection fails, check these in order:

- Verify your Access Key and Secret Access Key are correct - a single wrong character breaks the connection
- Confirm the JDBC driver is in the correct folder (`C:\\Program Files\\Tableau\\Drivers` or `~/Library/Tableau/Drivers`)
- Test network connectivity to the Athena endpoint - corporate firewalls sometimes block it
- Confirm your Tallyfy Analytics subscription is active
- Restart Tableau after installing drivers (required for Tableau to detect new drivers)

Still stuck? Contact Tallyfy Support with the exact error message.
