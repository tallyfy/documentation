## Connecting Tableau to Tallyfy Analytics

This guide explains how to connect Tableau to your Tallyfy process data through Amazon Athena, allowing you to create visualizations and reports based on your workflow information.

### Requirements

Before beginning the connection process, ensure you have:

- Tallyfy Analytics subscription activated for your organization
- Tableau Desktop installed (version 10.0 or higher)
- Administrative access to your computer for driver installation
- Authentication credentials provided by Tallyfy Support

## Authentication Overview

Amazon Athena (which hosts Tallyfy Analytics data) offers two authentication methods:

| Method | Description | Best For |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| IAM Username/Password | Web console access credentials | AWS Console access only |
| Access Key/Secret | Token-based authentication | BI tool connections (recommended) |

:::caution[Important Note]
When Tallyfy provisions your Analytics account, you will receive two distinct credential sets:
- **AWS IAM login** - Use only for accessing the AWS web console 
- **Access Key + Secret Access Key** - Use for connecting Tableau and other BI tools
:::

Token-based authentication (Access Key + Secret Access Key) is strongly recommended for Tableau connections as it provides more reliable access and avoids common authentication errors like "The security token included in the request is invalid."

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Install Required Drivers

Before configuring Tableau, you must install:

<Steps>
1. Download and install **64-bit Java** from [Java's official site](https://java.com/en/download/manual.jsp/), following the on-screen prompts. This is required for the JDBC connection.
2. Download the **Amazon Athena JDBC Driver** from the [AWS Athena JDBC documentation page](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/connect-with-jdbc.html/).
3. Install the downloaded driver in the appropriate Tableau driver directory: `C:\\Program Files\\Tableau\\Drivers` for Windows or `~/Library/Tableau/Drivers` for macOS.
</Steps>

:::note[Driver Updates]
Always refer to the latest AWS documentation for the most current driver versions and installation instructions, as these may change over time.
:::

### Step 2: Configure Tableau Connection

<Steps>
1. Launch Tableau Desktop.
2. Click **Connect** > **To a Server** > **Amazon Athena**.
3. In the connection dialog, enter the **Server** (`athena.us-east-1.amazonaws.com` or your specific region).
4. Enter the **Port** (`443`).
5. Enter the **S3 Staging Directory** provided by Tallyfy (e.g., `s3://tallyfy-athena-results/`).
6. Enter your Tallyfy-provided **Access Key ID**.
7. Enter your Tallyfy-provided **Secret Access Key**.
8. Enter the **Region** (`us-east-1` or your specific region).
9. Click **Sign In**.
</Steps>

## Working with Tallyfy Data in Tableau

### Available Data Tables

Tallyfy Analytics makes several core tables available:

- **processes** - Completed and in-progress workflow instances
- **steps** - Individual task data within processes
- **form_fields** - Form field values collected during workflows
- **users** - User activity and participation metrics

### Creating Effective Visualizations

With your Tallyfy data connected, you can:

1. Create process duration visualizations to identify bottlenecks
2. Build user performance dashboards showing task completion metrics
3. Analyze form field data to extract valuable business insights
4. Establish real-time monitoring of active processes

## Troubleshooting Connection Issues

If you encounter connection problems:

- Verify your Access Key and Secret Access Key are entered correctly
- Ensure the JDBC driver is installed in the correct location
- Check that your computer can access the athena.us-east-1.amazonaws.com endpoint
- Confirm your Tallyfy Analytics subscription is active
- Restart Tableau after installing or updating drivers
