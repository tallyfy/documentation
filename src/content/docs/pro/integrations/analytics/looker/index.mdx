## Looker Integration with Tallyfy Analytics

Want to turn workflow data into interactive insights your whole team can explore? Looker connects directly to Tallyfy Analytics, transforming raw process information into dashboards that answer questions you didn't even know you had.

:::note[Looker vs Looker Studio]
This guide covers both **Looker** (Google Cloud's enterprise BI platform) and **Looker Studio** (free visualization tool, formerly Google Data Studio). Both integrate with Tallyfy Analytics through Amazon Athena, but use different connection methods. Choose the one that matches your needs and budget.
:::

### Integration Benefits

- **Interactive Data Exploration** - Click, filter, and drill down through your workflow data without writing queries
- **Embedded Analytics** - Share live dashboards with stakeholders who don't need full BI tool access
- **Real-time Monitoring** - Watch processes unfold with dashboards that update as work happens
- **Collaborative Intelligence** - Build once, share everywhere - from Slack to email to web portals
- **Self-Service Analytics** - Empower team members to answer their own questions without IT bottlenecks

### Key Capabilities

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Live Connectivity | Direct connection to Tallyfy data via Amazon Athena[^1] |
| LookML Modeling | Define relationships and calculations once, use everywhere |
| Embedded Dashboards | Integrate analytics into your existing applications |
| Scheduled Delivery | Email reports automatically on your schedule |
| Mobile Access | Access insights from any device, anywhere |

### Business Applications

Here's what you can actually build with Looker and Tallyfy together:

1. **Executive Dashboards** - Give leadership the 10,000-foot view with drill-down into details
2. **Process Performance Monitoring** - Spot bottlenecks before they become problems
3. **Team Analytics** - See who's crushing their tasks and who needs support
4. **Customer Journey Analysis** - Track how form submissions flow through your processes
5. **Compliance Reporting** - Prove you're meeting SLAs with timestamp evidence
6. **Workload Distribution** - Balance assignments across your team based on real data

### Technical Architecture

The connection works through a straightforward chain:

- **Tallyfy Analytics** - Your process data stored securely in Amazon S3
- **Amazon Athena** - Query engine that runs SQL on your data lake
- **Simba JDBC Driver** - The bridge connecting Looker to Athena
- **Looker Platform** - Where you build models and create visualizations
- **Looker API** - Embed dashboards anywhere you need them

### Authentication Requirements

When Tallyfy provisions your Analytics account, you'll receive two credential sets. Keep them straight:

- **AWS IAM Login** (username/password) - For AWS web console access only
- **Access Key and Secret Access Key** - Your credentials for Looker connections

:::note[Important]
Looker needs the Access Key and Secret Access Key - not the IAM username/password. Token-based authentication works better with BI platforms and avoids those frustrating "security token invalid" errors.
:::

### Performance Optimization

Looker offers some neat tricks for working with Athena data:

- **Result Streaming** - Large result sets? Enable streaming to improve extraction speed
- **Persistent Derived Tables** - Cache complex calculations in S3 for faster dashboard loading
- **Connection Pooling** - Increase concurrent connections if Looker is your primary analytics tool
- **Query Optimization** - Use Looker's aggregate awareness to pre-calculate common metrics

:::tip[Understanding time metrics]
Task duration metrics in Looker show elapsed time between assignment and completion - not actual working time. These timestamps include holidays, multi-tasking periods, and external delays.
