## Connecting Looker to Tallyfy Analytics

Looker connects to Tallyfy Analytics through Amazon Athena, letting you build interactive dashboards from your workflow data. Your whole team can click, filter, and drill into process performance - no SQL required.

:::note[Looker vs Looker Studio]
This covers both **Looker** (Google Cloud's enterprise BI platform) and **Looker Studio** (free visualization tool, formerly Google Data Studio). Both connect to Tallyfy Analytics through Amazon Athena using different methods. Pick whichever fits your needs and budget.
:::

### What you can build

- **Interactive exploration** - Filter and drill down through workflow data without writing queries
- **Embedded dashboards** - Share live analytics with stakeholders who don't need full BI access
- **Real-time monitoring** - Watch processes unfold with dashboards that update as work happens
- **Executive overviews** - Give leadership a high-level view with drill-down into details
- **Bottleneck detection** - Spot slowdowns in your processes before they become problems
- **Compliance reporting** - Prove SLA compliance with timestamp evidence

### How the connection works

| Layer | Role |
|-------|------|
| Tallyfy Analytics | Your process data stored in Amazon S3 |
| Amazon Athena[^1] | Query engine that runs SQL on your data lake |
| Simba JDBC driver | Connects Looker to Athena |
| Looker | Build models, create visualizations, embed dashboards |

### Authentication

When Tallyfy provisions your Analytics account, you'll get two credential sets:

- **AWS IAM Login** (username/password) - For AWS web console access only
- **Access Key and Secret Access Key** - What Looker actually needs for the connection

:::note[Important]
Looker needs the Access Key and Secret Access Key - not the IAM username/password. Token-based authentication works better with BI platforms and avoids "security token invalid" errors.
:::

### Performance tips

- **Result streaming** - Enable streaming for large result sets to improve extraction speed
- **Persistent derived tables** - Cache complex calculations in S3 for faster dashboard loading
- **Connection pooling** - Increase concurrent connections if Looker is your primary analytics tool
- **Aggregate awareness** - Pre-calculate common metrics so dashboards load faster

:::tip[Understanding time metrics]
Task duration metrics in Looker show elapsed time between assignment and completion - not actual working time. These timestamps include holidays, multi-tasking periods, and external delays. For accurate effort tracking, see [how to track time spent on tasks](/products/pro/tutorials/how-to/track-time-in-tasks/#analytics-timestamps-inherit-these-challenges).
