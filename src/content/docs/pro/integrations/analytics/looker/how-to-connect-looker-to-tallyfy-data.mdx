## Connect Looker to Tallyfy data

You can connect Looker to Tallyfy's analytics data through Amazon Athena in about 15-20 minutes. Tallyfy exports your workflow data as Parquet files (with Snappy compression) to S3, and Athena lets Looker query that data directly - so you can build LookML models and dashboards from real process metrics.

:::note[Looker vs Looker Studio]
This guide covers **Looker** (Google Cloud's enterprise BI platform). For **Looker Studio** (the free visualization tool), see the [Looker Studio connection guide](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/looker/how-to-connect-looker-studio-to-tallyfy-data/) instead.
:::

### Requirements

Before you start, confirm you have:

- Tallyfy Analytics enabled for your organization (the `analytics_enabled` flag must be active)
- Looker access - either self-hosted or Looker Cloud
- Admin permissions in Looker to create database connections
- Admin access to your machine for driver installation (self-hosted only)
- AWS Access Key credentials from Tallyfy Support

## Authentication overview

Athena supports two authentication methods. For Looker, you want Access Keys.

| Method | Description | Best for |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| IAM Username/Password | Web console access credentials | AWS Console access only |
| Access Key/Secret | Token-based authentication | BI tool connections (recommended) |

:::caution[Two separate credential sets]
Tallyfy provisions two credential sets when activating Analytics:
- **AWS IAM login** - for the AWS web console only
- **Access Key + Secret Access Key** - for connecting Looker and other BI tools

Use the Access Keys for Looker. Token-based auth avoids "security token invalid" errors that plague console-credential connections.
:::

## Setup process

### Step 1: Install the JDBC driver (self-hosted Looker only)

Using Looker Cloud? Skip ahead - Google pre-installs the Athena drivers. For self-hosted instances:

<Steps>
1. Download the **Simba Athena JDBC Driver** from the [AWS Athena JDBC documentation page](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/connect-with-jdbc.html/).
2. Place the driver in your Looker JDBC directory (typically `/usr/local/looker/looker/lib/custom/`)
3. Restart Looker to load the new driver
</Steps>

:::note[Driver versions]
AWS provides 2.x and 3.x JDBC drivers. The 3.x driver handles large result sets better. Use the latest 3.x unless you have compatibility constraints.
:::

### Step 2: Configure the Looker connection

<Steps>
1. Log into Looker as an administrator
2. Go to **Admin** > **Database** > **Connections**
3. Click **Add Connection**
4. Select **Amazon Athena** as the dialect
5. Fill in the connection parameters:
   - **Name**: Something descriptive (e.g., "Tallyfy Analytics")
   - **Host**: `athena.us-east-1.amazonaws.com` (Tallyfy's default AWS region is us-east-1)
   - **Port**: `443`
   - **Database**: Your assigned database name (typically your organization name)
   - **Username**: Your Access Key ID from Tallyfy
   - **Password**: Your Secret Access Key from Tallyfy
6. In **Additional Params**, add:
   ```text
   s3_staging_dir=s3://your-staging-bucket/looker-results/
   ```
7. Click **Test** to verify the connection
8. If the test passes, click **Connect**
</Steps>

:::tip[S3 staging directory]
Athena stores query results in this S3 location. Tallyfy Support provides the path when provisioning your Analytics account. Your Access Key needs write permissions to this bucket.
:::

### Step 3: Tune performance settings

<Steps>
1. In the connection settings, find **Additional Params**
2. Append these performance parameters:
   ```text
   ;UseResultsetStreaming=1;MaxConcurrentQueries=20
   ```
3. **UseResultsetStreaming=1** enables streaming for large result sets (requires the `athena:GetQueryResultsStream` IAM policy)
4. **MaxConcurrentQueries=20** increases the connection pool for heavier usage
5. Save the connection settings
</Steps>

:::note[Connection pooling]
Default is 5 concurrent connections. If Looker is your primary Tallyfy analytics tool, raise this to 10-20. For occasional exploration, 5 is fine.
:::

### Step 4: Set up temp database for PDTs

Persistent Derived Tables (PDTs)[^1] cache complex calculations so dashboards load faster:

<Steps>
1. In your connection settings, find **Temp Database**
2. Enter the S3 directory path: `tallyfy-athena-results/looker-pdts/`
3. Looker stores pre-calculated tables here for reuse
4. Save the settings
</Steps>

## Working with Tallyfy data in Looker

### Available data

Tallyfy Analytics exports two categories of data to S3 as Parquet files:

- **Run analytics** - per-process data including process metadata (blueprint name, status, owner), task details (assignments, completion dates, due dates), form field values (questions and answers), comments, and issue tracking
- **Members** - user activity and profile data (email, name, role, login history, status)

These are organized per-organization in S3, and Athena tables may present this data across views for processes, steps, form fields, and users.

### Building a LookML model

Here's a basic starting point:

<Steps>
1. In Looker, go to **Develop** > **LookML Projects**
2. Create a new project or pick an existing one
3. Create a model file with your connection:
   ```yaml
   connection: "tallyfy_analytics"

   explore: processes {
     join: steps {
       sql_on: ${processes.process_id} = ${steps.process_id} ;;
       relationship: one_to_many
     }
   }
   ```
4. Create view files for each data table
5. Define dimensions and measures based on your business needs
</Steps>

### Dashboard ideas

Some practical dashboards you can build from Tallyfy data:

1. **Process duration analysis** - find where workflows get stuck (durations show elapsed time, not effort)
2. **Team performance scorecards** - completion rates and average handling times per user
3. **Form data analytics** - spot trends in customer requests or quality issues
4. **Active process monitors** - real-time view of running processes and their current status
5. **SLA compliance tracking** - measure whether tasks complete within target timeframes

:::caution[Interpreting time metrics]
Duration metrics show elapsed calendar time between task assignment and completion - including weekends, holidays, and waiting periods. For actual effort tracking, see [how to track time spent on tasks](/products/pro/tutorials/how-to/track-time-in-tasks/#analytics-timestamps-inherit-these-challenges).

## Advanced features

### Embedding Looker dashboards

The Looker API lets you share insights outside Looker itself:

- Embed dashboards in internal portals or wikis
- Share via Slack using Looker's Slack integration
- Schedule email delivery of reports
- Create public dashboards with controlled access

### Query optimization

A few ways to keep queries fast:

- **Aggregate awareness** - pre-calculate common metrics in PDTs
- **Incremental PDTs** - only recalculate changed data
- **Push filters to Athena** - filter at the query level rather than post-processing in Looker
- **Monitor query performance** - use Looker's Query History to find slow queries

## Troubleshooting

Connection not working? Check these in order:

- Double-check your Access Key and Secret Access Key - one wrong character breaks the connection
- Verify the S3 staging directory path is correct and your credentials have write access
- Confirm the JDBC driver is installed properly (self-hosted only)
- Test that Looker can reach `athena.us-east-1.amazonaws.com` on port 443
- Verify your Tallyfy Analytics subscription is active
- Enable debug logging by adding `;LogLevel=DEBUG;LogPath=/tmp/athena_debug.log` to **Additional Params**, then check `/tmp/athena_debug.log` for details

Still stuck? Contact Tallyfy Support with the exact error message.
