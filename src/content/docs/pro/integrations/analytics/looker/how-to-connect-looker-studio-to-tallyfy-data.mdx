## How can I connect Looker Studio to my Tallyfy data?

You can connect Looker Studio (formerly Google Data Studio) to Tallyfy in about 10-15 minutes using a third-party connector. Once connected, you'll create free, shareable dashboards and reports from your workflow data without paying for an enterprise BI platform.

:::note[Looker Studio vs Looker]
This guide covers **Looker Studio** (the free visualization tool). Looking for **Looker** (Google Cloud's enterprise BI platform)? Check out the [Looker connection guide](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/looker/how-to-connect-looker-to-tallyfy-data/) instead.
:::

### Requirements

Before you start, make sure you have:

- Tallyfy Analytics subscription activated for your organization
- Free Looker Studio account (sign up at [lookerstudio.google.com](https://lookerstudio.google.com))
- Authentication credentials provided by Tallyfy Support
- Third-party connector subscription (CData or OWOX)

:::caution[No Native Athena Support]
Unlike the enterprise Looker platform, Looker Studio doesn't have built-in Amazon Athena connectivity. You'll need a third-party connector to bridge the gap. The good news? Setup is still quick and straightforward.
:::

## Authentication Overview

Amazon Athena (which hosts Tallyfy Analytics data) offers two authentication methods:

| Method | Description | Best For |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| IAM Username/Password | Web console access credentials | AWS Console access only |
| Access Key/Secret | Token-based authentication | Connector authentication (recommended) |

:::caution[Important Note]
When Tallyfy provisions your Analytics account, you'll receive two distinct credential sets:
- **AWS IAM login** - Use only for accessing the AWS web console
- **Access Key + Secret Access Key** - Use for connecting Looker Studio connectors
:::

## Connector Options

Two reliable connectors support Athena-to-Looker Studio integration:

### Option 1: CData Connect Cloud

**Best For**: Organizations needing robust data connectivity with minimal setup

- **Pricing**: Subscription-based (check [CData pricing](https://www.cdata.com/pricing/))
- **Setup Time**: 10-15 minutes
- **Features**: Direct cloud-to-cloud connectivity, automatic query optimization, no data replication
- **Support**: Enterprise-grade technical support

### Option 2: OWOX BI Connector

**Best For**: Marketing teams already using OWOX for analytics

- **Pricing**: Part of OWOX BI suite (check [OWOX pricing](https://www.owox.com/products/athena-to-looker-studio-connector))
- **Setup Time**: 10-15 minutes
- **Features**: Seamless AWS integration, no intermediate processing steps
- **Support**: Email and documentation support

:::tip[Choosing a Connector]
Both connectors work well with Tallyfy Analytics. Choose CData if you need broader data connectivity options beyond Athena. Choose OWOX if you're already in their ecosystem for marketing analytics.

## Working with Tallyfy Data in Looker Studio

### Available Data Tables

Tallyfy Analytics provides four main tables:

- **processes** - Completed and in-progress workflow instances with start/end times
- **steps** - Individual task data within processes including assignments and durations
- **form_fields** - Form field values collected during workflows
- **users** - User activity and participation metrics across all processes

### Creating Effective Visualizations

What can you actually build? Here are popular dashboards our customers create:

1. **Process Volume Trends** - Line charts showing processes launched over time
2. **Completion Rate Scorecards** - Big numbers showing percentage of on-time completions
3. **Task Duration Heatmaps** - Identify bottlenecks by visualizing average task durations
4. **User Activity Tables** - Leaderboards showing top performers by completion rate
5. **Form Response Analysis** - Pivot tables and charts exploring form field data patterns

:::caution[Interpreting time metrics]
Duration and handling time metrics show elapsed calendar time between task assignment and completion. This includes weekends, holidays, and waiting periods. For actual effort tracking, see [how to track time spent on tasks](/products/pro/tutorials/how-to/track-time-in-tasks/#analytics-timestamps-inherit-these-challenges).

## Performance Tips

Make your Looker Studio reports faster:

- **Use Date Range Controls** - Don't pull all historical data every time
- **Apply Filters Early** - Filter at the data source level, not in charts
- **Limit Table Rows** - Show top 10 or 20, not thousands of rows
- **Cache Reports** - Enable data freshness caching (reports update every 12-24 hours)
- **Optimize Queries** - Pre-aggregate data in Athena views when possible

:::tip[Data Freshness]
Looker Studio caches data to improve performance. If you need real-time data, adjust the data freshness setting in your data source configuration. For most workflow analytics, daily updates work perfectly fine.
:::

## Sharing and Collaboration

One of Looker Studio's best features? Sharing is dead simple:

- **View Access** - Share report URLs with anyone who needs to see insights
- **Edit Access** - Let team members modify reports and create new visualizations
- **Embed Reports** - Drop reports into websites or internal portals with iframe embeds
- **Schedule Emails** - Auto-send report snapshots on your preferred schedule
- **Mobile Friendly** - All reports work great on phones and tablets

## Troubleshooting Connection Issues

Connection not working? Let's fix it. Check these things in order:

- **Verify Credentials** - Double-check your Access Key and Secret Access Key (even one wrong character breaks everything)
- **Check Permissions** - Ensure your credentials have `AmazonAthenaFullAccess` and `AmazonS3FullAccess` policies attached
- **Validate S3 Path** - Confirm your S3 staging directory path is exactly as provided by Tallyfy
- **Test in AWS Console** - Try running a query in the Athena web console to rule out credential issues
- **Check Connector Status** - Verify your CData or OWOX subscription is active
- **Review Region Settings** - Ensure you're using the correct AWS region (typically `us-east-1`)

Still stuck? Contact your connector provider's support team first (they'll diagnose connection issues), then reach out to Tallyfy Support if the issue appears to be with your Analytics account.

## Cost Considerations

Let's talk money - what does this setup actually cost?

| Component | Cost | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Looker Studio | **Free** | Unlimited reports and dashboards |
| Tallyfy Analytics | Subscription | Contact Tallyfy for pricing |
| CData Connect Cloud | Subscription | Starts around $49/month |
| OWOX Connector | Subscription | Part of OWOX BI suite pricing |
| AWS Query Costs | Pay-per-query | Typically $5-10/month for normal usage |

:::tip[Optimizing AWS Costs]
Athena charges based on data scanned. Reduce costs by:
- Using date range filters in reports
- Partitioning data by date (Tallyfy does this automatically)
- Caching report data in Looker Studio
- Limiting the number of columns you query
:::

## Comparison: Looker Studio vs Enterprise Looker
