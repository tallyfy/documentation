## Connect Looker Studio to Tallyfy data

Looker Studio connects to Tallyfy Analytics through a third-party connector in about 10-15 minutes. You get free, shareable dashboards from your workflow data - no enterprise BI license needed.

:::note[Looker Studio vs Looker]
This guide covers **Looker Studio** (the free visualization tool). For **Looker** (Google Cloud's enterprise BI platform), see the [Looker connection guide](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/looker/how-to-connect-looker-to-tallyfy-data/) instead.
:::

### Requirements

Before you start, you'll need:

- Tallyfy Analytics subscription activated for your organization
- Free Looker Studio account (sign up at [lookerstudio.google.com](https://lookerstudio.google.com))
- AWS Access Key credentials from Tallyfy Support
- A third-party connector subscription (CData or OWOX)

:::caution[No native Athena support]
Looker Studio lacks built-in Amazon Athena connectivity, unlike enterprise Looker. A third-party connector bridges the gap. Setup is still quick.
:::

## Authentication overview

Tallyfy Analytics data lives in Amazon Athena, which supports two authentication methods:

| Method | Description | Use for |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| IAM Username/Password | Web console access credentials | AWS Console only |
| Access Key/Secret | Token-based authentication | Connector authentication (recommended) |

:::caution[Two separate credential sets]
Tallyfy provisions two distinct credential sets:
- **AWS IAM login** - for the AWS web console only
- **Access Key + Secret Access Key** - for connecting Looker Studio connectors
:::

## Connector options

Two connectors work well for Athena-to-Looker Studio integration:

### Option 1: CData Connect Cloud

- **Pricing**: Subscription-based (check [CData pricing](https://www.cdata.com/pricing/))
- **Setup time**: 10-15 minutes
- **Highlights**: Cloud-to-cloud connectivity, automatic query optimization, no data replication

### Option 2: OWOX BI connector

- **Pricing**: Free (check [OWOX connector page](https://www.owox.com/products/athena-to-looker-studio-connector))
- **Setup time**: 10-15 minutes
- **Highlights**: Direct AWS integration, no intermediate processing

:::tip[Choosing a connector]
Both work well with Tallyfy Analytics. Pick CData if you need broader data connectivity beyond Athena. Pick OWOX if you're already in their platform.

## Working with Tallyfy data in Looker Studio

### Available data

Tallyfy Analytics exports your workflow data as Parquet files[^1] to Amazon S3, which Athena then makes queryable. The data covers:

- **Process data** - Workflow instances with status, owner, template name/version, tags, and completion timestamps
- **Task data** - Individual tasks within processes including assignments, due dates, and completion status
- **Form field data** - Questions and answers collected during workflow tasks
- **Member data** - User profiles, roles, activity timestamps, and team assignments

### Visualization ideas

Here are popular dashboards Tallyfy customers build:

1. **Process volume trends** - Line charts showing processes launched over time
2. **Completion rate scorecards** - Percentage of on-time completions at a glance
3. **Task duration heatmaps** - Spot bottlenecks by visualizing average task durations
4. **User activity tables** - Leaderboards by completion rate
5. **Form response analysis** - Pivot tables exploring form field data patterns

:::caution[Interpreting time metrics]
Duration metrics show elapsed calendar time between task assignment and completion - including weekends, holidays, and waiting periods. For actual effort tracking, see [how to track time spent on tasks](/products/pro/tutorials/how-to/track-time-in-tasks/#analytics-timestamps-inherit-these-challenges).

## Performance tips

Speed up your Looker Studio reports:

- **Use date range controls** - Don't pull all historical data every time
- **Filter at the source** - Apply filters at the data source level, not in individual charts
- **Limit table rows** - Show top 10 or 20, not thousands of rows
- **Enable caching** - Set data freshness to 12-24 hours (daily updates work fine for most workflow analytics)
- **Pre-aggregate in Athena** - Create Athena views to reduce query complexity

## Sharing and collaboration

Sharing Looker Studio reports is straightforward:

- **View access** - Share report URLs with anyone who needs to see the data
- **Edit access** - Let team members modify reports and create new visualizations
- **Embed reports** - Add reports to websites or internal portals with iframe embeds
- **Schedule emails** - Auto-send report snapshots on a set schedule

## Troubleshooting connection issues

If the connection fails, check these in order:

- **Verify credentials** - Double-check your Access Key and Secret Access Key (one wrong character breaks everything)
- **Check permissions** - Your credentials need `AmazonAthenaFullAccess` and `AmazonS3FullAccess` policies attached
- **Validate S3 path** - Confirm your S3 staging directory path matches exactly what Tallyfy provided
- **Test in AWS Console** - Run a query in the Athena web console to rule out credential issues
- **Check connector status** - Make sure your CData or OWOX subscription is active
- **Review region** - Confirm you're using the correct AWS region from Tallyfy Support

Still stuck? Contact your connector provider's support team first for connection diagnostics, then reach out to Tallyfy Support if the issue is with your Analytics account.

## Cost considerations

| Component | Cost | Notes |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Looker Studio | **Free** | Unlimited reports and dashboards |
| Tallyfy Analytics | Subscription | Contact Tallyfy for pricing |
| CData Connect Cloud | Subscription | Check CData for current pricing |
| OWOX Connector | **Free** | Free Athena connector |
| AWS Query Costs | Pay-per-query | Varies based on data scanned |

:::tip[Reducing AWS query costs]
Athena charges based on data scanned. Keep costs down by using date range filters, caching report data in Looker Studio, and limiting the columns you query. Tallyfy stores analytics data in Parquet format with Snappy compression, which already reduces the volume of data scanned per query.

## Looker Studio vs enterprise Looker

| Feature | Looker Studio | Enterprise Looker |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Cost** | Free + connector fee | Subscription-based |
| **Setup** | 10-15 min | 15-20 min |
| **Data modeling** | Basic | Advanced (LookML) |
| **Embedded analytics** | iframe embeds | Full API |
| **Collaboration** | Share links | Role-based access |
| **Best for** | Small teams, basic dashboards | Large teams, complex analytics |

[^1]: Columnar storage format optimized for analytics - queries run faster and storage costs less than CSV
