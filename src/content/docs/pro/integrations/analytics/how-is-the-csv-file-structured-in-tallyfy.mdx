## CSV Export Structure

Tallyfy's CSV export provides a comprehensive flat-file representation of process data. Each CSV file contains 45 columns that capture the complete state of a process, its tasks, form fields, and comments.

### Accessing CSV Exports

You can export a CSV file for any process by:

1. Opening the process
2. Clicking **Settings** in the top right corner
3. Scrolling to the bottom of the settings panel
4. Clicking **Export CSV**

### Data Organization

The CSV format presents hierarchical process data in a flattened structure. Each row represents a specific element within the process (task, form field, or comment), with columns providing detailed attributes.

For Tallyfy Analytics customers, this same CSV structure forms the basis for the parquet files used in Amazon Athena for business intelligence integration.

### Working with Dates in BI Tools

When using this data in business intelligence tools through Tallyfy Analytics, be aware that date fields may require transformation in your SQL queries. Amazon Athena uses Presto SQL, which has specific date handling functions that differ from other SQL dialects.
