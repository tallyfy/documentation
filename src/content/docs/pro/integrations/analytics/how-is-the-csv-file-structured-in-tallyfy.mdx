## Understanding the CSV Export Structure

You can export any running process data into a CSV file - that's 48 columns of everything happening in your process. Tasks, form answers, comments. All of it lands in a spreadsheet you can analyze however you need.

### How to Export a Process to CSV

1. Open the running process you want to export.
2. Click **Settings** (usually in the top right).
3. Scroll down to the bottom of the settings panel.
4. Click **Export CSV**.

### How the Data is Organized

Here's the thing - your process has multiple layers (process details, tasks, fields within those tasks). The CSV flattens everything into rows. Each row represents one thing: a task, a form field, or a comment.

*Note for Tallyfy Analytics users: The data you query using reporting tools (via Amazon Athena) is based on this same structure, just stored in a more efficient format (Parquet).* 

### Understanding the Columns

The 48 columns break down into logical groups:

#### Process and template info (Columns 1-12)

:::note[Template vs. Blueprint]
Some column names use the term "Blueprint". That's the technical/API name for what you see as a "Template" in the Tallyfy app.
:::

*   **blueprint_id**: Template's unique ID.
*   **blueprint_name**: Template's name.
*   **blueprint_version**: Template's version number.
*   **process_id**: Unique ID for this specific run of the process.
*   **process_name**: Name given to this run of the process.
*   **process_tag**: Any tags added to this process run.
*   **process_owner**: Name of the person who owns this process run.
*   **process_owner_id**: ID of the process owner.
*   **total_tasks_in_process**: How many tasks are in the whole process.
*   **tasks_completed**: How many tasks are finished.
*   **process_status**: Current status (active, problem, or complete).
*   **process_last_modified**: Date/time the process was last updated.

#### Task info (Columns 13-26)

*   **type**: What kind of data this row represents (e.g., `process_task`, `process_task_data` for a form field, `process_task_comment` for a comment).
*   **has_form_fields**: Does the task in this row have form fields? (Yes/No).
*   **kick_off_task_id / name**: ID/Name if this row relates to the initial kick-off form.
*   **process_task_id**: Unique ID for this specific task instance.
*   **process_task_status**: Task status (e.g., shown, hidden, completed - *check exact values*).
*   **process_task_name**: Name of the task.
*   **process_task_alias**: A stable ID for this step from the template (handy for comparing across runs).
*   **process_task_data_id**: ID if this row is for a form field.
*   **process_task_data_name**: Name of the task this form field belongs to.
*   **process_task_comment_id**: ID if this row is for a comment.
*   **milestone_id**: Unique ID of the milestone attached to this task (if any).
*   **milestone_name**: Name of the milestone attached to this task (if any).
*   **milestone_position**: Position/order of the milestone in the process sequence.

#### Assignment and timing info (Columns 27-35)

*   **user_assigned**: Names of assigned members/groups.
*   **assigned_user_id**: IDs of assigned members.
*   **guest_assigned**: Email of assigned guest.
*   **total_users_assigned**: Number of members assigned.
*   **total_guests_assigned**: Number of guests assigned.
*   **total_assignees**: Total people assigned.
*   **completed_by**: ID of person who completed the task.
*   **assigned_or_shown_on**: Date task appeared/was assigned.
*   **due_by**: Task deadline date/time.

#### Form field info (Columns 36-39)
*(These columns only have data if the row `type` is `process_task_data`)*
*   **no_of_form_fields**: How many fields are in the parent task.
*   **form_field_type**: Type of this specific field (text, date, dropdown, etc.).
*   **question_in_form_field**: The question/label for this field.
*   **answer_in_form_field**: The answer entered into this field.

#### Comments and issues info (Columns 40-48)
*(These columns often relate to rows where `type` is `process_task_comment` or provide summary counts on `process_task` rows)*
*   **issue_reported**: Was this comment reporting an issue? (Yes/No).
*   **no_of_issue_reported**: Total issues reported on the task.
*   **issue_resolved**: Was the reported issue resolved? (Yes/No).
*   **no_of_issue_resolved**: Total resolved issues on the task.
*   **total_comments**: Number of regular comments on the task.
*   **comment**: The text of the comment (if `type` is `process_task_comment`).
*   **last_modified**: When this row's data was last updated.
*   **completed_on**: When the task was completed.

### Note on Dates for Reporting Tools

Using Tallyfy Analytics with Power BI or Tableau? You'll need to format date columns in your SQL queries using Amazon Athena / Presto SQL functions.

:::note[Timestamp handling]
All timestamps in CSV exports and audit trails are stored on our server in ISO 8601 format without timezone information. In user-facing areas of Tallyfy, these universal timestamps are automatically converted to display in your personal timezone setting. Works great - consistent storage, accurate local display.
:::

:::tip[Tracking actual work time]
Want to track how long tasks actually take to complete (not just elapsed time)? Check out [how to track time spent on tasks](/products/pro/tutorials/how-to/track-time-in-tasks/). Form fields for hours and minutes will appear in your CSV exports, giving you clean data about actual effort versus calendar time.
