## Tallyfy CSV export structure

Exporting a running process gives you a CSV file with 49 columns[^1] covering tasks, form answers, and comments. Each row represents a single task, form field, kick-off field, or comment - the CSV flattens your process hierarchy into a flat table you can open in any spreadsheet tool.

### How to export a process to CSV

1. Open the running process you want to export.
2. Click **Settings** (top right).
3. Scroll to the bottom of the settings panel.
4. Click **Export CSV**.

### How the data is organized

Your process has layers - template details, tasks, form fields within those tasks, comments on tasks. The CSV flattens all of this into rows. The `type` column tells you what each row represents: `process_task`, `process_task_data` (a form field), `process_task_comment`, or `kick_off_task`.

*If you use Tallyfy Analytics, the data you query through reporting tools (via Amazon Athena) shares this same structure - just stored in Parquet[^2] format for faster querying.*

### Column reference

The 49 columns fall into five groups:

#### Process and template info (columns 1-13)

:::note[Template vs. Blueprint]
Column names use "Blueprint" - that's the API name for what you see as "Template" in the Tallyfy app.
:::

*   **blueprint_id**: Template's unique ID.
*   **blueprint_name**: Template's name.
*   **blueprint_version**: Template's version number.
*   **process_id**: Unique ID for this specific run of the process.
*   **process_name**: Name given to this run.
*   **process_tag**: Tags added to this process run.
*   **process_owner**: Full name of the process owner.
*   **process_owner_id**: ID of the process owner.
*   **total_tasks_in_process**: Total task count in the process (including hidden tasks).
*   **tasks_completed**: Number of finished tasks.
*   **process_status**: Current status (e.g. active, problem, or complete).
*   **process_last_modified**: Date/time the process was last updated. This changes on any modification (edits, archiving, tag changes) - not just completion. For completion timing, use `process_completed_at` instead.
*   **process_completed_at**: Date/time when the process was marked complete. Empty for active or incomplete processes. Use this for calculating process duration and completion metrics.

#### Task info (columns 14-28)

*   **type**: What this row represents - `process_task`, `process_task_data` (form field), `process_task_comment`, or `kick_off_task` (kick-off form field).
*   **has_form_fields**: Always `Yes` in the current export format.
*   **kick_off_task_id**: ID of the kick-off form field (populated only for `kick_off_task` rows).
*   **kick_off_task_name**: Label of the kick-off form field.
*   **process_task_id**: Unique ID for this task instance.
*   **process_task_status**: Either `shown` or `hidden`. Hidden tasks were auto-skipped by automation rules. Task completion is tracked via `completed_on` instead.
*   **process_task_name**: Name of the task.
*   **process_task_alias**: Stable step ID from the template - useful for comparing the same step across different process runs.
*   **process_task_data_id**: ID of the form field (populated only for `process_task_data` rows).
*   **process_task_data_name**: Name of the parent task this form field belongs to.
*   **process_task_comment_id**: ID of the comment (populated only for `process_task_comment` rows).
*   **process_task_comment_name**: Name of the task this comment belongs to.
*   **milestone_id**: ID of the milestone attached to this task (if any).
*   **milestone_name**: Name of the milestone (if any).
*   **milestone_position**: Position of the milestone in the process sequence.

#### Assignment and timing info (columns 29-37)

*   **user_assigned**: Comma-separated names of assigned members. Group assignments appear as `GROUP_{id}_{name}`.
*   **assigned_user_id**: Comma-separated IDs of assigned members.
*   **guest_assigned**: Comma-separated emails of assigned guests.
*   **total_users_assigned**: Number of members assigned.
*   **total_guests_assigned**: Number of guests assigned.
*   **total_assignees**: Total people assigned (members + guests).
*   **completed_by**: ID of the person who completed the task. Shows `0` if not yet completed.
*   **assigned_or_shown_on**: Date/time the task appeared or was assigned. Empty for hidden (auto-skipped) tasks.
*   **due_by**: Task deadline date/time.
*   **completed_on**: Date/time the task was completed.

:::caution[NaN values in date fields]
When using Tallyfy Analytics with Power BI, Tableau, or other tools, you may see the string **"NaN"** in date fields like `completed_on`, `assigned_or_shown_on`, `due_by`, and `process_completed_at`. This happens when the original database value was NULL.

**Why this occurs**:
1. NULL database values are exported to CSV
2. Pandas (Python data processing) converts NULL to NaN (Not a Number)
3. During Parquet conversion, NaN values become the literal string "NaN"
4. Your analytics tool reads "NaN" as text, not a valid date

**How to handle in DAX (Power BI)**:
```dax
FILTER(
    'Query1',
    NOT(ISBLANK('Query1'[completed_on]))
    && 'Query1'[completed_on] <> "nan"
)
```

**How to handle in Tableau**:
```sql
CASE
  WHEN completed_on = 'nan' OR completed_on IS NULL
  THEN NULL
  ELSE completed_on
END
```

Always filter out both ISBLANK/NULL values AND the string "nan" for accurate date calculations.
:::

#### Form field info (columns 38-41)
*(These columns only have data when the row `type` is `process_task_data` or `kick_off_task`)*
*   **no_of_form_fields**: Number of form fields in the parent task (or kick-off form).
*   **form_field_type**: Field type (text, date, dropdown, radio, file, etc.).
*   **question_in_form_field**: The label/question for this field.
*   **answer_in_form_field**: The answer entered into this field. Only populated if the task has been completed.

#### Comments and issues info (columns 42-49)
*(These columns are populated on `process_task_comment` rows)*
*   **issue_reported**: Was this comment reporting an issue? (Yes/No).
*   **no_of_issue_reported**: Total issues reported on the parent task.
*   **issue_resolved**: Was the reported issue resolved? (Yes/No).
*   **no_of_issue_resolved**: Total resolved issues on the parent task.
*   **total_comments**: Number of comments on the parent task.
*   **comment**: The text content of the comment.
*   **last_modified**: When this row's data was last updated.

### Dates and reporting tools

If you're querying Tallyfy Analytics with Power BI or Tableau, you'll format date columns using Amazon Athena / Presto SQL functions.

:::note[Timestamp handling]
All timestamps in CSV exports are stored in ISO 8601 format[^3] without timezone information. In Tallyfy's UI, these timestamps are automatically converted to your personal timezone setting.
:::

:::tip[Tracking actual work time]
Want to measure how long tasks actually take to complete? Check out [how to track time spent on tasks](/products/pro/tutorials/how-to/track-time-in-tasks/). Time-tracking form fields appear in your CSV exports, giving you data about actual effort versus elapsed calendar time.

### Example CSV view

Here's what the exported data looks like in a spreadsheet:

![CSV export spreadsheet with process data](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy/pro/analytics-csv-export-spreadsheet.png)

import { CardGrid, LinkTitleCard } from "~/components";


[^1]: Each column represents a specific data point like process ID, task status, or form field answer
[^2]: Columnar storage format optimized for analytics, typically 10x smaller than CSV with faster query performance
[^3]: Standard datetime format like YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS, ensures consistent parsing across systems
