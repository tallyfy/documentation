## Understanding the CSV Export Structure

Tallyfy lets you export the data from a running process into a CSV file (a common spreadsheet format). This file contains 45 columns of detailed information about the process, its tasks, form answers, and comments.

### How to Export a Process to CSV

1. Open the running process you want to export.
2. Click **Settings** (usually in the top right).
3. Scroll down to the bottom of the settings panel.
4. Click **Export CSV**.

### How the Data is Organized

The CSV file takes all the information from the process (which has different levels like process details, tasks, fields within tasks) and lays it out in a flat list. Each row in the CSV represents either a task, a form field within a task, or a comment on a task.

*Note for Tallyfy Analytics users: The data you query using reporting tools (via Amazon Athena) is based on this same structure, just stored in a more efficient format (Parquet).* 

### Understanding the Columns

The 45 columns are grouped like this:

#### Process & Template Info (Columns 1-12)

:::note[Template vs. Blueprint]
Some column names use the term "Blueprint". This is the technical/API name for what you see as a "Template" in the Tallyfy app.
:::

*   **blueprint_id**: Template's unique ID.
*   **blueprint_name**: Template's name.
*   **blueprint_version**: Template's version number.
*   **process_id**: Unique ID for this specific run of the process.
*   **process_name**: Name given to this run of the process.
*   **process_tag**: Any tags added to this process run.
*   **process_owner**: Name of the person who owns this process run.
*   **process_owner_id**: ID of the process owner.
*   **total_tasks_in_process**: How many tasks are in the whole process.
*   **tasks_completed**: How many tasks are finished.
*   **process_status**: Current status (active, problem, or complete).
*   **process_last_modified**: Date/time the process was last updated.

#### Task Info (Columns 13-23)

*   **type**: What kind of data this row represents (e.g., `process_task`, `process_task_data` for a form field, `process_task_comment` for a comment).
*   **has_form_fields**: Does the task in this row have form fields? (Yes/No).
*   **kick_off_task_id / name**: ID/Name if this row relates to the initial kick-off form.
*   **process_task_id**: Unique ID for this specific task instance.
*   **process_task_status**: Task status (e.g., shown, hidden, completed - *check exact values*).
*   **process_task_name**: Name of the task.
*   **process_task_alias**: A stable ID for this step from the template (useful for comparing across runs).
*   **process_task_data_id**: ID if this row is for a form field.
*   **process_task_data_name**: Name of the task this form field belongs to.
*   **process_task_comment_id**: ID if this row is for a comment.

#### Assignment & Timing Info (Columns 24-32)

*   **user_assigned**: Names of assigned members/groups.
*   **assigned_user_id**: IDs of assigned members.
*   **guest_assigned**: Email of assigned guest.
*   **total_users_assigned**: Number of members assigned.
*   **total_guests_assigned**: Number of guests assigned.
*   **total_assignees**: Total people assigned.
*   **completed_by**: ID of person who completed the task.
*   **assigned_or_shown_on**: Date task appeared/was assigned.
*   **due_by**: Task deadline date/time.

#### Form Field Info (Columns 33-36)
*(These columns only have data if the row `type` is `process_task_data`)*
*   **no_of_form_fields**: How many fields are in the parent task.
*   **form_field_type**: Type of this specific field (text, date, dropdown, etc.).
*   **question_in_form_field**: The question/label for this field.
*   **answer_in_form_field**: The answer entered into this field.

#### Comments & Issues Info (Columns 37-45)
*(These columns often relate to rows where `type` is `process_task_comment` or provide summary counts on `process_task` rows)*
*   **issue_reported**: Was this comment reporting an issue? (Yes/No).
*   **no_of_issue_reported**: Total issues reported on the task.
*   **issue_resolved**: Was the reported issue resolved? (Yes/No).
*   **no_of_issue_resolved**: Total resolved issues on the task.
*   **total_comments**: Number of regular comments on the task.
*   **comment**: The text of the comment (if `type` is `process_task_comment`).
*   **last_modified**: When this row's data was last updated.
*   **completed_on**: When the task was completed.

### Note on Dates for Reporting Tools

If you use Tallyfy Analytics to query this data in tools like Power BI or Tableau, the date columns might need special formatting in your SQL queries (using Amazon Athena / Presto SQL functions).
