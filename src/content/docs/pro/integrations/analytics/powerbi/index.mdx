## Power BI Integration Overview

Power BI transforms your Tallyfy data into stunning visualizations and actionable insights. Want to see exactly how your workflows perform? This integration makes it happen - connecting Microsoft's business intelligence powerhouse directly to your process data through customized dashboards and reports.

### Key Capabilities

- **Interactive Dashboards** - Create dynamic visualizations that respond to member or guest interactions
- **Process Performance Analysis** - Measure and optimize workflow efficiency with detailed metrics
- **Custom Report Development** - Design tailored reports for different stakeholders and needs
- **Real-time Data Access** - Connect directly to your live process data through Amazon Athena[^1]
- **Cross-data Analysis** - Combine Tallyfy data with information from other business systems

### How the Integration Works

Here's the magic: Tallyfy Analytics stores your process data in Amazon Athena - think of it as a super-fast query engine that never sleeps. Power BI then connects through ODBC drivers[^2] (yes, those trusty connectors), letting you build visualizations based on:

1. Process completion times and volumes
2. Task assignments and performance metrics
3. Form field data collected during processes
4. Member and guest engagement and participation statistics

### Common Use Cases

| Business Need | Power BI Solution |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Process Optimization | Duration analysis dashboards highlighting bottlenecks |
| Team Performance | Member or guest activity reports showing completion metrics |
| Data Collection | Visualization of form field data across processes |
| Executive Reporting | High-level KPI dashboards with drill-down capabilities |
| Compliance Tracking | Audit trails and documentation of process compliance |

:::tip[Understanding time metrics]
Task duration metrics in Power BI show elapsed time between assignment and completion - not actual working time. These timestamps include holidays, multi-tasking periods, and external delays. For accurate effort tracking, see [how to track time spent on tasks](/products/pro/tutorials/how-to/track-time-in-tasks/#analytics-timestamps-inherit-these-challenges).

### Authentication Requirements

You'll get two sets of credentials when Tallyfy Analytics is provisioned. Keep them straight:

- **AWS IAM Login** (username/password) - This one's just for the AWS web console
- **Access Key and Secret Access Key** - These are your golden tickets for Power BI connections

:::note[Important]
Power BI needs the Access Key and Secret Access Key - not the IAM credentials. Why? Token-based authentication simply works better with analytics tools. Trust us on this one.

### Getting Started

Ready to dive in? Here's your roadmap:

1. Make sure you've got an active Tallyfy Analytics subscription
2. Download and install Power BI Desktop (it's free)
3. Grab your Access Key and Secret Access Key from Tallyfy
4. Follow the connection guide to link everything up
5. Start creating those eye-catching visualizations

Takes about 15 minutes to set up. The detailed connection guide below walks you through each step.
