## Power BI Integration Overview

Power BI transforms your Tallyfy data into stunning visualizations and actionable insights. Want to see exactly how your workflows perform? This integration makes it happen - connecting Microsoft's business intelligence powerhouse directly to your process data through customized dashboards and reports.

### Key Capabilities

- **Interactive Dashboards** - Create dynamic visualizations that respond to member or guest interactions
- **Process Performance Analysis** - Measure and optimize workflow efficiency with detailed metrics
- **Custom Report Development** - Design tailored reports for different stakeholders and needs
- **Real-time Data Access** - Connect directly to your live process data through Amazon Athena
- **Cross-data Analysis** - Combine Tallyfy data with information from other business systems

### How the Integration Works

Here's the magic: Tallyfy Analytics stores your process data in Amazon Athena - think of it as a super-fast query engine that never sleeps. Power BI then connects through ODBC drivers (yes, those trusty connectors), letting you build visualizations based on:

1. Process completion times and volumes
2. Task assignments and performance metrics
3. Form field data collected during processes
4. Member and guest engagement and participation statistics

### Common Use Cases

| Business Need | Power BI Solution |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Process Optimization | Duration analysis dashboards highlighting bottlenecks |
| Team Performance | Member or guest activity reports showing completion metrics |
| Data Collection | Visualization of form field data across processes |
| Executive Reporting | High-level KPI dashboards with drill-down capabilities |
| Compliance Tracking | Audit trails and documentation of process compliance |

:::tip[Understanding time metrics]
Task duration metrics in Power BI show elapsed time between assignment and completion - not actual working time. These timestamps include holidays, multi-tasking periods, and external delays. For accurate effort tracking, see [how to track time spent on tasks](/products/pro/tutorials/how-to/track-time-in-tasks/#analytics-timestamps-inherit-these-challenges).

### Authentication Requirements

You'll get two sets of credentials when Tallyfy Analytics is provisioned. Keep them straight:

- **AWS IAM Login** (username/password) - This one's just for the AWS web console
- **Access Key and Secret Access Key** - These are your golden tickets for Power BI connections

:::note[Important]
Power BI needs the Access Key and Secret Access Key - not the IAM credentials. Why? Token-based authentication simply works better with analytics tools. Trust us on this one.
