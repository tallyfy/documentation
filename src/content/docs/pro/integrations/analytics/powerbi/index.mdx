## Power BI Integration Overview

Microsoft Power BI provides advanced data visualization and business intelligence capabilities that integrate seamlessly with Tallyfy Analytics. This integration enables you to transform your process data into actionable insights through customized dashboards and reports.

### Key Capabilities

- **Interactive Dashboards** - Create dynamic visualizations that respond to user interactions
- **Process Performance Analysis** - Measure and optimize workflow efficiency with detailed metrics
- **Custom Report Development** - Design tailored reports for different stakeholders and needs
- **Real-time Data Access** - Connect directly to your live process data through Amazon Athena
- **Cross-data Analysis** - Combine Tallyfy data with information from other business systems

### How the Integration Works

Tallyfy Analytics stores your process data in Amazon Athena, a serverless query service that makes your workflow information available for analysis. Power BI connects to this data source using ODBC drivers, allowing you to build visualizations based on:

1. Process completion times and volumes
2. Task assignments and performance metrics
3. Form field data collected during processes
4. User engagement and participation statistics

### Common Use Cases

| Business Need | Power BI Solution |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Process Optimization | Duration analysis dashboards highlighting bottlenecks |
| Team Performance | User activity reports showing completion metrics |
| Data Collection | Visualization of form field data across processes |
| Executive Reporting | High-level KPI dashboards with drill-down capabilities |
| Compliance Tracking | Audit trails and documentation of process compliance |

### Authentication Requirements

When provisioning Tallyfy Analytics, you will receive two distinct credential sets:

- **AWS IAM Login** (username/password) - Used exclusively for accessing the AWS web console
- **Access Key and Secret Access Key** - Required specifically for connecting Power BI to Amazon Athena

:::note[Important]
Always use the Access Key and Secret Access Key for Power BI connections, not the IAM credentials. Token-based authentication provides more reliable connectivity with analytics tools.
