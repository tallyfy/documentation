## Integrate PowerBI with Tallyfy

Microsoft PowerBI is powerful data visualization software. Tallyfy Analytics feeds content from your process data in real-time to Amazon Athena.
By connecting PowerBI to your Athena instance (provided by Tallyfy) you can build any visualization you choose.

## Important note

When you provision Tallyfy Analytics you will receive two sets of credentials.

* The _AWS IAM login_ is only used to access the AWS console on the web
* The _Access Key_ and _Secret Access Key_ is what you need to connect to the Athena database with BI tools
