## Connecting Power BI to Tallyfy data

Power BI connects to your Tallyfy workflow data through Amazon Athena[^1], letting you build dashboards and reports around process performance. You can visualize completion times, task metrics, form field data and team activity - all from live data.

### What you can do

- **Interactive dashboards** - Build visualizations that respond to filters and member or guest interactions
- **Process analysis** - Measure workflow efficiency with duration and completion metrics
- **Custom reports** - Design reports for different stakeholders
- **Live data access** - Query your process data directly through Amazon Athena
- **Cross-system analysis** - Combine Tallyfy data with other business systems in Power BI

### How it works

Tallyfy Analytics stores your process data in Amazon Athena - a serverless query engine for your workflow data. Power BI connects through ODBC drivers[^2], giving you access to:

1. Process completion times and volumes
2. Task assignments and performance metrics
3. Form field data collected during processes
4. Member and guest participation statistics

### Common use cases

| Business need | Power BI solution |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Process optimization | Duration analysis dashboards highlighting bottlenecks |
| Team performance | Member or guest activity reports with completion metrics |
| Data collection | Visualization of form field data across processes |
| Executive reporting | KPI dashboards with drill-down capabilities |
| Compliance tracking | Audit trails and process compliance documentation |

:::tip[Understanding time metrics]
Task duration metrics in Power BI show elapsed time between assignment and completion - not actual working time. These timestamps include holidays, multi-tasking periods and external delays. For accurate effort tracking, see [how to track time spent on tasks](/products/pro/tutorials/how-to/track-time-in-tasks/#analytics-timestamps-inherit-these-challenges).

### Authentication

You get two sets of credentials when Tallyfy Analytics is provisioned:

- **AWS IAM Login** (username/password) - Only for the AWS web console
- **Access Key and Secret Access Key** - Used for Power BI connections

:::note[Important]
Power BI needs the Access Key and Secret Access Key - not the IAM login credentials. Token-based authentication works better with analytics tools.

### Getting started

1. Confirm you have an active [Tallyfy Analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/) subscription
2. Download and install Power BI Desktop (it's free)
3. Get your Access Key and Secret Access Key from Tallyfy

Setup takes about 15 minutes.
