## Power BI Integration with Tallyfy Analytics

Connect Power BI to Tallyfy Analytics and you'll unlock powerful workflow visualization capabilities. Here's how to set up the connection through Amazon Athena - it takes about 15 minutes from start to finish.

### Integration Benefits

- **Advanced Visualization** - Build interactive dashboards showing process bottlenecks and team performance
- **Data-Driven Decisions** - Track workflow metrics that actually matter to your business
- **Custom Analysis** - Create metrics tailored to your organization's specific KPIs
- **Automated Reporting** - Schedule weekly reports that land in stakeholders' inboxes automatically
- **Centralized Data** - Merge Tallyfy data with your CRM, ERP, or other business systems

## Authentication Methods

Amazon Athena hosts your Tallyfy data. You have two ways to authenticate:

| Authentication Method | Description | Recommendation |
|----------------------|-------------|----------------|
| IAM Username/Password | Web console credentials | Not recommended for Power BI |
| Access Key/Secret | Token-based authentication | Recommended for Power BI |

:::caution[Authentication Best Practice]
Token-based authentication is the way to go for Power BI. Why? Using IAM credentials typically triggers this frustrating error: "The security token included in the request is invalid"
:::

When Tallyfy activates your Analytics subscription, you get two credential sets. Keep them straight:

- **AWS IAM Login** (username/password) - Only for the AWS web console
- **Access Key and Secret Access Key** - These are your Power BI connection keys

## Connection Setup Process

### Requirements

- Power BI Desktop installed on your computer
- Tallyfy Analytics subscription activated
- Amazon Athena ODBC driver installed
- Authentication credentials provided by Tallyfy

### Step 1: Install the Amazon Athena ODBC Driver

<Steps>
1. Download the appropriate Amazon Athena ODBC driver from the [AWS documentation page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/connect-with-odbc.html/)
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions
3. Complete the installation before proceeding to the next step
</Steps>

### Step 2: Configure the ODBC Connection

<Steps>
1. On Windows, open the ODBC Data Source Administrator (64-bit)
2. Navigate to the **System DSN** tab
3. Click **Add** to create a new data source
4. Select the **Amazon Athena ODBC Driver** and click **Finish**
5. Configure the connection using the settings detailed below
6. Click **Test** to verify the connection works
7. Click **OK** to save the connection
</Steps>

Here's exactly what to enter for each setting:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Data Source Name | Tallyfy Analytics |
| Description | Tallyfy workflow data |
| AWS Region | us-west-2 |
| S3 Output Location | As provided by Tallyfy |
| Authentication Option | IAM Profile |
| Access Key | Your Tallyfy-provided Access Key |
| Secret Key | Your Tallyfy-provided Secret Access Key |
| Workgroup | Your organization ID (as provided by Tallyfy) |
| Catalog | AwsDataCatalog |

### Step 3: Connect Power BI to Amazon Athena

<Steps>
1. Launch Power BI Desktop
2. Click **Get Data** in the ribbon menu
3. Select **More...** to view all connectors
4. Choose **ODBC** from the Database section and click **Connect**
5. From the DSN dropdown, select the **Tallyfy Analytics** connection you created
6. Click **OK** to establish the connection
7. In the Navigator window, expand **AwsDataCatalog**
8. Select your database (typically your organization name)
9. Choose the tables you want to analyze
10. Click **Load** to import the data into Power BI
</Steps>

## Working with Tallyfy Data

You're connected! Now you can explore these data tables:

- **processes** - Track every process instance with its metadata and status
- **steps** - Analyze task completion times and identify bottlenecks
- **form_fields** - Extract all the data your teams collect through process forms
- **users** - Monitor team member workload and performance metrics

### Important Configuration Notes

Here's what catches most people off guard:

- You must connect to the **us-west-2** region - other regions won't work
- Your workgroup needs to match your organization ID exactly
- The catalog name is always **AwsDataCatalog** (yes, with that exact capitalization)
- Use Direct Query mode when working with datasets over 1GB
- Set up refresh scheduling if you need reports updated automatically

## Troubleshooting

Connection not working? Let's fix that:

- Double-check you're using the Access Key and Secret Access Key - not those IAM credentials
- Make sure your ODBC driver is the 64-bit version (32-bit won't work with Power BI Desktop)
- Verify you've entered **us-west-2** as the region - it's easy to miss
- Check if your Tallyfy Analytics subscription is still active
- Sometimes Power BI Desktop needs a restart after configuring ODBC - annoying but it works

Still stuck? Contact Tallyfy Support with the exact error message you're seeing.
