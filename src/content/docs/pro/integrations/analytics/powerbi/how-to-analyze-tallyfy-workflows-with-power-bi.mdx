## Power BI Integration with Tallyfy Analytics

Tallyfy Analytics integrates with Microsoft Power BI to enable analysis and visualization of your workflow data. This guide explains how to establish a secure connection between Power BI and Tallyfy Analytics using Amazon Athena as the data source.

### Integration Benefits

- **Advanced Visualization** - Create interactive dashboards and reports based on process data
- **Data-Driven Decisions** - Analyze workflow performance with business intelligence tools
- **Custom Analysis** - Develop tailored metrics specific to your organization's needs
- **Automated Reporting** - Schedule and distribute workflow insights to stakeholders
- **Centralized Data** - Combine Tallyfy data with information from other business systems

## Authentication Methods

Amazon Athena (which hosts Tallyfy Analytics data) offers two authentication approaches:

| Authentication Method | Description | Recommendation |
|----------------------|-------------|----------------|
| IAM Username/Password | Web console credentials | Not recommended for Power BI |
| Access Key/Secret | Token-based authentication | Recommended for Power BI |

:::caution[Authentication Best Practice]
For Power BI connections, token-based authentication is strongly recommended. Using IAM credentials often results in the error: "The security token included in the request is invalid"
:::

When Tallyfy provisions your Analytics subscription, you'll receive two distinct credential sets:

- **AWS IAM Login** (username/password) - Use only for accessing the AWS web console
- **Access Key and Secret Access Key** - Use specifically for connecting Power BI and other BI tools

## Connection Setup Process

### Requirements

- Power BI Desktop installed on your computer
- Tallyfy Analytics subscription activated
- Amazon Athena ODBC driver installed
- Authentication credentials provided by Tallyfy

### Step 1: Install the Amazon Athena ODBC Driver

<Steps>
1. Download the appropriate Amazon Athena ODBC driver from the [AWS documentation page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/connect-with-odbc.html/)
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions
3. Complete the installation before proceeding to the next step
</Steps>

### Step 2: Configure the ODBC Connection

<Steps>
1. On Windows, open the ODBC Data Source Administrator (64-bit)
2. Navigate to the **System DSN** tab
3. Click **Add** to create a new data source
4. Select the **Amazon Athena ODBC Driver** and click **Finish**
5. Configure the connection using the settings detailed below.
6. Click **Test** to verify the connection works
7. Click **OK** to save the connection
</Steps>

Use the following settings for the connection:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Data Source Name | Tallyfy Analytics |
| Description | Tallyfy workflow data |
| AWS Region | us-west-2 |
| S3 Output Location | As provided by Tallyfy |
| Authentication Option | IAM Profile |
| Access Key | Your Tallyfy-provided Access Key |
| Secret Key | Your Tallyfy-provided Secret Access Key |
| Workgroup | Your organization ID (as provided by Tallyfy) |
| Catalog | AwsDataCatalog |

### Step 3: Connect Power BI to Amazon Athena

<Steps>
1. Launch Power BI Desktop
2. Click **Get Data** in the ribbon menu
3. Select **More...** to view all connectors
4. Choose **ODBC** from the Database section and click **Connect**
5. From the DSN dropdown, select the **Tallyfy Analytics** connection you created
6. Click **OK** to establish the connection
7. In the Navigator window, expand the **AwsDataCatalog**.
8. Select your database (typically your organization name).
9. Choose the tables you want to analyze.
10. Click **Load** to import the data into Power BI.
</Steps>

## Working with Tallyfy Data

After connecting, you can work with several key data tables:

- **processes** - Overall process instances with metadata
- **steps** - Individual task completions and durations
- **form_fields** - Data collected through forms in your processes
- **users** - Team member participation and performance

### Important Configuration Notes

- Always connect to the **us-west-2** region specifically
- Ensure your workgroup matches your organization ID
- The catalog name must be **AwsDataCatalog**
- Use Direct Query mode for larger datasets
- Consider using data refresh scheduling for regular updates

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter connection issues:

- Verify you're using the correct Access Key and Secret Access Key (not IAM credentials)
- Confirm your ODBC driver is the 64-bit version compatible with your Power BI installation
- Check that you've specified the correct AWS region (us-west-2)
- Ensure your Tallyfy Analytics subscription is active
- Try restarting Power BI Desktop after configuring the ODBC connection
