## Connecting Power BI to Tallyfy Analytics

Connect Power BI to Tallyfy Analytics through Amazon Athena[^1] and build dashboards from your workflow data. The setup takes about 15 minutes.

With this connection, you can build interactive dashboards showing bottlenecks and team performance, create metrics tailored to your KPIs, schedule automated reports, and merge Tallyfy data with other business systems like your CRM or ERP.

## Connection architecture

Power BI connects to your Tallyfy data through Amazon Athena via an ODBC driver.

```d2
direction: right

Start: Power BI Desktop {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#f2faf4"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

ODBC: ODBC Driver {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#f2faf4"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

Athena: Amazon Athena {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#f2faf4"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

Data: Tallyfy Data (S3 Parquet) {
  shape: cylinder
  style.fill: "#e1f7e6"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.stroke-width: 2
}

Start -> ODBC {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

ODBC -> Athena {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.animated: true
}

Athena -> Data {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.animated: true
}
```

**What to notice:**
- Use Access Key/Secret authentication - IAM credentials cause errors
- All connections must use the **us-west-2** region

## Authentication methods

When Tallyfy activates your Analytics subscription, you receive two credential sets:

| Authentication Method | Description | Use for |
|----------------------|-------------|---------|
| IAM Username/Password | Web console credentials | AWS web console only |
| Access Key/Secret | Token-based authentication | Power BI (recommended) |

:::caution[Use Access Key authentication]
IAM credentials trigger the error "The security token included in the request is invalid" when used with Power BI. Always use your Access Key and Secret Access Key instead.
:::

## Connection setup

### Requirements

- Power BI Desktop installed
- Tallyfy Analytics subscription activated
- Amazon Athena ODBC driver installed
- Access Key credentials provided by Tallyfy

### Step 1: Install the Amazon Athena ODBC driver

<Steps>
1. Download the Amazon Athena ODBC driver from the [AWS documentation page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/connect-with-odbc.html/)
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions
3. Complete the installation before proceeding
</Steps>

### Step 2: Configure the ODBC connection

<Steps>
1. On Windows, open the ODBC Data Source Administrator (64-bit)
2. Go to the **System DSN** tab
3. Click **Add** to create a new data source
4. Select the **Amazon Athena ODBC Driver** and click **Finish**
5. Configure the connection using the settings below
6. Click **Test** to verify, then **OK** to save
</Steps>

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Data Source Name | Tallyfy Analytics |
| Description | Tallyfy workflow data |
| AWS Region | us-west-2 |
| S3 Output Location | As provided by Tallyfy |
| Authentication Option | IAM Profile |
| Access Key | Your Tallyfy-provided Access Key |
| Secret Key | Your Tallyfy-provided Secret Access Key |

### Step 3: Connect Power BI to Athena

<Steps>
1. Launch Power BI Desktop
2. Click **Get Data** in the ribbon menu
3. Select **More...** to view all connectors
4. Choose **ODBC** from the Database section and click **Connect**

9. Choose the tables you want to analyze
10. Click **Load** to import the data into Power BI
</Steps>

## Working with Tallyfy data

You're connected. Your Tallyfy Analytics data is organized as:

- **Per-process Parquet files** - Each process run is exported as a single flat table. Rows are differentiated by the `type` column: `kick_off_task` (kick-off form data), `process_task` (task-level data), `process_task_data` (form field answers within tasks), and `process_task_comment` (comments). Columns include process metadata (`blueprint_name`, `process_status`, `process_owner`), task details (`process_task_name`, `completed_on`, `due_by`, `user_assigned`), and form field data (`form_field_type`, `question_in_form_field`, `answer_in_form_field`).
- **Members table** - User data including `email`, `full_name`, `job_title`, `is_active`, `timezone`, and login activity timestamps.

:::caution[Time metrics show elapsed time]
Completion times show elapsed calendar time, not actual working time. A "3-day" task might be 30 minutes of work interrupted by a weekend. For accurate effort metrics, implement time tracking fields as described in [how to track time spent on tasks](/products/pro/tutorials/how-to/track-time-in-tasks/#analytics-timestamps-inherit-these-challenges).
:::

:::tip[Calculating accurate process completion times with NaN handling]
The `process_last_modified` field updates whenever a process is edited, archived, or modified - not just when it's completed. For accurate completion time calculations, use the maximum `completed_on` timestamp from all tasks in the process instead.

**Important**: Date fields may contain the string "NaN" when the original database value was NULL. Always filter these out to prevent errors.

**DAX Formula (Calculated Column) - Process Completion Timestamp:**
```dax
Process_Actual_Completion =
CALCULATE(
    MAXX(
        FILTER(
            'Query1',
            'Query1'[process_id] = EARLIER('Query1'[process_id])
            && 'Query1'[type] = "process_task"
            && NOT(ISBLANK('Query1'[completed_on]))
            && 'Query1'[completed_on] <> "nan"
        ),
        DATEVALUE('Query1'[completed_on]) + TIMEVALUE('Query1'[completed_on])
    )
)
```

**DAX Formula (Measure) - Average Process Completion Time:**
```dax
Average_Process_Completion_Time =
VAR ProcessCompletions =
ADDCOLUMNS (
    SUMMARIZE (
        FILTER (
            'Query1',
            'Query1'[process_status] = "complete"
            && 'Query1'[type] = "process_task"
        ),
        'Query1'[process_id]
    ),
    "First_Assigned_Date",
    CALCULATE (
        MINX (
            FILTER (
                'Query1',
                NOT(ISBLANK('Query1'[assigned_or_shown_on]))
                && 'Query1'[assigned_or_shown_on] <> "nan"
            ),
            DATEVALUE('Query1'[assigned_or_shown_on]) + TIMEVALUE('Query1'[assigned_or_shown_on])
        )
    ),
    "Last_Task_Completed_Date",
    CALCULATE (
        MAXX (
            FILTER (
                'Query1',
                NOT(ISBLANK('Query1'[completed_on]))
                && 'Query1'[completed_on] <> "nan"
            ),
            DATEVALUE('Query1'[completed_on]) + TIMEVALUE('Query1'[completed_on])
        )
    )
)
RETURN
AVERAGEX (
    FILTER (
        ProcessCompletions,
        NOT(ISBLANK([First_Assigned_Date]))
        && NOT(ISBLANK([Last_Task_Completed_Date]))
    ),
    DATEDIFF([First_Assigned_Date], [Last_Task_Completed_Date], DAY)
)
```

**Key Points:**
- **Timestamp Precision**: Using `DATEVALUE() + TIMEVALUE()` preserves exact completion times down to the second. Using `DATEVALUE()` alone would only give day-level precision, losing hours, minutes, and seconds - resulting in fractional days for sub-day durations (e.g., 2.3 days instead of just 2 days)
- Groups by `process_id` ONLY (not by `assigned_or_shown_on`) to avoid duplicate rows
- Filters out both ISBLANK and "nan" string values
- Calculates when the last task was completed, representing the true process completion timestamp
- Works correctly even if processes are archived/unarchived later

**Why NaN Appears**: NULL database values → Pandas conversion → Parquet export → string "NaN"

### Configuration notes

- You must connect to the **us-west-2** region - other regions won't work
- Your workgroup must match your organization ID exactly
- The catalog name is always **AwsDataCatalog** (exact capitalization matters)
- Use Direct Query mode[^2] for datasets over 1GB
- Set up refresh scheduling if you need reports updated automatically

## Troubleshooting

- Verify you're using the **Access Key and Secret Access Key** - not IAM credentials
- The ODBC driver must be the **64-bit** version (32-bit won't work with Power BI Desktop)
- Confirm the region is **us-west-2**
- Check that your Tallyfy Analytics subscription is active
- Restart Power BI Desktop after configuring a new ODBC data source
