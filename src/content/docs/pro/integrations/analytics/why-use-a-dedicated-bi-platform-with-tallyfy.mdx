title: Why use BI platforms vs. native analytics?
---

## Business Intelligence Integration Strategy

Tallyfy has deliberately chosen to integrate with existing Business Intelligence (BI) platforms rather than building a limited native analytics solution. This approach provides advantages for organizations seeking to analyze their workflow data insights.

### Leveraging Specialized Analytics Tools

Instead of developing a limited in-house analytics solution, Tallyfy connects directly with industry-leading BI platforms:

- **Purpose-built functionality** - Dedicated BI tools deliver effective visualization capabilities
- **Advanced analytics features** - Access to statistical analysis, predictive modeling, and AI insights
- **Continual innovation** - Benefit from ongoing development by BI platform specialists
- **Familiar interfaces** - Utilize tools your teams already know and understand

### Cross-Platform Data Integration

A key advantage of external BI integration is the ability to combine Tallyfy data with information from other business systems:

- Merge workflow performance with financial metrics
- Connect process efficiency to customer satisfaction data
- Integrate task completion rates with resource utilization
- Combine multiple data sources for comprehensive operational insights

### Platform Independence and Flexibility

Tallyfy's approach to analytics provides flexibility:

- **Platform choice** - Select the BI solution that best fits your organization's needs
- **No vendor lock-in** - Change analytics tools without losing access to your process data
- **Customization options** - Build dashboards and reports tailored to specific roles and needs
- **Scalability** - Grow your analytics capabilities without changing your workflow platform

### Data Portability for Future Innovation

Your workflow data has value beyond current analytics applications:

- **Data science accessibility** - Provide data scientists direct access to raw process data
- **Machine learning readiness** - Train AI models on your workflow patterns and outcomes
- **Open data formats** - Standard CSV and SQL interfaces ensure future compatibility
- **Data ownership** - Maintain full control of your organizational data assets

### Resource Optimization

Use your existing analytics investments and expertise:

- Utilize your current BI platform licenses
- Employ the skills of your existing data analysts and BI specialists
- Avoid duplicating analytics infrastructure
- Focus on insights rather than learning new tools

This integration-focused approach ensures you get the benefits of both Tallyfy's workflow management and the analytics capabilities of specialized BI platforms.

## Why Tallyfy connects to BI tools instead of building its own reports

Tallyfy made a deliberate choice: instead of building basic reporting features inside Tallyfy, we focus on making it easy to connect your Tallyfy process data to powerful, dedicated Business Intelligence (BI) tools that your company might already use (like Power BI, Tableau, Looker, etc.). Here's why this approach is better for you:

### Use the best tools for the job

Dedicated BI platforms are built specifically for data analysis and offer much more than Tallyfy could build internally:

- **Better charts and graphs**: BI tools are experts at creating effective ways to visualize data.
- **Advanced features**: Get access to deeper analysis, predictions, and AI-powered insights.
- **Constant improvement**: BI companies are always updating their tools with the latest features.
- **Familiar tools**: Your team can use the reporting tools they already know.

### Combine Tallyfy data with other business data

Connecting to external BI tools lets you see the bigger picture by mixing Tallyfy data with data from other systems:

- See how process efficiency affects financial results.
- Link workflow times to customer satisfaction scores.
- Compare task completion rates with employee schedules or costs.
- Combine data from sales, support, and operations for a full view.

### Freedom and flexibility

Connecting Tallyfy to external tools gives you more choice:

- **Choose your favorite BI tool**: Pick the platform that works best for your company.
- **Avoid being locked in**: If you switch BI tools later, you can still connect to your Tallyfy data.
- **Customize reports**: Build the exact dashboards and reports different teams need.
- **Grow easily**: Your reporting abilities can grow without needing changes to Tallyfy itself.

### Your data is ready for the future

Having your raw Tallyfy process data available separately means:

- **Data scientists can use it**: Your data team can easily access the raw data for deep analysis.
- **Ready for AI/Machine Learning**: Use your workflow history to train predictive models.
- **Standard formats**: Data is available via standard methods (SQL) ensuring future tool compatibility.
- **You own your data**: You always maintain full control over your company's process data.

### Use your existing resources

Leverage the tools and skills you already have:

- Use your existing licenses for Power BI, Tableau, etc.
- Use your current data analysts who already know these tools.
- Avoid paying for and setting up separate reporting systems.
- Focus on getting insights, not learning a new, limited reporting tool.

By focusing on integration, Tallyfy lets you manage your workflows effectively while using the best available tools to analyze your performance.
