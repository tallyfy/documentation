title: Why use BI platforms vs. native analytics?
---

## Why Tallyfy connects to BI tools instead of building native reports

Instead of building basic reporting features inside Tallyfy, we focus on making it easy to connect your process data to BI tools your company already uses - like Power BI, Tableau, or Looker. Dedicated BI platforms do data analysis better than any workflow tool could. That's by design.

### Specialized tools do it better

BI platforms exist for one reason - data analysis. They offer far more than we could build internally:

- **Stronger visualizations** - Purpose-built charting, dashboards, and interactive reports
- **Deeper analysis** - Statistical analysis, predictions, and AI-powered insights
- **Constant updates** - BI companies ship new features continuously
- **Familiar interfaces** - Your team already knows these tools

### Combine Tallyfy data with everything else

External BI tools let you mix Tallyfy data with information from other systems. The result? A complete picture:

- Track how process efficiency affects financial results
- Link workflow times to customer satisfaction scores (note: workflow times show elapsed time, not effort - see [tracking actual work time](/products/pro/tutorials/how-to/track-time-in-tasks/#analytics-timestamps-inherit-these-challenges))
- Compare task completion rates with employee schedules or costs
- Combine data from sales, support, and operations in one dashboard

### No lock-in, full flexibility

You're not stuck with one analytics solution. Tallyfy's approach keeps your options open:

- **Pick your BI tool** - Choose whichever platform fits your organization best
- **Switch freely** - Change BI tools later without losing access to your Tallyfy data
- **Custom dashboards** - Build the exact reports different teams and roles need
- **Scale independently** - Grow your analytics capabilities without touching your workflow platform

### Your data stays portable

Your workflow data isn't trapped. It's ready for whatever comes next:

- **Data science access** - Give your data team direct access to raw process data
- **ML-ready** - Train predictive models on your workflow patterns and outcomes
- **Standard formats** - SQL and CSV interfaces ensure compatibility with future tools
- **Full ownership** - You keep complete control of your company's process data

### Use what you already have

You've already invested in analytics tools and talent. Use them:

- Keep using existing Power BI, Tableau, or Looker licenses
- Your data analysts already know these platforms - no retraining
- Skip paying for separate reporting systems
- Spend time on insights, not learning new tools

Tallyfy handles workflow management. Top BI tools handle your analytics. Simple.
