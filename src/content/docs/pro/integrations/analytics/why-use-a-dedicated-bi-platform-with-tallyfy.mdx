title: Why use BI platforms vs. native analytics?
---

## Business Intelligence Integration Strategy

Tallyfy integrates with existing Business Intelligence (BI) platforms rather than building a limited native analytics solution. Why? Because this approach gives organizations real advantages when analyzing their workflow data.

### Leveraging Specialized Analytics Tools

Instead of reinventing the wheel, Tallyfy connects directly with industry-leading BI platforms. Here's what you get:

- **Purpose-built functionality** - Dedicated BI tools deliver powerful visualization capabilities
- **Advanced analytics features** - Access to statistical analysis, predictive modeling, and AI insights  
- **Continual innovation** - Benefit from ongoing development by BI platform specialists
- **Familiar interfaces** - Your teams can use tools they already know

### Cross-Platform Data Integration

Want to see the bigger picture? External BI integration lets you combine Tallyfy data with information from other business systems:

- Merge workflow performance with financial metrics
- Connect process efficiency to customer satisfaction data
- Integrate task completion rates with resource utilization
- Combine multiple data sources for comprehensive operational insights

### Platform Independence and Flexibility

You're not stuck with one solution. Tallyfy's analytics approach keeps you flexible:

- **Platform choice** - Pick the BI solution that fits your organization best
- **No vendor lock-in** - Switch analytics tools without losing access to your process data
- **Customization options** - Build dashboards and reports tailored to specific roles
- **Scalability** - Grow your analytics capabilities without changing your workflow platform

### Data Portability for Future Innovation

Your workflow data isn't trapped - it's ready for whatever comes next:

- **Data science accessibility** - Give data scientists direct access to raw process data
- **Machine learning readiness** - Train AI models on your workflow patterns and outcomes
- **Open data formats** - Standard CSV and SQL interfaces ensure future compatibility
- **Data ownership** - You maintain full control of your organizational data assets

### Resource Optimization

Here's the thing - you've already invested in analytics tools and talent. Use them:

- Leverage your current BI platform licenses
- Put your existing data analysts and BI specialists to work
- Avoid duplicating analytics infrastructure
- Focus on insights, not learning new tools

This integration approach gets you the best of both worlds - Tallyfy's workflow management plus the analytics power of specialized BI platforms.

## Why Tallyfy connects to BI tools instead of building its own reports

We made a choice. Instead of building basic reporting features inside Tallyfy, we focus on making it easy to connect your process data to powerful BI tools your company might already use - like Power BI, Tableau, or Looker. Here's why this approach works better:

### Use the best tools for the job

BI platforms are built for one thing - data analysis. They offer way more than we could ever build internally:

- **Better charts and graphs**: BI tools excel at creating effective data visualizations
- **Advanced features**: Get deeper analysis, predictions, and AI-powered insights
- **Constant improvement**: BI companies update their tools with new features all the time
- **Familiar tools**: Your team can use the reporting tools they already know

### Combine Tallyfy data with other business data

External BI tools let you mix Tallyfy data with information from other systems. The result? You see the complete picture:

- Track how process efficiency affects financial results
- Link workflow times to customer satisfaction scores (but remember: workflow times show elapsed time, not effort - see [tracking actual work time](/products/pro/tutorials/how-to/track-time-in-tasks/#analytics-timestamps-inherit-these-challenges))
- Compare task completion rates with employee schedules or costs
- Combine data from sales, support, and operations

### Freedom and flexibility

You get choices. Lots of them:

- **Choose your favorite BI tool**: Pick the platform that works best for your company
- **Avoid being locked in**: Switch BI tools later? You can still access your Tallyfy data
- **Customize reports**: Build the exact dashboards and reports different teams need
- **Grow easily**: Your reporting capabilities can expand without touching Tallyfy

### Your data is ready for the future

Raw process data, available separately. What does that mean for you?

- **Data scientists can use it**: Your data team gets easy access for deep analysis
- **Ready for AI/Machine Learning**: Train predictive models on your workflow history
- **Standard formats**: SQL access ensures compatibility with future tools
- **You own your data**: You always keep full control over your company's process data

### Use your existing resources

Stop reinventing. Start leveraging:

- Use existing licenses for Power BI, Tableau, and other tools
- Your current data analysts already know these platforms
- Skip paying for (and learning) separate reporting systems  
- Focus on insights, not new tool training

That's the power of integration. Tallyfy handles workflow management while best-in-class BI tools handle your analytics.
