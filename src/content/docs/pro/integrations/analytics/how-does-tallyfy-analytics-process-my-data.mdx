## Tallyfy Analytics Data Processing Architecture

Tallyfy Analytics provides near real-time data processing that enables business intelligence capabilities through a streamlined data pipeline. This article explains the technical architecture and data flow from process events to your analytics dashboard.

### Data Pipeline Overview

The Tallyfy Analytics pipeline consists of five main stages that transform raw process events into analytics-ready data:

1. **Event detection** - API activities trigger data capture
2. **Data extraction** - Complete process objects are exported
3. **Data transformation** - Files are converted to optimized formats
4. **Secure storage** - Data is stored in dedicated cloud infrastructure
5. **Analytics access** - BI tools connect through standard interfaces

### Detailed Process Flow

#### 1. Event Capture

When specific events occur in Tallyfy (task completion, process status changes, form submissions), the system identifies these as analytics-eligible events. The Analytics service receives notification of these events in near real-time.

#### 2. Data Extraction

For each qualifying event, Tallyfy exports a complete snapshot of the affected process, including:
- Process metadata (owner, status, timestamps)
- Task details and relationships
- Form field submissions
- Assignment information
- Comments and issues

This data is initially formatted as a comprehensive CSV file with all relevant fields.

#### 3. Data Transformation

The CSV data is automatically converted to Apache Parquet format, which provides:
- Column-oriented storage for efficient querying
- Compression to reduce storage requirements
- Performance optimization for analytical workloads
- Compatibility with major BI platforms

#### 4. Secure Storage

Transformed data files are stored in:
- **Storage layer**: Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
- **Access control**: Organization-specific private folders
- **Security**: AWS security protocols and access controls
- **Retention**: Data maintained according to subscription terms

#### 5. Analytics Integration

Tallyfy provides AWS IAM credentials that enable:
- Direct connection to Amazon Athena query service
- SQL-based access to your process data
- Integration with standard BI tool connectors
- Customizable queries and data visualization

### Activation and Access

- Analytics data processing begins only after the feature is activated for your organization
- IAM credentials are provided upon activation
- Data is accessible through standard JDBC/ODBC drivers
- Custom integration options are available for specialized needs
