## How Tallyfy Analytics prepares your data

Tallyfy Analytics takes the information from your running processes and gets it ready so you can analyze it using business reporting tools (like Power BI or Tableau). This article gives a simple overview of how that data moves from Tallyfy to your analysis tools.

### Overview of the Data Process

Getting your data ready involves five main steps:

1. **Spotting an event**: Tallyfy notices when something important happens (like a task finishing).
2. **Getting the data**: Tallyfy exports all the details about the process involved.
3. **Changing the format**: The data is converted into a special format optimized for reporting tools.
4. **Storing safely**: The converted data is stored securely in the cloud.
5. **Allowing access**: You get secure keys to connect your reporting tools to this data.

### How the process works in detail

#### 1. Spotting an event

When things happen in Tallyfy (like tasks being completed, statuses changing, or forms being submitted), the system flags these as events that should be recorded for analytics.

#### 2. Getting the data

For each important event, Tallyfy exports a full snapshot of the process it happened in. This includes:
- Basic process info (who owns it, status, start/end times).
- Details about each task.
- Information submitted in form fields.
- Who was assigned to tasks.
- Comments added.

This information is initially saved as a detailed CSV file (a common spreadsheet format).

#### 3. Changing the format

The data (originally in CSV format) is automatically converted into a format called Apache Parquet. This format is:
- Better organized for faster analysis.
- Takes up less storage space.
- Works well with most reporting and analytics tools.

#### 4. Storing safely

The converted Parquet data files are stored securely:
- Using **Amazon S3** (a cloud storage service).
- In a **private folder** just for your organization.
- Protected by standard **AWS security**.
- Kept for as long as your Tallyfy Analytics subscription requires.

#### 5. Allowing access for analysis

Tallyfy gives your organization special security keys (AWS IAM credentials). These keys allow your reporting tools to:
- Connect directly to your stored data using a service called **Amazon Athena**.
- Use standard SQL (a common data language) to ask questions about your process data.
- Connect easily using standard methods (like JDBC/ODBC drivers) that most BI tools support.
- Create custom reports and charts.

### Turning on Analytics

- Data processing only starts *after* Tallyfy Analytics is activated for your account.
- You receive the necessary security keys (IAM credentials) when it's activated.
- You can then connect your BI tools using standard connection methods.
- Contact Tallyfy support if you have special needs for where or how data is stored.
