## How Tallyfy Analytics prepares your data

Tallyfy Analytics transforms your workflow data into a format that business reporting tools can understand. Want to analyze your processes in Power BI or Tableau? Here's exactly how your data travels from Tallyfy to those tools.

### Overview of the Data Process

Your data goes through five steps to become analytics-ready:

1. **Detecting an event**: Tallyfy watches for important changes - task completions, status updates, and more.
2. **Extracting the data**: We capture every detail about the process where the event occurred.
3. **Converting the format**: The data gets converted to Apache Parquet - a format built for fast analysis.
4. **Storing securely**: Everything lands in your private Amazon S3 storage bucket.
5. **Providing access**: You receive AWS credentials to connect your favorite BI tools.

### How the process works in detail

#### 1. Spotting an event

Tasks get completed. Statuses change. Forms get submitted. When these actions happen in Tallyfy, the system flags them as analytics events worth tracking.

#### 2. Getting the data

Every event triggers a complete process snapshot. We capture:
- Basic process info (who owns it, status, start and end times)
- Details about each task
- Information submitted in form fields
- Who was assigned to tasks
- Comments added

All this data initially gets saved as a CSV file - just like a spreadsheet you'd open in Excel.

:::note[Timestamp storage format]
All timestamps in the exported data are stored in ISO 8601 format without timezone information. This universal format ensures consistent data storage for reliable analysis across different timezones. When users view this data in Tallyfy's interface, timestamps are automatically converted to display in their personal timezone setting.

:::tip[Understanding time data]
Task timestamps capture when work was assigned and completed - not how long someone actually worked on it. That "5-day" task might include a weekend, holidays, or just 30 minutes of actual effort spread across a busy week. For clean effort metrics, implement time tracking fields.

#### 3. Changing the format

That CSV file won't cut it for serious analytics. Tallyfy automatically converts it to Apache Parquet format, which:
- Analyzes 10x faster than CSV files
- Takes up 80% less storage space  
- Works seamlessly with Power BI, Tableau, and other BI tools

#### 4. Storing safely

Your Parquet files land in a secure home:
- **Amazon S3** handles the storage (yes, the same service Netflix uses)
- You get a **private folder** - no one else can access it
- **AWS security** protects everything with encryption at rest
- Files stay available throughout your Tallyfy Analytics subscription

#### 5. Allowing access for analysis

Here's where the magic happens. Tallyfy gives you AWS IAM credentials - think of them as special keys to your data warehouse. With these credentials, your BI tools can:
- Connect straight to your data through **Amazon Athena** 
- Run SQL queries to slice and dice your process information
- Use familiar JDBC/ODBC connections (every BI tool supports these)
- Build dashboards that actually answer your questions
