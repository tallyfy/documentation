## How Tallyfy Analytics prepares your data

Tallyfy Analytics transforms your workflow data into a format that BI tools like Power BI and Tableau can query directly. Here's how your data travels from Tallyfy to those tools.

### Overview of the data pipeline

Your data goes through five steps to become analytics-ready:

1. **Detecting an event** - Tallyfy watches for changes like task completions, process status updates, and user changes.
2. **Extracting the data** - A complete snapshot of the process where the event occurred gets captured.
3. **Converting the format** - Data is converted to Apache Parquet[^1] for fast, compressed analysis.
4. **Storing securely** - Everything lands in your private Amazon S3 storage bucket.
5. **Providing access** - You receive AWS credentials to connect your BI tools.

### How the pipeline works in detail

#### 1. Spotting an event

Tasks get completed. Statuses change. Forms get submitted. Processes are created, archived, or restored. When these actions happen in Tallyfy, the system queues them for analytics processing.

#### 2. Getting the data

Each queued event triggers a full process snapshot. The export captures:
- Process metadata (owner, status, template name/version, tags, completion timestamps)
- Every task's status, assignees, and due dates
- Form field questions and answers
- User and guest assignments (including group-based assignments)
- Comments and reported issues

This data is initially saved as a CSV file.

:::note[Timestamp storage format]
Timestamps in the exported data use `Y-m-d H:i:s` format without timezone information - for example, `2024-03-15 14:30:00`. This keeps data storage consistent for analysis across different timezones. In Tallyfy's interface, timestamps are converted to each user's personal timezone setting.

:::tip[Understanding time data]
Task timestamps capture when work was assigned and completed - not how long someone actually worked on it. That "5-day" task might include a weekend, holidays, or just 30 minutes of actual effort spread across a busy week. For clean effort metrics, implement time tracking fields.

#### 3. Changing the format

CSV alone won't cut it for serious analytics. Tallyfy automatically converts it to Apache Parquet format using snappy compression, which:
- Queries much faster than raw CSV files
- Takes up significantly less storage space
- Works natively with Power BI, Tableau, and other BI tools

#### 4. Storing safely

Your Parquet files land in a dedicated S3 bucket:
- Each organization gets a **private folder** - no other accounts can access it
- **AWS encryption at rest** protects stored data
- Both the Parquet files and original CSVs are stored for redundancy
- Files stay available throughout your Tallyfy Analytics subscription

#### 5. Allowing access for analysis

Tallyfy provides you with AWS IAM credentials that let your BI tools connect. With these credentials, you can:
- Query your data through **Amazon Athena[^2]** without managing any database infrastructure
- Run SQL queries against your process data
- Use standard JDBC/ODBC connections (supported by virtually every BI tool)
- Build dashboards and reports on top of the queried data

### Activating analytics

A few things to know before you start:
- Data processing begins the moment Tallyfy Analytics is activated on your account - not before
- You'll receive your AWS IAM credentials right after activation
- Most BI tools can be connected in about 15 minutes using standard JDBC/ODBC drivers
- Need data stored in a specific region or format? Contact Tallyfy support first
