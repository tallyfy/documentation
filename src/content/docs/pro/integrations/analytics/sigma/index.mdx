## Sigma Computing Overview

Sigma Computing is a cloud-native BI platform that feels like using a spreadsheet - but with the power of cloud data warehouses behind it. Here's the catch: it can't connect directly to AWS Athena, which powers Tallyfy Analytics.

### About Sigma Computing

Sigma lets business users explore data without writing a single line of SQL. If you're comfortable with Excel, you'll feel right at home. The platform focuses on:

- **Familiar Interface** - Spreadsheet-like experience for data exploration
- **Cloud-Native Architecture** - Built specifically for cloud data platforms
- **Self-Service Analytics** - Empowers business users to create their own analyses
- **Live Data Connections** - Real-time queries without data extraction
- **Collaborative Features** - Team-based workbook editing and sharing

### Current Connection Limitations

**Important Note**: Sigma Computing does not currently support connections to AWS Athena, which is the query engine that powers Tallyfy Analytics.

Sigma Computing connects directly to these data warehouse platforms:

| Supported Platforms | Connection Type |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Snowflake | Native connector |
| Google BigQuery | Native connector |
| Amazon Redshift | Native connector |
| Databricks | Native connector |
| PostgreSQL | Native connector |
| MySQL | Native connector |
| Microsoft SQL Server | Native connector |
| AlloyDB | Native connector |
| Starburst | Native connector |

### Why Sigma Doesn't Support Athena

Sigma needs persistent connections to data warehouses - think of it like keeping a phone line open. AWS Athena works differently. It's serverless, which means:

- **Serverless Architecture** - Athena doesn't maintain persistent connections
- **Query-on-Demand** - Different connection patterns than traditional warehouses
- **S3-Based Storage** - Data stored in S3 rather than warehouse tables

### Potential Workarounds

Can't connect directly? You've got options:

#### Option 1: Use Redshift Spectrum
Got Amazon Redshift? Use Redshift Spectrum to query your S3 data (that's where Tallyfy Analytics stores everything). Then connect Sigma to Redshift. Problem solved.

#### Option 2: Data Warehouse Migration
Move your analytics data to a warehouse Sigma actually supports:
- **Snowflake** - The go-to for most teams running analytics
- **BigQuery** - Google's serverless option (yes, serverless but still works)
- **Redshift** - Amazon's tried-and-true warehouse

#### Option 3: Alternative BI Tools
Want to stick with Athena? These tools play nice with it:
- Power BI (just install the right drivers)
- Tableau (works great with JDBC)
- AWS QuickSight (built for Athena - no surprises there)

### Future Considerations

Things change fast in the data world. Here's what you can do:

- **Monitor Sigma's Roadmap** - They might add Athena support eventually
- **Submit Feature Requests** - Tell Sigma you need this (the squeaky wheel gets the grease)
- **Evaluate Architectural Changes** - Maybe it's time to rethink your data stack anyway?

### Getting Started with Sigma

If you decide to go with Sigma (and a compatible warehouse), they'll give you:

- Free trials to test things out
- Tons of documentation and training
- Professional help if you need it
- An active community

But let's be honest - if you're using Tallyfy Analytics right now, stick with Power BI or Tableau. They work perfectly with Athena.
