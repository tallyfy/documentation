## Sigma Computing Overview

Sigma Computing is a modern, cloud-native business intelligence platform that combines the familiar interface of spreadsheets with the power of cloud data warehouses. While Sigma offers powerful analytics capabilities, it currently does not support direct connections to AWS Athena, which is the data source for Tallyfy Analytics.

### About Sigma Computing

Sigma Computing provides an intuitive, spreadsheet-like interface that allows business users to explore data without needing SQL knowledge. The platform emphasizes:

- **Familiar Interface** - Spreadsheet-like experience for data exploration
- **Cloud-Native Architecture** - Built specifically for cloud data platforms
- **Self-Service Analytics** - Empowers business users to create their own analyses
- **Live Data Connections** - Real-time queries without data extraction
- **Collaborative Features** - Team-based workbook editing and sharing

### Current Connection Limitations

**Important Note**: Sigma Computing does not currently support connections to AWS Athena, which is the query engine that powers Tallyfy Analytics.

Sigma Computing connects directly to these data warehouse platforms:

| Supported Platforms | Connection Type |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Snowflake | Native connector |
| Google BigQuery | Native connector |
| Amazon Redshift | Native connector |
| Databricks | Native connector |
| PostgreSQL | Native connector |
| MySQL | Native connector |
| Microsoft SQL Server | Native connector |
| AlloyDB | Native connector |
| Starburst | Native connector |

### Why Sigma Doesn't Support Athena

Sigma's architecture is designed to connect to persistent data warehouse services that maintain active connections and provide consistent query interfaces. AWS Athena, being a serverless query service, operates differently from traditional data warehouses:

- **Serverless Architecture** - Athena doesn't maintain persistent connections
- **Query-on-Demand** - Different connection patterns than traditional warehouses
- **S3-Based Storage** - Data stored in S3 rather than warehouse tables

### Potential Workarounds

While direct Athena connection isn't available, you might consider these alternatives:

#### Option 1: Use Redshift Spectrum
If you have Amazon Redshift, you can use Redshift Spectrum to query your S3 data (where Tallyfy Analytics stores data) and then connect Sigma to Redshift.

#### Option 2: Data Warehouse Migration
Consider moving your analytics data to a Sigma-supported warehouse like:
- **Snowflake** - Popular choice for analytics workloads
- **BigQuery** - Google's serverless data warehouse
- **Redshift** - Amazon's data warehouse service

#### Option 3: Alternative BI Tools
For AWS Athena connectivity, consider BI tools that support Athena:
- Power BI (with appropriate drivers)
- Tableau (with JDBC connectivity)
- AWS QuickSight (native Athena support)

### Future Considerations

As data architectures evolve, BI vendors may expand their connector support. You might:

- **Monitor Sigma's Roadmap** - Check for future Athena support announcements
- **Submit Feature Requests** - Contact Sigma to express interest in Athena connectivity
- **Evaluate Architectural Changes** - Consider if moving to a supported warehouse aligns with your strategy

### Getting Started with Sigma

If you decide to use Sigma with a compatible data warehouse, the platform offers:

- Free trial periods to evaluate the platform
- Comprehensive documentation and training resources
- Professional services for implementation
- Strong community support and resources

For current Tallyfy Analytics users, the Power BI and Tableau integrations remain the recommended paths for advanced analytics visualization.
