## Finding Sigma-Like Functionality for Tallyfy Analytics

Sigma Computing can't connect directly to Tallyfy Analytics - but don't worry. Several alternatives offer that same spreadsheet-style data exploration you're after. Let's find the best fit for your team.

### What Makes Sigma Unique

Here's what Sigma does differently (and what we need to replicate):

- **Spreadsheet Interface** - Familiar Excel-like interaction model
- **Self-Service Analytics** - Business users can explore data on their own
