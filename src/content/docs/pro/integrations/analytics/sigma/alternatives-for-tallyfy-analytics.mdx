## Sigma alternatives that work with Tallyfy Analytics

Sigma Computing can't connect directly to Tallyfy Analytics because Sigma requires persistent database connections, while Tallyfy Analytics runs on Amazon Athena's serverless, query-by-query model. Several alternatives give you that same spreadsheet-style data exploration though - here's how they compare.

### What makes Sigma different

Sigma's core appeal is a spreadsheet interface over live cloud data - Excel-like interaction with real-time queries, collaborative editing, and no-code data manipulation. That's the experience we need to replicate with a tool that actually supports Athena.

## Alternative tools

### Option 1: Power BI with Excel integration

Power BI gets you closest to Sigma's spreadsheet experience, and it connects directly to Tallyfy Analytics through Athena ODBC drivers.

- **Excel-like grid views** for data exploration and manipulation
- **Direct Athena connection** - native connectivity to your Tallyfy Analytics data
- **Microsoft ecosystem** - pairs with Excel, Teams, and SharePoint
- **Self-service capabilities** - business users can build their own reports

<Steps>
1. **Install Power BI Desktop** with Athena ODBC drivers
2. **Connect to Athena** using your Tallyfy Analytics AWS credentials
3. **Build spreadsheet-style reports** with grid views and pivot-like features
4. **Enable sharing** so your team can collaborate on workbooks
</Steps>

**Best for:** Organizations already using Microsoft tools or wanting the closest Sigma alternative.

### Option 2: Tableau

Tableau connects to Tallyfy Analytics through Athena and offers data grid views, calculated fields, and drag-and-drop manipulation. It leans more toward visualization than spreadsheets - the learning curve is steeper for business users, but the advanced analytics capabilities are stronger.

- **Live Athena connections** for real-time querying
- **Calculated fields** for formula-based data transformation
- **Enterprise governance** features for larger teams

**Best for:** Organizations that need advanced visualization alongside data exploration.

### Option 3: AWS QuickSight

If you're already in AWS, QuickSight connects to Athena natively - no drivers to install. It offers SPICE in-memory caching for fast performance, AI-powered insights, and serverless scaling that matches Athena's architecture.

- **Native Athena integration** - zero driver configuration
- **SPICE in-memory engine** for fast, spreadsheet-like performance
- **Serverless scaling** that matches Athena's model
- **AI-generated insights** for automatic data discovery

**Best for:** AWS-focused organizations that want the simplest setup path.

## Implementation strategies

### Hybrid approach with Excel

For maximum adoption, use Power BI as a data gateway to Tallyfy Analytics, then push data into Excel for detailed manipulation. Schedule automated refreshes so Excel always has current data. This uses existing Excel skills while keeping the live connection to your analytics pipeline.

### Data warehouse bridge to Sigma

If you really want Sigma itself, bridge the gap with a warehouse Sigma supports.

**Snowflake** reads your Tallyfy Analytics Parquet files directly from S3 - no ETL needed. Sigma has a native Snowflake connector, so this gives you the full Sigma experience. Your existing Athena access stays intact. [See our Snowflake setup guide](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/snowflake/).

**Amazon Redshift** can access your S3 data through Redshift Spectrum, keeping everything in AWS. Sigma supports Redshift connections natively.

Before migrating, compare warehouse costs against your current Athena usage and test query performance with your actual data volumes.

### Custom self-service portal

With development resources, you can build a Sigma-like interface directly over Athena - a web frontend with grid components, a backend service querying Athena, caching with Redis or ElastiCache, and CSV/Excel export. This requires a full-stack team and several months of work, but gives you complete control over the experience.

## Choosing the right alternative

| Criteria | Power BI | Tableau | QuickSight | Custom |
|----------|----------|---------|------------|--------|
| **Spreadsheet feel** | High | Medium | Low | High |
| **Setup complexity** | Low | Medium | Low | High |
| **Advanced analytics** | Medium | High | Medium | Customizable |
| **AWS integration** | Medium | Medium | High | High |

**Quick decision guide:** If you use Microsoft tools, start with Power BI. If you're all-in on AWS, go with QuickSight. If you need Sigma specifically, bridge through Snowflake. If you need advanced visualizations, pick Tableau.
