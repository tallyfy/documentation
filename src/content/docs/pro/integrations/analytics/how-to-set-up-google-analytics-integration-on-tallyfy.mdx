## Tracking Template/Process Usage with Analytics Tools

You can connect Tallyfy to web analytics tools like Google Analytics or Mixpanel. These tools show exactly how people in your organization - or guests[^1] - are using your Tallyfy documentation, templates, and processes.

### Why track usage?

- **See what people use**: Find out which templates or documents are viewed most often
- **Measure engagement**: Track exactly how long people spend on specific pages or steps
- **Find popular processes**: Identify which workflows get used 50+ times a week (or barely at all)
- **Understand usage**: Learn when teams access process information - mornings? Late nights?
- **Check value**: See if using certain processes correlates with better results

## Setting up Google Analytics (GA)

### What you need

- A Google Analytics account where you have admin rights
- A Tallyfy Professional or Enterprise plan
- Administrator permission in Tallyfy

### Step 1: Set up Custom Dimensions[^2] in Google Analytics

*Important: Do this step first inside your Google Analytics account.* Tallyfy can't send data without these dimensions configured.

1. Log into Google Analytics
2. Go to **Admin** (gear icon) > **Data display** > **Custom definitions** > **Custom dimensions**
3. Click **Create custom dimension** and create these five dimensions:

| Dimension Name | Scope | Event Parameter   |
|----------------|-------|-------------------|
| User Name      | User  | user_name         |
| User Email     | User  | user_email        |
| Process Name   | Event | process_name      |
| Event Type     | Event | event_type        |
| Event Details  | Event | event_details     |

:::caution[Match settings EXACTLY!]
The dimension names and event parameters must match the table above. Incorrect configuration will prevent data from flowing to your reports.
:::

### Step 2: Get your Google Analytics Measurement ID

1. In Google Analytics, go to **Admin** > **Data Streams**
2. Select your web data stream and copy your **Measurement ID** (it looks like G-XXXXXXXXXX)

### Step 3: Connect Tallyfy to Google Analytics

<Steps>
1. In Tallyfy, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Find and click the **Analytics** section
3. Paste your Google Analytics Measurement ID (from Step 2) into the box provided
4. Click **Save**
</Steps>

That's it. Tallyfy now sends usage data (page views, events, the works) straight to your Google Analytics account.

## Tracking specific users with User ID in GA (Optional)

Want to track the same user across their laptop, phone, and tablet? Google Analytics supports User ID tracking - it identifies logged-in users across different devices or sessions.

:::note[User ID in GA4]
GA4 handles user identification differently than older versions. When Tallyfy sends user data, GA4 automatically associates events with the user across devices. Go to **Admin** > **Reporting identity** to configure how GA4 identifies users (blended, observed, or device-based).
:::

:::note[Data takes time]
Google Analytics typically takes 24-48 hours to process and display new data. Don't panic if you don't see anything right away.
:::

## Setting up Mixpanel Integration

Mixpanel is another analytics tool you can connect to Tallyfy. It's great for tracking specific events and user actions.

### How to connect Mixpanel

<Steps>
1. In Tallyfy, go to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Analytics**.
2. Enter your **Mixpanel Project Token** (you'll find this in your Mixpanel account).
3. Click **Save**.
</Steps>

### What Mixpanel tracks

Mixpanel captures detailed information about specific actions people take in Tallyfy:
- Viewing a template
- Completing a step
- Launching a process
- Engaging with specific documents

:::caution[Privacy with Mixpanel]
Mixpanel collects detailed event data in your Mixpanel account - including user information. Make sure your company's privacy policy covers this data collection.
:::

### Using the Analytics Data

Once you're connected, here's what you can do with Google Analytics or Mixpanel:
- Build custom reports about Tallyfy usage
- Create real-time dashboards to spot trends
- Set up alerts when usage patterns change
- Export data for deeper analysis
