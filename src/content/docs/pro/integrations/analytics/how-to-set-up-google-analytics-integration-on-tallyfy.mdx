## Tracking Template/Process Usage with Analytics Tools

You can connect Tallyfy to web analytics tools like Google Analytics or Mixpanel. These tools show exactly how people in your organization - or guests[^1] - are using your Tallyfy documentation, templates, and processes.

### Why track usage?

- **See what people use**: Find out which templates or documents are viewed most often
- **Measure engagement**: Track exactly how long people spend on specific pages or steps
- **Find popular processes**: Identify which workflows get used 50+ times a week (or barely at all)
- **Understand usage**: Learn when teams access process information - mornings? Late nights?
- **Check value**: See if using certain processes correlates with better results

## Setting up Google Analytics (GA)

### What you need

- A Google Analytics account where you have admin rights
- A Tallyfy Professional or Enterprise plan
- Administrator permission in Tallyfy

### Step 1: Set up Custom Dimensions[^2] in Google Analytics

*Important: Do this step first inside your Google Analytics account.* Tallyfy can't send data without these dimensions configured.

1. Log into Google Analytics
2. Go to **Admin** (gear icon) > find the **Property** column > **Custom Definitions** > **Custom Dimensions**
3. Create **five** new custom dimensions. Configure them exactly like this:

| Name          | Index | Scope   | Active |
|---------------|-------|---------|--------|
| User Name     | 1     | User    | Yes    |
| User Email    | 2     | User    | Yes    |
| Process Name  | 3     | Session | Yes    |
| Event Type    | 4     | Hit     | Yes    |
| Event Details | 5     | Hit     | Yes    |

:::caution[Match settings EXACTLY!]
The names, index numbers (1-5), and scope must match the table above perfectly. Get any of these wrong? No data will flow from Tallyfy.
:::

### Step 2: Get your Google Analytics Tracking ID

1. In Google Analytics, go to **Admin** > **Property Settings**
2. Find and copy your **Tracking ID** (it looks like UA-XXXXX-Y)

### Step 3: Connect Tallyfy to Google Analytics

<Steps>
1. In Tallyfy, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Find and click the **Analytics** section
3. Paste your Google Analytics Tracking ID (from Step 2) into the box provided
4. Click **Save**
</Steps>

That's it. Tallyfy now sends usage data (page views, events, the works) straight to your Google Analytics account.

## Tracking specific users with User ID in GA (Optional)

Want to track the same user across their laptop, phone, and tablet? Google Analytics has this feature called "User ID" - it tracks individual logged-in users across different devices or sessions.

### Step 1: Turn On User ID in Google Analytics

1. In Google Analytics, go to **Admin**.
2. Under **Property**, find **Tracking Info** > **User ID**.

3. Read the policy and turn the feature **ON**.

### Step 2: Create a User ID View in Google Analytics

1. Follow the steps on the User ID page in GA to create a new **View**.
2. This view will specifically show data tracked using the User ID.

:::note[Data takes time]
Google says it takes 24-48 hours for data to show up in a new User ID view. Don't panic if you don't see anything right away.

## Setting up Mixpanel Integration

Mixpanel is another analytics tool you can connect to Tallyfy. It's great for tracking specific events and user actions.

### How to connect Mixpanel

<Steps>
1. In Tallyfy, go to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Analytics**.
2. Enter your **Mixpanel Project Token** (you'll find this in your Mixpanel account).
3. Click **Save**.
</Steps>

### What Mixpanel tracks

Mixpanel captures detailed information about specific actions people take in Tallyfy:
- Viewing a template
- Completing a step
- Launching a process
- Engaging with specific documents

![Mixpanel Event Categories example](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/file-lfm4qkBjDC.png)

:::caution[Privacy with Mixpanel]
Mixpanel collects detailed event data in your Mixpanel account - including user information. Make sure your company's privacy policy covers this data collection.
:::

### Using the Analytics Data

Once you're connected, here's what you can do with Google Analytics or Mixpanel:
- Build custom reports about Tallyfy usage
- Create real-time dashboards to spot trends
- Set up alerts when usage patterns change
- Export data for deeper analysis
