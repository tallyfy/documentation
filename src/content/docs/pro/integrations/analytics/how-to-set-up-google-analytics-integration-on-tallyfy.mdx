## Tracking Template/Process Usage with Analytics Tools

You can connect Tallyfy to web analytics tools like Google Analytics or Mixpanel. This lets you see how people in your organization (or guests) are using your Tallyfy documentation, templates, and processes.

### Why track usage?

- **See what people use**: Find out which templates or documents are viewed most often.
- **Measure engagement**: See how much time people spend on certain pages or steps.
- **Find popular processes**: Identify which workflows get used the most (or least).
- **Understand usage**: Learn when and how teams access process information.
- **Check value**: See if using certain processes correlates with better results.

## Setting up Google Analytics (GA)

### What you need

- A Google Analytics account where you have admin rights.
- A Tallyfy Professional or Enterprise plan.
- Administrator permission in Tallyfy.

### Step 1: Set up Custom Dimensions in Google Analytics

*Important: This step must be done first inside your Google Analytics account.* Tallyfy needs these dimensions set up correctly to send data properly.

1. Log into Google Analytics.
2. Go to **Admin** (gear icon) > find the **Property** column > **Custom Definitions** > **Custom Dimensions**.
3. Create **five** new custom dimensions. You *must* configure them exactly like this:

| Name          | Index | Scope   | Active |
|---------------|-------|---------|--------|
| User Name     | 1     | User    | Yes    |
| User Email    | 2     | User    | Yes    |
| Process Name  | 3     | Session | Yes    |
| Event Type    | 4     | Hit     | Yes    |
| Event Details | 5     | Hit     | Yes    |

:::caution[Match settings EXACTLY!]
Make sure the names, index numbers (1-5), and scope match the table above perfectly. If these aren't set up correctly in GA, the data from Tallyfy won't work.
:::

### Step 2: Get your Google Analytics Tracking ID

1. In Google Analytics, go to **Admin** > **Property Settings**.
2. Find and copy your **Tracking ID** (it looks like UA-XXXXX-Y).

### Step 3: Connect Tallyfy to Google Analytics

<Steps>
1. In Tallyfy, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**.
2. Find and click the **Analytics** section.
3. Paste your Google Analytics Tracking ID (from Step 2) into the box provided.
4. Click **Save**.
</Steps>

Now, Tallyfy will start sending usage data (like page views and events) to your Google Analytics account.

## (Optional) Tracking Specific Users with User ID in GA

Google Analytics has an optional feature called "User ID" that lets you track activity from the *same* logged-in user across different devices or sessions more accurately.

### Step 1: Turn On User ID in Google Analytics

1. In Google Analytics, go to **Admin**.
2. Under **Property**, find **Tracking Info** > **User ID**.

3. Read the policy and turn the feature **ON**.

### Step 2: Create a User ID View in Google Analytics

1. Follow the steps on the User ID page in GA to create a new **View**.
2. This view will specifically show data tracked using the User ID.

:::note[Data takes time]
Google says it can take 24-48 hours for data to start showing up in a new User ID view.

## Setting up Mixpanel Integration

Mixpanel is another analytics tool you can connect to Tallyfy, often used for tracking specific events.

### How to connect Mixpanel

<Steps>
1. In Tallyfy, go to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Analytics**.
2. Enter your **Mixpanel Project Token** (you get this from your Mixpanel account).
3. Click **Save**.
</Steps>

### What Mixpanel tracks

Mixpanel can give you detailed information about specific actions people take in Tallyfy, like:
- Viewing a template.
- Completing a step.
- Launching a process.
- Engaging with specific documents.

:::caution[Privacy with Mixpanel]
Be aware that Mixpanel will collect detailed event data in your Mixpanel account. Make sure your company's privacy policy covers this data collection, as it might include user information.
:::

### Using the Analytics Data

Once connected, you can use Google Analytics or Mixpanel to:
- Build custom reports about Tallyfy usage.
- Create dashboards to see trends.
- Set up alerts for important usage changes.
- Export the data for more analysis.
