## How to set up Google Analytics or Mixpanel to record engagement data

To begin, you'll need to create 5 custom items in your Google Analytics instance. Make sure you enter the details exactly as shown, including the custom dimension name, index, and scope. Here's an example of what it should look like:

Next, you'll need to retrieve the Tracker ID from your Google Analytics account. It should be in the format of "UA-#####-#". Here's how you can find it:

1. Click on "Settings" in the top menu.
2. Click on "Integrations".
3. Click the "Analytics" section and enter your Tracker ID in the provided box. Then, click "SAVE".

That's it! Your events and views will now be saved in your own Google Analytics instance.

## Tracking specific users and sessions

In addition to Google Analytics, Tallyfy also offers a Mixpanel integration for tracking specific user and session activity. Although it requires some custom steps to set up, it provides valuable user-level data for more detailed views.

Here's how you can set it up:

1. On your Google Analytics dashboard, open the "Admin" tab on the left pane.

Please note that there may be a delay of 1 to 2 days before data starts appearing in your view, according to Google.

## Tracking engagement stats on Mixpanel

If you're using Mixpanel to track events, you'll be able to see highly specific events in categories, providing valuable insights into how your templates are being viewed and by whom. Here's an example of what you can expect:

Please be aware that if you integrate Mixpanel, you'll need to handle any user-specific privacy issues on your end, as Mixpanel collects all the data in your Mixpanel instance. Tallyfy does not control this.

And that's it! You're all set up to start tracking engagement data with Tallyfy and Google Analytics.
