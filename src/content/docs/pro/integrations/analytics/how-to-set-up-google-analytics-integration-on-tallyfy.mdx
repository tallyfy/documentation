## Connect Google Analytics or Mixpanel to Tallyfy

Tallyfy can send usage data directly to your own Google Analytics (GA4) or Mixpanel account. Paste your Measurement ID or project token, and you'll see how your team interacts with templates, processes, and tasks - right inside your analytics dashboards.

This works for both internal members and guests[^1].

### Why bother tracking?

- **See what gets used**: Which templates or documents get the most views?
- **Spot trends**: Identify your busiest workflows and when people access them
- **Measure engagement**: Track page views, task completions, and process launches over time

## Setting up Google Analytics (GA4)

### What you need

- A Google Analytics 4 account with admin rights
- A Tallyfy Pro or Enterprise plan
- Administrator permission in Tallyfy

### Step 1: Get your GA4 Measurement ID

1. In Google Analytics, go to **Admin** > **Data Streams**
2. Select your web data stream and copy the **Measurement ID** (format: `G-XXXXXXXXXX`)

### Step 2: Connect Tallyfy to Google Analytics

<Steps>
1. In Tallyfy, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Find the **Google Analytics** section
3. Paste your Measurement ID into the **Tracking ID** field
4. Click **Save**
</Steps>

Done. Tallyfy starts sending page views and events to your GA4 property.

### What Tallyfy sends to GA4

Tallyfy automatically sends events enriched with custom dimensions[^2] including:

| Dimension | Event Parameter | Description |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| Organization ID | `orgId` | Your Tallyfy organization |
| Task ID | `taskId` | Specific task being viewed |
| Process ID | `processId` | Active process instance |
| Template ID | `blueprintId` | Template being accessed |
| Template Step ID | `blueprintStepId` | Specific step in a template |

Each event also includes user context (user ID, email, role) and session details automatically. You can create custom dimensions in GA4 under **Admin** > **Data display** > **Custom definitions** to surface these parameters in your reports.

### Cross-device user tracking (optional)

Tallyfy sends a `user_id` with every event, which means GA4 can track the same person across their laptop, phone, and tablet. Go to **Admin** > **Reporting identity** in GA4 to configure how users are identified - blended, observed, or device-based.

:::note[Data takes time]
GA4 typically takes 24-48 hours to process new data. Don't worry if nothing shows up right away.

## Setting up Mixpanel

### How to connect Mixpanel

<Steps>
1. In Tallyfy, go to **Settings** > **Integrations**
2. Find the **Mixpanel** section and enter your **Mixpanel Project Token**
3. Click **Save**
</Steps>

### What Mixpanel tracks

Mixpanel captures the same events Tallyfy sends to GA4, including:
- Page views across templates and processes
- Task completions
- Process launches
- Template views

Mixpanel also receives user profile data (name, email, role) and organization context, so you can build user-level funnels and cohort analysis.

:::caution[Privacy notice]
Mixpanel collects detailed event data including user information. Make sure your company's privacy policy covers this.
