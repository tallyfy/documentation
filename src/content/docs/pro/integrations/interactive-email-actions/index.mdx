## How can I take action on Tallyfy tasks directly from email?

Tallyfy continuously explores innovative approaches to enhance workflow management efficiency through advanced email integration capabilities.

Interactive email actions represent an exciting development area enabling users to perform Tallyfy task actions directly within email clients without requiring context switching or application navigation. This functionality leverages technologies including **Microsoft Actionable Messages** for Outlook integration and **Gmail Markup Actions** for Gmail enhancement.

### What are interactive email actions in Tallyfy?

Interactive email actions enable task completion, input provision, and decision-making directly within email messages without external navigation requirements.

Rather than traditional email links redirecting to web pages, interactive emails present embedded buttons, simplified forms, and confirmation prompts for immediate action completion within familiar email environments.

#### Microsoft Actionable Messages

Microsoft Actionable Messages enable developers to embed "Adaptive Cards" into emails sent to Outlook users. These cards can display information and allow users to perform actions such as:
*   Clicking an "Approve" or "Reject" button for a Tallyfy approval task.
*   Adding a quick comment to a task.
*   Marking a simple task as complete.

When you interact with an Actionable Message, Outlook securely communicates your action back to the originating service (in this case, Tallyfy) to update the task. You can learn more about this technology on the [Microsoft Learn platform](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/actionable-messages/).

#### Gmail Markup Actions

Gmail utilizes `schema.org` markup (often using JSON-LD) embedded within an email's HTML. This allows Gmail to render interactive elements for the user. Key types of actions include:
*   **One-Click Actions**: For straightforward actions like confirming a subscription or approving a request directly from the email.
*   **Go-To Actions**: For more complex scenarios, these provide a button that takes the user to a specific webpage.

Similar to Microsoft's solution, when a user performs an in-app action, Gmail communicates this back to the service. For more details, you can visit the [Google Developers documentation for Gmail Markup Actions](https://developers.google.com/workspace/gmail/markup/actions/actions-overview).

### How could this benefit Tallyfy users?

Integrating these technologies could offer several advantages:

*   **Increased efficiency**: Complete common tasks like approvals or quick updates much faster, without leaving your inbox.
*   **Reduced context switching**: Stay focused on your email workflow for quick actions, minimizing disruption.
*   **Improved responsiveness**: Act on notifications immediately, especially when on mobile devices where navigating to a full web app might be less convenient.
*   **Streamlined processes**: For simple, repetitive actions, interacting directly in the email can save significant time across many tasks.

### Potential Tallyfy use cases

We envision several ways interactive email actions could enhance your Tallyfy experience:

*   **One-click approvals/rejections**: Receive an approval request email and click "Approve" or "Reject" directly in the message.
*   **Marking tasks complete**: For notification-style tasks or simple acknowledgments, a "Mark Complete" button in the email.
*   **Adding quick comments**: Reply to a task update with a comment submitted from within the email itself.
*   **Simple form submissions**: For tasks that require minimal input (e.g., a single selection or a short text response), this might be possible directly in the email.

### What's next?

Tallyfy is currently exploring the potential of these interactive email technologies. This is not a live feature at this time, but an area of future development we are considering to further enhance your productivity. Implementation would depend on various factors, including robust security measures and ensuring a seamless user experience across different email clients that support these features.

We are excited about the possibility of bringing such interactions to your Tallyfy emails and will share more information as our exploration progresses.
