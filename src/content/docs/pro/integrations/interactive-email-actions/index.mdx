## Take action on tasks directly from email

You can't - yet. But we're working on it.

Interactive email actions would let you complete Tallyfy tasks right inside your email - approve requests, mark tasks done, add comments - without switching apps. The technology exists through **Microsoft Actionable Messages** for Outlook and **Gmail Markup Actions** for Gmail, and we're exploring how to bring it to Tallyfy.

> Tallyfy emails already include basic `schema.org` ViewAction markup, which gives Gmail a "View in Tallyfy" button. Interactive email actions would go further - letting you take action without leaving your inbox at all.

### What are interactive email actions?

Buttons and forms that work inside your email. You'd approve a request, mark a task complete, or add a comment without clicking a link or opening another tab. Traditional emails make you click through to a web page. Interactive emails bring the action to you.

#### Microsoft Actionable Messages

Microsoft embeds "Adaptive Cards" into Outlook emails. These cards display information and let you act on it:
*   Click **Approve** or **Reject** on a Tallyfy approval task
*   Add a quick comment to a task
*   Mark a simple task as complete

When you click something in the card, Outlook sends your action back to Tallyfy to update the task. Learn more on [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook/actionable-messages/).

#### Gmail Markup Actions

Gmail uses `schema.org` markup (typically JSON-LD) in the email's HTML to show interactive elements. Two main types exist:
*   **One-Click Actions**: For approvals and confirmations - one tap and you're done
*   **Go-To Actions**: For actions that need a full webpage

When you click an action, Gmail sends it back to the service. See the [Google Developers documentation](https://developers.google.com/workspace/gmail/markup/actions/actions-overview) for technical details.

### How this would benefit Tallyfy users

Switching between email and web apps slows you down. Interactive emails would fix that:

*   **Speed**: Approve requests without login screens or page loads.
*   **Focus**: Handle quick actions from your inbox without breaking your flow.
*   **Mobile-friendly**: One-tap actions instead of logging into a web app on your phone.

### Potential use cases

*   **One-click approvals/rejections**: Get an approval request, click **Approve** or **Reject**, done.
*   **Marking tasks complete**: One button in the email for tasks that just need acknowledgment.
*   **Adding quick comments**: Reply to the email and your comment gets added to the task.
*   **Simple form submissions**: Pick an option or enter a short response directly in the email.

### What's next?

This isn't live yet - we're still exploring. Interactive emails require strong security and consistent behavior across email clients, which takes time. We'll share updates as this progresses.
