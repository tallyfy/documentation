## Using the Tallyfy Slack Integration

The Tallyfy integration for Slack connects your team chat with your Tallyfy workflows. It helps turn conversations into actions by letting you create tasks and launch processes directly from Slack.

### Why connect Tallyfy and Slack?

- **Turn talk into tasks**: Easily make a Tallyfy task from any Slack message.
- **Less app switching**: Start and manage Tallyfy workflows without leaving Slack.
- **Track commitments**: Make sure action items discussed in chat get tracked properly in Tallyfy.
- **See status easily**: Check on Tallyfy tasks and processes from within Slack.
- **Keep records**: Have a clear record of tasks in Tallyfy, not just lost in chat history.
