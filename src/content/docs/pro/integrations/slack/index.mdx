## Using the Tallyfy Slack Integration

The Tallyfy integration for Slack connects your team chat with your Tallyfy workflows. It helps turn conversations into actions by letting you create tasks and launch processes directly from Slack.

### Why connect Tallyfy and Slack?

- **Turn talk into tasks**: Easily make a Tallyfy task from any Slack message.
- **Less app switching**: Start and manage Tallyfy workflows without leaving Slack.
- **Track commitments**: Make sure action items discussed in chat get tracked properly in Tallyfy.
- **See status easily**: Check on Tallyfy tasks and processes from within Slack.
- **Keep records**: Have a clear record of tasks in Tallyfy, not just lost in chat history.

### What you can do

|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Create Task        | Turn any Slack message into a Tallyfy task with one click.          |

| Get Notifications  | Receive Slack alerts for Tallyfy tasks (assigned, done, due soon). |
| Link Conversations | Keep a connection between the Slack message and the Tallyfy task.    |

5. Click **Create**. The task is created in Tallyfy, linked to the message.

#### Launching a Tallyfy Process

1. In any Slack channel or message, type `/tallyfy launch`.
2. A menu will appear. Choose the Tallyfy template you want to launch.
3. Fill out any required starting information.
4. Click **Launch**.

#### Checking Your Tallyfy Tasks

1. In any Slack channel or message, type `/tallyfy tasks`.

3. Click on a task to see details or update it.
4. You'll also get automatic notifications in Slack about your tasks.

### Troubleshooting Tips

If the integration isn't working:
- Make sure your Tallyfy account has permission to create tasks/launch processes.
- Check if the Tallyfy app is properly authorized in Slack.
- Ask your IT team if any firewall settings might be blocking notifications.
- If problems continue, contact Tallyfy support.

## Microsoft Teams and our approach to chat integrations like Slack

We understand that users are interested in integrations with various chat platforms, including Microsoft Teams, to perform actions like approvals directly within their chat applications. While our current Slack integration allows you to launch processes and create tasks, it does not extend to pushing all reminders or task updates into Slack, and a similar approach would apply to other chat platforms like Microsoft Teams.

Our philosophy is to avoid overwhelming users with notifications in chat applications. We believe there are more effective ways to stay updated without contributing to notification fatigue:

*   **Chat is for real-time human interaction**: Business chat platforms are designed primarily for direct communication between people. Introducing too many automated messages can dilute this primary purpose and lead to users ignoring important bot-driven updates.
*   **Avoiding overload**: Email inboxes are often overloaded. Simply shifting this overload to chat applications can make the problem worse, as chat implies a greater sense of urgency.
*   **Existing notification methods**: Tallyfy already offers several ways to stay informed:
    *   You can configure [daily email digests](/products/pro/settings/personal-settings/how-can-i-manage-email-notifications-in-tallyfy/) that summarize your due and overdue tasks.
    *   The [watching items](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/organize-processes/how-can-i-favorite-and-filter-processes-on-tallyfy/) feature (by favoriting) allows you to curate a list of specific tasks, processes, or templates you want to follow closely and receive tailored notifications for.
*   **Controlling inbound flow**: The volume of automated messages can grow exponentially, potentially leading users to disengage from robot-driven chat entirely.

### Our future vision for chat integrations

We are designing a new approach for chat integrations (for Slack, Microsoft Teams, and potentially others like WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger in the future) that prioritizes user-initiated interactions.

*   **User-initiated conversations**: Instead of Tallyfy pushing messages *to* you, you will be able to start a conversation *with* Tallyfy via a bot or an intelligent AI system within your chat platform.
*   **Intelligent assistance**: You can ask questions, and the bot will provide answers, pointing you to the relevant tasks, processes, or information within Tallyfy as needed.

Alongside user-initiated chat, we are also [exploring interactive email actions](/products/pro/integrations/interactive-email-actions/) that would allow you to complete certain Tallyfy tasks directly from within email clients like Outlook and Gmail, further reducing the need to switch applications for quick actions.

:::note[Currently in Beta]
This new user-initiated chat integration model is currently in the design and beta stage and is not yet live or available for general use. We are sharing our thinking to provide insight into our future direction.
