## How does the Tallyfy Slack integration work?

The Tallyfy Slack integration seamlessly connects team communication with workflow management, enabling direct task creation and process launching from within Slack channels.

This integration transforms conversational discussions into actionable workflow items, eliminating context switching while maintaining comprehensive tracking capabilities across both platforms.

### Why should I connect Tallyfy with Slack?

Integrating Tallyfy with Slack delivers significant productivity benefits by bridging communication gaps and workflow execution:

- **Convert Conversations to Tasks**: Transform any Slack message into trackable Tallyfy tasks instantly
- **Eliminate App Switching**: Launch and manage complete Tallyfy workflows without leaving Slack environment
- **Ensure Accountability**: Guarantee action items discussed in chat receive proper tracking in Tallyfy systems
- **Streamline Status Updates**: Access real-time Tallyfy task and process status directly within Slack channels
- **Maintain Workflow Records**: Preserve comprehensive task documentation in Tallyfy rather than losing information in chat history

### What you can do

| Feature            | Description                                                          |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Create Task        | Turn any Slack message into a Tallyfy task with one click.          |
| Launch Process     | Start a Tallyfy process template from a Slack conversation.        |
| Get Notifications  | Receive Slack alerts for Tallyfy tasks (assigned, done, due soon). |
| Link Conversations | Keep a connection between the Slack message and the Tallyfy task.    |
| Track Progress     | View and update task status in either Tallyfy or Slack.              |

### Setting it up

#### Requirements

- A Tallyfy Professional or Enterprise account.
- A Slack workspace where you can install apps (might need admin help).

#### Installation Steps

1. Find the Tallyfy app:
   - On the [Tallyfy integrations page](https://tallyfy.com/integrations/)
   - Or in the [Slack App Directory](https://slack.com/apps/AF15436JJ-tallyfy)
2. Click **Add to Slack**.
3. Choose the Slack workspace you want to connect.
4. Review the permissions Tallyfy needs and click **Authorize** (or similar).
5. Follow the steps to connect your Tallyfy account to Slack.

#### Creating a Task from a Slack Message

1. Find the Slack message you want to turn into a task.
2. Hover over the message and click the **More actions** menu (three dots).
3. Choose **Create Tallyfy Task**.
4. Fill in the task details (name, who to assign it to, due date, etc.).
5. Click **Create**. The task is created in Tallyfy, linked to the message.

#### Launching a Tallyfy Process

1. In any Slack channel or message, type `/tallyfy launch`.
2. A menu will appear. Choose the Tallyfy template you want to launch.
3. Fill out any required starting information.
4. Click **Launch**.

#### Checking Your Tallyfy Tasks

1. In any Slack channel or message, type `/tallyfy tasks`.
2. You'll see a list of your current Tallyfy tasks.
3. Click on a task to see details or update it.
4. You'll also get automatic notifications in Slack about your tasks.

### Team-wide process notifications

:::note[Current limitations for team notifications]
Currently, Slack notifications are sent only to individual task assignees, not entire teams. To enable team-wide visibility:

**Manual workaround for team notifications:**
1. Add a dedicated Slack channel for process updates (e.g., #tallyfy-updates)
2. Configure webhooks to post to this channel when processes change
3. Set up individual process notifications manually per template
4. Consider using Zapier to route Tallyfy webhooks to Slack channels

**Planned enhancement:** Template-level Slack channel mapping is on our roadmap. This will allow automatic team notifications for all processes launched from a specific template.

### Troubleshooting Tips

If the integration isn't working:
- Make sure your Tallyfy account has permission to create tasks/launch processes.
- Check if the Tallyfy app is properly authorized in Slack.
- Ask your IT team if any firewall settings might be blocking notifications.
- For team-wide notifications, verify webhook configuration in both Tallyfy and Slack.
- If problems continue, contact Tallyfy support.

## Microsoft Teams and our approach to chat integrations like Slack

We understand that users are interested in integrations with various chat platforms, including Microsoft Teams, to perform actions like approvals directly within their chat applications. While our current Slack integration allows you to launch processes and create tasks, it does not extend to pushing all reminders or task updates into Slack, and a similar approach would apply to other chat platforms like Microsoft Teams.

Our philosophy is to avoid overwhelming users with notifications in chat applications. We believe there are more effective ways to stay updated without contributing to notification fatigue:

*   **Chat is for real-time human interaction**: Business chat platforms are designed primarily for direct communication between people. Introducing too many automated messages can dilute this primary purpose and lead to users ignoring important bot-driven updates.
*   **Avoiding overload**: Email inboxes are often overloaded. Simply shifting this overload to chat applications can make the problem worse, as chat implies a greater sense of urgency.
*   **Existing notification methods**: Tallyfy already offers several ways to stay informed:
    *   You can configure [daily email digests](/products/pro/settings/personal-settings/how-can-i-manage-email-notifications-in-tallyfy/) that summarize your due and overdue tasks.
    *   The [watching items](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/organize-processes/how-can-i-favorite-and-filter-processes-on-tallyfy/) feature (by favoriting) allows you to curate a list of specific tasks, processes, or templates you want to follow closely and receive tailored notifications for.
*   **Controlling inbound flow**: The volume of automated messages can grow exponentially, potentially leading users to disengage from robot-driven chat entirely.

### Our future vision for chat integrations

We are designing a new approach for chat integrations (for Slack, Microsoft Teams, and potentially others like WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger in the future) that prioritizes user-initiated interactions.

*   **User-initiated conversations**: Instead of Tallyfy pushing messages *to* you, you will be able to start a conversation *with* Tallyfy via a bot or an intelligent AI system within your chat platform.
*   **Intelligent assistance**: You can ask questions, and the bot will provide answers, pointing you to the relevant tasks, processes, or information within Tallyfy as needed.

Alongside user-initiated chat, we are also [exploring interactive email actions](/products/pro/integrations/interactive-email-actions/) that would allow you to complete certain Tallyfy tasks directly from within email clients like Outlook and Gmail, further reducing the need to switch applications for quick actions.

:::note[Currently in Beta]
This new user-initiated chat integration model is currently in the design and beta stage and is not yet live or available for general use. We are sharing our thinking to provide insight into our future direction.
