title: Choosing the right integration approach
---

## How do I choose between API, middleware, and AI for Tallyfy integrations?

Tallyfy offers three distinct integration approaches - direct API, middleware platforms, and AI-powered code generation. Choose based on your technical capabilities, timeline, and long-term maintenance preferences.

Each approach has specific advantages depending on your organization's needs. Direct API provides maximum control, middleware offers visual workflows without coding, and AI accelerates custom development by generating integration code automatically.

### When should I use direct API integration?

**Choose direct API when you have**:
- In-house development team with API experience
- Need for maximum performance and customization
- Complex business logic requirements
- Budget for ongoing code maintenance

**Direct API is ideal for**:
- Building custom applications that embed Tallyfy workflows
- High-volume automated process launches (1000+ per day)
- Complex data transformations before sending to Tallyfy
- Mission-critical integrations requiring millisecond response times

**Example scenario**: A software company integrates their customer onboarding system to automatically create Tallyfy processes for each new enterprise client, with custom logic based on contract type and service level.

### When should I use middleware platforms?

**Choose middleware when you have**:
- Limited or no coding resources
- Need to connect multiple systems quickly
- Preference for visual workflow builders
- Standard integration patterns (not highly custom)

**Popular middleware options**:
- **[Make (Integromat)](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/make/)**: Visual scenarios with advanced data manipulation
- **[n8n](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/n8n/)**: Self-hosted option for data privacy requirements
- **[Power Automate](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/)**: Ideal for Microsoft ecosystem integration

**Example scenario**: An HR department uses middleware to automatically create employee onboarding processes in Tallyfy whenever a new hire is added to their HRIS system.

### When should I use AI-powered code generation?

**Choose AI code generation when you have**:
- Developers who want to accelerate integration development
- Clear requirements but limited time to write code
- Need for custom integration logic beyond middleware capabilities
- Preference for maintainable, documented code

**AI code generation advantages**:
- Generates working integration code in minutes instead of days
- Creates proper error handling and logging automatically
- Produces well-documented code that developers can modify
- Supports multiple programming languages (Python, JavaScript, etc.)

**How it works**:
1. Describe your integration requirements to Claude or ChatGPT
2. AI generates complete integration code with Tallyfy API calls
3. Developer reviews, tests, and deploys the code
4. Maintain and enhance the code as needed

**Example scenario**: A logistics company uses Claude to generate Python code that monitors their warehouse management system and creates Tallyfy shipping processes with complex conditional logic based on order characteristics.

:::tip[Pro tip: Start with AI, refine with developers]
Many organizations use AI to generate the initial integration code, then have their developers customize it for specific business requirements. This hybrid approach can reduce development time by 70-80%.

### Integration approach comparison matrix

| Factor | Direct API | Middleware | AI Code Generation |
|--------|------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Technical skill required** | High (developers) | Low (no-code) | Medium (review code) |
| **Setup time** | Days to weeks | Hours to days | Hours to days |
| **Customization level** | Unlimited | Limited by platform | High |
| **Ongoing maintenance** | Code updates needed | Platform manages | Code updates needed |
| **Cost** | Development time | Monthly subscription | AI tool + dev time |
| **Performance** | Fastest | Good | Fast |
| **Best for** | Complex, high-volume | Standard workflows | Custom but quick |

### How do I decide which approach is right for me?

Ask yourself these questions:

1. **Do you have developers available?**
   - Yes → Consider API or AI generation
   - No → Use middleware

2. **Is this a one-time setup or ongoing project?**
   - One-time → AI generation might be fastest
   - Ongoing → Consider maintenance requirements

3. **How complex is your integration?**
   - Simple (if-this-then-that) → Middleware
   - Complex logic → API or AI-generated code

4. **What's your timeline?**
   - Need it this week → Middleware or AI
   - Have a month → Direct API for maximum control

### Can I combine multiple approaches?

Yes! Many organizations use hybrid approaches:

- **Middleware + API**: Use middleware for simple automations while building custom API integrations for complex workflows
- **AI + Middleware**: Generate custom webhook endpoints with AI, then connect them via middleware
- **Phased approach**: Start with middleware for quick wins, then migrate critical integrations to API

:::note[Migration is always possible]
Starting with one approach doesn't lock you in. Many customers begin with middleware for rapid deployment, then selectively migrate high-volume or complex integrations to direct API as their needs evolve.
