title: Choosing the right integration approach

## How do I choose between API, middleware, and AI for Tallyfy integrations?

You've got three ways to connect Tallyfy with your other systems - direct API, middleware platforms, and AI-powered code generation. The right choice depends on your tech team, timeline, and how much control you need.

Here's the thing: each approach shines in different situations. Want total control? Go API. Need something working by Monday without writing code? Middleware's your friend. Have developers who need to build something custom fast? Let AI write the initial code.

### When should I use direct API integration?

**Choose direct API when you have**:
- In-house development team with API experience
- Need for maximum performance and customization
- Complex business logic requirements
- Budget for ongoing code maintenance

**Direct API is ideal for**:
- Building custom applications that embed Tallyfy workflows
- High-volume automated process launches (1000+ per day)
- Complex data transformations before sending to Tallyfy
- Mission-critical integrations requiring millisecond response times

**Example scenario**: A software company connects their customer onboarding system to automatically launch Tallyfy processes for each new enterprise client. The integration reads contract types, pulls service levels, and sets up the exact workflow needed - all in under 2 seconds.

### When should I use middleware platforms?

**Choose middleware when you have**:
- Limited or no coding resources
- Need to connect multiple systems quickly
- Preference for visual workflow builders
- Standard integration patterns (not highly custom)

**Popular middleware options**:
- **[Zapier](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/zapier/)**: Visual scenarios with advanced data manipulation
- **[n8n](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/n8n/)**: Self-hosted option for data privacy requirements
- **[Power Automate](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/)**: Perfect if you're already using Microsoft 365

**Example scenario**: An HR team sets up a 15-minute automation where their HRIS system triggers Tallyfy to create complete onboarding workflows. New hire added at 9 AM? Their manager has tasks assigned by 9:01.

### When should I use AI-powered code generation?

**Choose AI code generation when you have**:
- Developers who want to accelerate integration development
- Clear requirements but limited time to write code
- Need for custom integration logic beyond middleware capabilities
- Preference for maintainable, documented code

**AI code generation advantages**:
- Working integration code in 10-20 minutes (not days)
- Error handling and logging included automatically
- Well-documented code your team can actually understand
- Works with Python, JavaScript, Ruby - whatever you use

**How it works**:
1. Tell Claude or ChatGPT exactly what you need
2. AI writes the complete integration code with proper API calls
3. Your developer reviews, tests, and deploys
4. Tweak and enhance as your needs evolve

**Example scenario**: A logistics company needed complex shipping workflows that changed based on weight, destination, and carrier. Their developer described the requirements to Claude, got working Python code in 15 minutes, and had it running in production that afternoon.

:::tip[Pro tip: Start with AI, refine with developers]
Smart teams are using AI to generate their initial integration code, then having developers customize the specific bits. You're looking at 70-80% less development time - that's days saved, not hours.

### Integration approach comparison matrix

| Factor | Direct API | Middleware | AI Code Generation |
|--------|------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Technical skill required** | High (developers) | Low (no-code) | Medium (review code) |
| **Setup time** | Days to weeks | Hours to days | Hours to days |
| **Customization level** | Unlimited | Limited by platform | High |
| **Ongoing maintenance** | Code updates needed | Platform manages | Code updates needed |
| **Cost** | Development time | Monthly subscription | AI tool + dev time |
| **Performance** | Fastest | Good | Fast |
| **Best for** | Complex, high-volume | Standard workflows | Custom but quick |

### How do I decide which approach is right for me?

Four questions will point you in the right direction:

1. **Do you have developers available?**
   - Yes → Consider API or AI generation
   - No → Middleware is your only real option

2. **Is this a one-time setup or ongoing project?**
   - One-time → AI generation gets you there fastest
   - Ongoing → Think about who'll maintain it

3. **How complex is your integration?**
   - Simple (if-this-then-that) → Middleware handles it fine
   - Complex logic → You'll need API or AI-generated code

4. **What's your timeline?**
   - Need it this week → Middleware or AI
   - Have a month → Direct API gives you the most control

### Can I combine multiple approaches?

Absolutely. Many teams mix and match:

- **Middleware + API**: Run your simple automations through Zapier while your high-volume stuff goes direct to the API
- **AI + Middleware**: Let AI build custom webhook endpoints, then wire them up with middleware (clever, right?)
- **Phased approach**: Start with middleware today, get it working, then move the heavy-duty integrations to API later

:::note[Migration is always possible]
You're never locked in. Plenty of teams start with middleware to get something working fast, then move their high-volume or complex integrations to direct API when it makes sense. No need to rebuild from scratch.
