title: Using Tallyfy MCP Server with Claude (Text Chat)
---

import { Steps, CardGrid, LinkTitleCard } from "~/components";

:::note[MCP Client Compatibility]
An MCP server can be used by any MCP client that supports it. Although you can use Tallyfy's MCP server with common AI platforms like OpenAI, Claude or Microsoft Copilot Studio - the UI and ability to do useful work in real life is limited by many factors which are highlighted in this page. Tallyfy is developing its own fully-featured chat UI which will solve all the major problems of using MCP servers with mainstream text-chat AI providers. However, to start using MCP immediately - we recommend adding it to your AI subscription so that you can get the value and benefits immediately. You can additionally use the fully featured Tallyfy-specific AI interface when we launch it.

## Overview

Claude Desktop, developed by Anthropic, was the first AI assistant to natively support Model Context Protocol (MCP). Launched alongside MCP in November 2024, Claude Desktop provides seamless integration with MCP servers, enabling direct access to your Tallyfy workflows, local files, and external tools through natural language commands.

This guide demonstrates how to configure Tallyfy's MCP server with Claude Desktop, explore practical use cases, understand limitations, and leverage Claude's unique capabilities for workflow management.

:::warning[Important: Claude Desktop vs Claude Computer Use]
This article covers **Claude Desktop's text-chat interface with MCP integration** - where you interact with Claude through natural language to access Tallyfy data via MCP servers. This is different from [Claude Computer Use](/products/pro/integrations/computer-ai-agents/vendors/claude-computer-use/), which allows Claude to visually perceive and control computer interfaces (mouse, keyboard, screenshots).

**Key differences:**
- **Claude Desktop + MCP** (this article): Text-based chat that connects to data sources and APIs
- **Claude Computer Use**: Visual perception and control of desktop applications through screenshots and mouse/keyboard actions

Both can work with Tallyfy, but serve different purposes:
- Use **Claude Desktop + MCP** for data queries, analysis, and API-based automation
- Use **Claude Computer Use** for automating visual UI tasks that require seeing and clicking interface elements

## Setting up Tallyfy MCP Server with Claude Desktop

<Steps>

1. **Install Claude Desktop**
   
   Download Claude Desktop from [claude.ai/download](https://claude.ai/download) for your operating system (macOS or Windows).

2. **Locate the configuration file**
   
   The MCP configuration file location varies by operating system:
   
   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
   
   If the file doesn't exist, Claude will create it when you first edit the configuration.

3. **Create the Tallyfy MCP server**
   
   First, create a local directory for your MCP server:
   ```bash
   mkdir ~/tallyfy-mcp-server
   cd ~/tallyfy-mcp-server
   npm init -y
   npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk axios
   ```

4. **Implement the server script**
   
   Create a file named `tallyfy-server.js`:
   
   ```javascript
   const { Server } = require('@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/index.js');
   const { StdioServerTransport } = require('@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js');
   const axios = require('axios');
   
   // Initialize Tallyfy API client
   const TALLYFY_API_KEY = process.env.TALLYFY_API_KEY;
   const TALLYFY_API_URL = 'https://mcp.tallyfy.com';
   
   const server = new Server({
     name: 'tallyfy-mcp',
     version: '1.0.0',
   });
   
   // Tool to search for tasks
   server.setRequestHandler('tools/call', async (request) => {
     if (request.params.name === 'search_tasks') {
       const { query, status } = request.params.arguments;
       
       const response = await axios.get(`${TALLYFY_API_URL}/tasks`, {
         headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${TALLYFY_API_KEY}` },
         params: { q: query, status }
       });
       
       return {
         content: [{ 
           type: 'text', 
           text: JSON.stringify(response.data, null, 2) 
         }]
       };
     }
   });
   
   // List available tools
   server.setRequestHandler('tools/list', async () => {
     return {
       tools: [{
         name: 'search_tasks',
         description: 'Search for tasks in Tallyfy',
         inputSchema: {
           type: 'object',
           properties: {
             query: { type: 'string', description: 'Search query' },
             status: { type: 'string', enum: ['open', 'completed', 'all'] }
           }
         }
       }]
     };
   });
   
   // Start the server
   const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
   server.connect(transport);
   ```

5. **Configure Claude Desktop**
   
   Edit your `claude_desktop_config.json` file:
   
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "tallyfy": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["/Users/username/tallyfy-mcp-server/tallyfy-server.js"],
         "env": {
           "TALLYFY_API_KEY": "your-tallyfy-api-key-here"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   
   Replace:
   - `/Users/username/` with your actual home directory path
   - `your-tallyfy-api-key-here` with your Tallyfy API key

6. **Restart Claude Desktop**
   
   Completely quit Claude Desktop (Cmd+Q on macOS or close all windows on Windows) and relaunch it.

7. **Verify the connection**
   
   Look for the tools icon (ðŸ”¨) in the bottom of the Claude chat interface. Click it to see available Tallyfy tools.
   
   Test with a simple query:
   ```
   "Search for all open tasks in Tallyfy"
   ```

</Steps>

- Must manually refresh to see updates
- Cannot monitor real-time process progress

**Workaround**: Set up periodic checks or use webhooks with a separate notification system.

### 3. Complex form interactions

**Challenge**: Rich form inputs don't translate well to text.

**Example limitations:**
- Multi-select dropdowns require listing all options
- File uploads need separate handling
- Date/time pickers become text input

### 4. Authentication scope

**Challenge**: Single API key authentication.

**Limitations:**
- Actions performed under one user context
- Limited ability to impersonate other users
- Audit trails show API key owner as actor

## Ideal use cases for Claude Desktop + Tallyfy MCP

### 1. Morning workflow review

**Strength**: Quick status checks and prioritization.

**Example routine:**
```
"Good morning! Show me all tasks due today, any overdue items, and processes that need my attention. Create a prioritized action list."
```

Claude can create a comprehensive morning briefing with actionable insights.

### 2. Process analysis and optimization

**Strength**: Deep analysis of workflow patterns.

**Example:**
```
"Analyze the last 50 completed 'Customer Onboarding' processes. Identify the steps with longest completion times and suggest optimizations."
```

Claude can identify bottlenecks and provide data-driven recommendations.

**Strength**: Creating comprehensive process documentation.

**Example:**
```
"Generate a detailed SOP document for our 'Invoice Processing' template, including all steps, responsible parties, and average completion times."
```

Claude can create well-structured documentation combining Tallyfy data with best practices.

### 4. Intelligent task routing

**Strength**: Complex decision-making for task assignments.

**Example:**
```
"Review the skills and current workload of team members, then suggest optimal task assignments for the next week's projects."
```

Claude can balance multiple factors to optimize team productivity.

### 5. Compliance reporting

**Strength**: Generating audit-ready reports.

**Example:**
```
"Create a compliance report showing all 'Data Access Request' processes from last quarter, including completion times and any SLA violations."
```

Claude can compile detailed reports with analysis and recommendations.

## Combining Claude MCP with Claude Computer Use

While this article focuses on Claude's text-based MCP integration, you can create powerful automation workflows by combining it with [Claude Computer Use](/products/pro/integrations/computer-ai-agents/vendors/claude-computer-use/):

### Complementary capabilities

**Claude MCP excels at:**
- Querying and analyzing Tallyfy data via API
- Bulk operations across multiple records
- Generating reports and insights
- Making data-driven decisions

**Claude Computer Use excels at:**
- Interacting with visual interfaces
- Filling forms in third-party applications
- Navigating complex UI workflows
- Handling applications without APIs

### Example hybrid workflow

**Scenario**: Monthly compliance reporting requiring both data analysis and visual form submission.

**Step 1: Claude MCP**
```
"Analyze all completed audit processes this month, identify any non-compliance issues, and prepare a summary report with statistics."
```

**Step 2: Claude Computer Use**
```
"Open the government compliance portal in the browser, navigate to the monthly report section, and fill in the form with the statistics from the report."
```

### Best practices for hybrid automation

1. **Use MCP for data operations**: Leverage API access for efficient data retrieval and processing
2. **Use Computer Use for UI-only tasks**: Reserve visual automation for applications without API access
3. **Pass data between modes**: Use files or clipboard to transfer data between MCP and Computer Use sessions
4. **Monitor costs**: Computer Use with screenshots is more expensive than MCP API calls
5. **Design for reliability**: MCP operations are more deterministic than visual UI automation

### Implementation considerations

When designing workflows that use both capabilities:

- Start with MCP for data gathering and preparation
- Switch to Computer Use only when visual interaction is required
- Return to MCP for final data validation and storage
- Document which parts of the workflow use which capability
- Test failure points and implement appropriate fallbacks

This hybrid approach maximizes efficiency while ensuring you can automate even the most complex workflows that span both API-accessible and UI-only systems.

## Security considerations

When using Claude Desktop with Tallyfy:

1. **Local configuration security**
   - Store API keys in environment variables, not plaintext
   - Restrict file permissions on `claude_desktop_config.json`
   - Use separate API keys for different environments

2. **MCP server isolation**
   - Run MCP servers with minimal permissions
   - Implement request validation in your server code
   - Log all API calls for audit purposes

3. **Data handling**
   - Be cautious about sensitive data in conversations
   - Claude Desktop stores conversation history locally
   - Consider data retention policies

4. **Network security**
   - Use HTTPS for all API communications
   - Implement request rate limiting
   - Monitor for unusual access patterns

## Advanced configuration

### Running multiple MCP servers

Claude Desktop supports multiple simultaneous MCP connections:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tallyfy": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["~/tallyfy-mcp-server/server.js"],
      "env": { "TALLYFY_API_KEY": "key-1" }
    },
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "~/Documents"]
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": { "GITHUB_TOKEN": "ghp_xxx" }
    }
  }
}
```

### Custom server development tips

1. **Use TypeScript for better type safety**
   ```typescript
   import { Server } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/index.js';
   import { TallyfyClient } from './tallyfy-client';
   ```

2. **Implement comprehensive error handling**
   ```javascript
   try {
     const result = await tallyfyApi.call();
     return { content: [{ type: 'text', text: result }] };
   } catch (error) {
     return { 
       error: { 
         code: 'TALLYFY_API_ERROR', 
         message: error.message 
       } 
     };
   }
   ```

3. **Add request logging for debugging**
   ```javascript
   console.error(`[Tallyfy MCP] ${new Date().toISOString()} - ${request.method}`);
   ```

## Known issues and workarounds (January 2025)

1. **Windows path handling**: Use forward slashes in paths or escaped backslashes
2. **Large response truncation**: Paginate results for queries returning many items
3. **Connection timeouts**: Implement retry logic for API calls
