:::note[MCP Client Compatibility]
An MCP server can be used by any MCP client that supports it. Although you can use Tallyfy's MCP server with common AI platforms like OpenAI, Claude or Microsoft Copilot Studio - the UI and ability to do useful work in real life is limited by many factors which are highlighted in this page. Tallyfy is developing its own fully-featured chat UI which will solve all the major problems of using MCP servers with mainstream text-chat AI providers. However, to start using MCP immediately - we recommend adding it to your AI subscription so that you can get the value and benefits immediately. You can also use the fully featured Tallyfy-specific AI interface when we launch it.

- Authentication happens at the Power Apps connector level using your Tallyfy API key
- DLP policies add a security layer for enterprise deployments

## Multi-agent orchestration pattern

Copilot Studio can coordinate multiple specialized agents for workflows like employee onboarding.

```d2
direction: down

Start: "User Request\n(New Employee)" {
  shape: circle
  style.fill: "#d4ffd4"
}

Primary: "Primary Agent\n(Orchestrator)" {
  shape: hexagon
  style.fill: "#5e5e5e"
  style.font-color: "#fff"
}

  shape: hexagon
  style.fill: "#f5f5f5"
}

Tallyfy: "Tallyfy\nTracker" {
  shape: cylinder
  style.fill: "#e6f3ff"
}

End: "Onboarding\nComplete" {
  shape: circle
  style.fill: "#d4ffd4"
}

Start -> Primary: "Initiate\nonboarding" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
}

Primary -> Analyze: "Parse request" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
}

Analyze -> HR: "Create HR\ntasks" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
}

Analyze -> IT: "Create IT\ntasks" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
}

Analyze -> Training: "Schedule\ntraining" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
}

HR -> Monitor: "Report\nprogress" {
  style.stroke: "#666"
  style.stroke-dash: 3
}

IT -> Monitor: "Report\nprogress" {
  style.stroke: "#666"
  style.stroke-dash: 3
}

Training -> Monitor: "Report\nprogress" {
  style.stroke: "#666"
  style.stroke-dash: 3
}

Monitor -> Tallyfy: "Update\nstatus" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
}

Tallyfy -> End: "Process\ncomplete" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
  style.stroke-width: 2
}
```

**What to notice:**
- The Primary Agent acts as an orchestrator, delegating to specialized agents
- Each agent creates and manages its tasks through Tallyfy's API
- All progress is monitored through Tallyfy's tracker view

## Enterprise deployment architecture

Recommended architecture for large organizations needing high availability and security.

```d2
direction: right

Copilot: "Copilot Studio\nAgents" {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#5e5e5e"
  style.font-color: "#fff"
}

Gateway: "API Gateway\n(with WAF)" {
  shape: hexagon
  style.fill: "#ff6c37"
  style.font-color: "#fff"
}

LB: "Load\nBalancer" {
  shape: diamond
  style.fill: "#fff3cd"
}

MCP1: "MCP Server\nInstance 1" {

  shape: cylinder
  style.fill: "#e6ffe6"
}

Copilot -> Gateway: "HTTPS\nrequests" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
  style.stroke-width: 2
}

Gateway -> LB: "Route to\navailable server" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
}

LB -> MCP1: "50% traffic" {
  style.stroke: "#666"
}

LB -> MCP2: "50% traffic" {
  style.stroke: "#666"
}

MCP1 -> API: "API calls\n(with auth)" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
}

MCP2 -> API: "API calls\n(with auth)" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
}
```

**What to notice:**
- Multiple MCP server instances provide high availability behind a load balancer
- Security is layered with WAF, DLP policies, and VNet isolation
- Managed identities remove the need to store credentials in code

<Steps>

1. **Connect to Tallyfy's MCP server**

   Tallyfy provides a hosted MCP server at `https://mcp.tallyfy.com` that exposes 40+ tools for managing tasks, processes, templates, users, and automation. You don't need to build your own MCP server - instead, you'll create a connector that points to Tallyfy's existing server.

   The server uses OAuth 2.1 with PKCE for authentication. Discovery starts at `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` (per RFC 8414), and scopes use dot notation like `mcp.tasks.read`, `mcp.processes.write`, etc.

2. **Create an OpenAPI specification**

   Create a YAML file describing the MCP server for the Power Platform connector:

   ```yaml
   swagger: '2.0'
   info:
     title: Tallyfy MCP Server
     description: MCP server for Tallyfy workflow management
     version: 1.0.0
   host: mcp.tallyfy.com
   basePath: /
   schemes:
     - https
   paths:
     /mcp:
       post:
         summary: Tallyfy Workflow Management Server
         x-ms-agentic-protocol: mcp-streamable-1.0
         operationId: InvokeMCP
         parameters:
           - name: Authorization
             in: header
             required: true
             type: string
             description: Bearer token for authentication
         responses:
           '200':
             description: Success
   securityDefinitions:
     apiKey:
       type: apiKey
       in: header
       name: Authorization
   ```

3. **Create a custom connector in Power Apps**
   
   1. Navigate to your Copilot Studio agent
   2. Go to **Tools** → **Add a tool** → **New tool** → **Custom connector**
   3. In Power Apps, select **New custom connector** → **Import OpenAPI file**
   4. Import your YAML specification and configure authentication

4. **Configure authentication**
   
   In the connector configuration:
   - Set authentication type to **API Key**
   - Configure the header name as `Authorization`
   - Set the prefix to `Bearer `
   - Test the connection with your Tallyfy API key

5. **Add the MCP connector to your agent**
   
   Back in Copilot Studio:
   1. Select **Tools** → **Add a tool** → **Model Context Protocol**
   2. Choose your Tallyfy MCP connector from the list
   3. Authorize the connection with your credentials
   4. Select **Add to agent** or **Add and configure**

6. **Configure DLP policies (optional)**
   
   For enterprise deployments:
   1. Navigate to Power Platform Admin Center
   2. Create DLP policies to control data flow
   3. Apply policies to your Copilot Studio environment
   4. Configure connector classifications (Business/Non-Business/Blocked)

7. **Test the integration**

   In your Copilot Studio agent, try queries like:
   ```
   "Find all open tasks assigned to the sales team"
   "Show me overdue processes for customer onboarding"
   "Create a task for reviewing the Q4 budget"
   ```

</Steps>

## Practical examples

### Multi-agent orchestration

**User prompt:**
```
Start the employee onboarding process for Jane Smith, assign tasks to HR and IT, and schedule training sessions.
```

**What happens:**
1. Primary agent receives the request
2. Delegates to HR agent for documentation tasks via Tallyfy
3. Delegates to IT agent for system access setup
4. Delegates to Training agent for session scheduling
5. Monitors progress across all sub-agents
6. Reports consolidated status back to you

### Power Platform integration

**User prompt:**
```
When a new sales opportunity is created in Dynamics 365, start our proposal process in Tallyfy and create a Teams channel for collaboration.
```

**What happens:**
1. Power Automate flow triggers on Dynamics 365 opportunity
2. MCP server creates Tallyfy process instance
3. Teams connector creates a dedicated channel
4. Agent monitors and reports progress

### Enterprise compliance workflow

**User prompt:**
```
Review all completed audit processes this quarter and generate a compliance report with any violations highlighted.
```

**What happens:**
1. Queries Tallyfy for audit process data
2. Analyzes completion times against SLAs
3. Checks for required approvals
4. Generates formatted report in SharePoint
5. Routes to compliance team if violations are found

- Some features need Power Platform licenses too
- Multi-agent orchestration may still be in preview for some customers

### Regional availability

- MCP available in limited regions initially
- Data residency requirements may restrict usage
- Preview features often US-only at launch

### Connector development overhead

- Must create OpenAPI specifications
- Power Apps/Automate knowledge needed
- Testing takes longer than direct MCP connections
- Versioning and updates require republishing

### Performance considerations

- DLP policy evaluation adds processing time
- VNet routing increases response times (10-50ms typically)
- Large result sets require pagination
- Rate limits are shared across Power Platform

## Ideal use cases

### Enterprise workflow automation

```
"When a purchase order exceeds $50,000 in Dynamics 365, initiate our approval workflow in Tallyfy, notify stakeholders in Teams, and track in Power BI."
```

### Compliance and audit management

```
"Monitor all SOX compliance processes, ensure proper segregation of duties, and generate audit reports with full trail documentation."
```

### Cross-functional process orchestration

```
"Coordinate our product launch process across marketing, sales, and operations teams, with each department's agent handling their specific tasks."
```

### Intelligent process mining

```
"Analyze our customer service processes to identify bottlenecks, suggest optimizations, and automatically implement approved changes."
```

### Regulated industry workflows

```
"Manage our FDA submission process with full audit trails, approval chains, and automatic compliance checking at each step."
```

## Security considerations

1. **Network security** - deploy within VNet for isolation, use Private Endpoints, implement WAF rules, enable DDoS protection
2. **Authentication** - use Azure AD, implement service principal auth for server-to-server, apply conditional access policies, enable MFA
3. **Data protection** - classify data sensitivity levels, apply DLP policies, enable encryption at rest and in transit
4. **Monitoring** - enable Azure Monitor, configure anomaly alerts, maintain audit logs for compliance

## Deployment architectures

### Basic (small organizations)

```
[Copilot Studio] → [Custom Connector] → [Tallyfy MCP Server] → [Tallyfy API]
```

### Enterprise (large organizations)

```
[Copilot Studio]
    ↓ (VNet Integration)
[API Management]
    ↓ (Private Endpoint)
[App Service Environment]
    ├── [MCP Proxy Instance 1]
    ├── [MCP Proxy Instance 2]
    └── [Load Balancer]
         ↓ (Managed Identity)
    [Tallyfy MCP Server]
```

### Hybrid (multi-cloud)

```
[Copilot Studio] → [ExpressRoute] → [On-premises Proxy] → [Tallyfy MCP Server]
                 ↘                                        ↗
                   [Azure Proxy] → [Tallyfy MCP Server]
```

## Best practices

1. **Start with prebuilt connectors** - use Microsoft's MCP connectors as templates
2. **Implement retry logic** - handle transient failures gracefully
3. **Use managed identities** - never store credentials in code
4. **Monitor usage** - track message consumption against limits
5. **Plan for scale** - design for multi-agent scenarios from the start
6. **Test extensively** - use Copilot Studio's testing framework

## Known issues and workarounds

1. **SSE not supported** - use Streamable HTTP for all implementations
2. **Tool naming conflicts** - prefix Tallyfy tools to avoid collisions with other MCP servers
3. **Large payloads** - implement pagination for result sets over 100 items
4. **Session timeout** - implement keep-alive mechanisms for long-running operations
5. **Regional latency** - deploy connectors in same region as Copilot Studio
6. **Resource rendering** - files and images in responses may need extra handling in custom UIs
7. **Admin center visibility** - MCP-enabled agents must be registered to appear in M365 admin center

## Future outlook

- **Continued GA expansion** - more features and regions over time
- **Agent 365 expansion** - unified control plane for AI agents across Microsoft's platform
- **Better debugging tools** - more visibility into MCP interactions
- **Expanded connector marketplace** - more prebuilt enterprise connectors (GitHub, Asana, Jira already available)
- **Zero-trust architecture** - support with full M365 admin governance
- **Performance optimizations** - reduced latency and higher throughput

Microsoft is a founding member of the Agentic AI Foundation, ensuring continued commitment to MCP as an industry standard.

## Summary

Copilot Studio's MCP support takes more setup effort than simpler alternatives, but you get strong security and compliance features, deep Microsoft integration, multi-agent coordination, and enterprise-grade architecture. If you're already using Microsoft tools, it's a natural fit for workflow automation with Tallyfy.
