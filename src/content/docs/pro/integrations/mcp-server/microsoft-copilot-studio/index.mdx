:::note[MCP Client Compatibility]
An MCP server can be used by any MCP client that supports it. Although you can use Tallyfy's MCP server with common AI platforms like OpenAI, Claude or Microsoft Copilot Studio - the UI and ability to do useful work in real life is limited by many factors which are highlighted in this page. Tallyfy is developing its own fully-featured chat UI which will solve all the major problems of using MCP servers with mainstream text-chat AI providers. However, to start using MCP immediately - we recommend adding it to your AI subscription so that you can get the value and benefits immediately. You can additionally use the fully featured Tallyfy-specific AI interface when we launch it.

   ```javascript
   // Example using Node.js on Azure Functions
   const { createMcpServer } = require('@microsoft/mcp-sdk');
   const axios = require('axios');
   
   module.exports = async function (context, req) {
     const server = createMcpServer({
       name: 'Tallyfy MCP Server',
       version: '1.0.0',
       tools: [
         {
           name: 'search_tasks',
           description: 'Search for tasks in Tallyfy',
           parameters: {
             query: { type: 'string', required: true },
             status: { type: 'string', enum: ['open', 'completed', 'overdue'] }
           },
           handler: async (params) => {
             const response = await axios.get('https://api.tallyfy.com/v1/tasks', {
               headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.TALLYFY_API_KEY}` },
               params: { q: params.query, status: params.status }
             });
             return response.data;
           }
         }
       ]
     });
     
     context.res = await server.handleRequest(req);
   };
   ```

2. **Create an OpenAPI specification**
   
   Create a YAML file describing your MCP server for the Power Platform connector:
   
   ```yaml
   swagger: '2.0'
   info:
     title: Tallyfy MCP Server
     description: MCP server for Tallyfy workflow management
     version: 1.0.0
   host: tallyfy-mcp.azurewebsites.net
   basePath: /api
   schemes:
     - https
   paths:
     /mcp:
       post:
         summary: Tallyfy Workflow Management Server
         x-ms-agentic-protocol: mcp-streamable-1.0
         operationId: InvokeMCP
         parameters:
           - name: Authorization
             in: header
             required: true
             type: string
             description: Bearer token for authentication
         responses:
           '200':
             description: Success
   securityDefinitions:
     apiKey:
       type: apiKey
       in: header
       name: Authorization
   ```

3. **Create a custom connector in Power Apps**
