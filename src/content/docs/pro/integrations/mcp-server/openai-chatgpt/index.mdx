title: Using Tallyfy MCP server with ChatGPT
---

import { Steps, CardGrid, LinkTitleCard } from "~/components";

:::note[MCP client compatibility]
Any MCP client that supports the protocol can connect to Tallyfy's MCP server. ChatGPT has full MCP support through "Apps" (formerly "connectors" - renamed December 2025). You get read/write capabilities, though the text-based UI has limitations. Tallyfy is building its own chat UI to address these - but you can start using MCP today.
:::

## What this integration does

ChatGPT Enterprise, Team, and Education users can connect to Tallyfy through its MCP server. You manage workflows using natural language - type what you need and ChatGPT handles the API calls.

This guide covers setup, what works well, and what doesn't.

## ChatGPT MCP support status

- **Availability** - Team, Enterprise, and Education plans support custom MCP server connections via Developer Mode. Plus and Pro only get pre-built connectors.
- **Access method** - Developer Mode and Apps (formerly "connectors")
- **Operations** - Full read/write via Developer Mode, read-only via Deep Research
- **Authentication** - OAuth 2.1 with PKCE (per RFC 8414) via `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`
- **Scopes** - Dot notation like `mcp.tasks.read`, `mcp.processes.write`, `mcp.templates.read`
- **Apps SDK** - Build custom UIs alongside MCP servers

Developer Mode must be enabled in ChatGPT settings to use MCP servers in regular conversations.

## Prerequisites

- ChatGPT Enterprise, Team, or Education subscription
- A Tallyfy account with organization access
- Access to create custom apps in ChatGPT
- Familiarity with OAuth authentication flows

## Setting up Tallyfy MCP server with ChatGPT

<Steps>

1. **Access ChatGPT's apps settings**

   In ChatGPT Enterprise/Team/Education, go to Settings, then Apps. You can also reach this through Deep Research, then Custom Apps.

2. **Create a new MCP app**

   Click "Add Custom App" and enter the MCP server URL:

   ```
   https://mcp.tallyfy.com
   ```

   ChatGPT discovers Tallyfy's OAuth endpoints automatically through the `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` metadata endpoint (RFC 8414).

3. **Authenticate via OAuth 2.1**

   ChatGPT initiates OAuth 2.1 with PKCE using Dynamic Client Registration (RFC 7591). You'll be redirected to Tallyfy's login page to authorize access.

   During authorization, you'll select which organization to connect and approve scopes like `mcp.tasks.read`, `mcp.processes.write`, etc.

   **Security tip** - Consider using an account with only the permissions ChatGPT needs rather than a full admin account.

4. **Set up app instructions**

   Add instructions so ChatGPT knows how to interact with Tallyfy:

   ```
   You are connected to a Tallyfy organization's MCP server. Use this connection to:
   - Search for tasks, processes, and templates
   - Retrieve workflow information
   - Analyze template health and suggest improvements
   - Help users manage their work

   Always confirm destructive actions before executing.
   Format responses clearly with relevant details.
   ```

5. **Test the connection**

   Start a conversation and test with a simple query:
   ```
   "Show me all active processes in Tallyfy"
   ```

6. **Publish to workspace (optional)**

   For team-wide access, publish the app to your ChatGPT workspace. Admins can manage visibility and permissions in workspace settings.

</Steps>

## Practical examples

### Finding overdue tasks

**Prompt:**
```
Using Tallyfy, find all overdue tasks assigned to the marketing team and summarize them by priority.
```

**What happens:**
1. ChatGPT calls `search_for_tasks` with an overdue filter
2. Filters results by marketing team assignment
3. Groups findings by priority
4. Returns a formatted summary

### Analyzing template health

**Prompt:**
```
Analyze our "Customer Onboarding" template in Tallyfy and suggest improvements.
```

**What happens:**
1. Calls `get_template` to pull template details
2. Runs `assess_template_health` for analysis
3. Identifies bottlenecks or redundant steps
4. Suggests specific optimizations

### Creating workflow documentation

**Prompt:**
```
Generate documentation for our "Invoice Processing" workflow, including all steps and form fields.
```

**What happens:**
1. Retrieves template structure using `get_template`
2. Lists all steps with descriptions
3. Documents form fields for each step
4. Includes automation rules

## Limitations of the text-based UI

ChatGPT's text interface hits real walls with certain Tallyfy features:

### Form field interactions

Dropdowns, multi-selects, and complex inputs don't translate well to plain text. A dropdown with 20+ options becomes a wall of text. Date pickers become "type the date in YYYY-MM-DD format." File uploads aren't possible at all.

### Visual workflow representation

ChatGPT can't display Tallyfy's visual process tracker or workflow diagrams. You lose step-by-step flow visualization, real-time progress updates, and dependency mapping.

### Bulk operations

Reassigning 50 tasks means 50 individual commands (or one complex bulk instruction that might fail). Filtering and sorting large process lists produces pages of text. Batch template updates give no visual confirmation.

### Real-time collaboration

ChatGPT's turn-based model doesn't support live updates. Your teammate finishes a task - you won't know until you ask again. Notifications get buried in conversation history. Two people can't work on the same template simultaneously.

## Features that don't work well in ChatGPT

### Visual process tracker

Tallyfy's **Tracker View** shows running processes with progress bars and color-coded statuses. ChatGPT can't render any of it - so monitoring process health at a glance, spotting bottlenecks across workflows, and tracking SLA compliance visually aren't possible.

### Template builder

Creating and editing [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) through ChatGPT is awkward. No drag-and-drop for reordering steps, no visual branching logic, and no preview of the template structure.

### Advanced filtering and views

Tallyfy's filtering doesn't translate to text. You can't save custom views, multi-dimensional filtering requires complex natural language, and there are no visual indicators for results.

### Analytics

No charts, graphs, or trend visualizations. For visual analytics, connect your BI tools to [Tallyfy Analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/) instead.

## Where ChatGPT shines with Tallyfy MCP

### Natural language search

```
"Find all templates related to employee onboarding that include background check steps"
```

ChatGPT searches template names, descriptions, and step content - finding what you need in seconds.

### Form field generation

```
"Add appropriate form fields to collect customer feedback in our support process"
```

ChatGPT examines your process context and suggests fields with appropriate validation rules.

### What-if automation scenarios

```
"If I set up an automation to assign tasks based on deal value, show me how it would route these 5 example deals"
```

ChatGPT runs the simulation without touching your live processes.

### Process documentation updates

```
"Here's our updated SOX compliance procedure. Update our audit template to match these new requirements, highlighting what changed"
```

ChatGPT reads your document, identifies changes, and updates your template accordingly.

### Template optimization from task patterns

```
"Analyze one-off tasks added to our hiring processes last month and suggest which should be added to the template"
```

ChatGPT spots patterns and suggests which ad-hoc tasks deserve a permanent place in your template.

### Complex query answering

```
"Which step in our sales process has the longest average completion time, and which team members are fastest at completing it?"
```

ChatGPT analyzes your data and returns the answer with links to the specific [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) it examined.

## Security considerations

1. **Access control** - Use accounts with minimal required permissions. Consider a dedicated service account for the ChatGPT integration.

2. **Data sensitivity** - Review which templates and processes contain sensitive information. Audit data access logs regularly.

3. **Prompt injection** - Be cautious of templates or data containing prompt-like text. Verify unexpected ChatGPT behaviors and report suspicious activity to both OpenAI and Tallyfy support.

## Known issues

1. **Deep Research is read-only** - Enable Developer Mode in ChatGPT Settings for write operations
2. **Session timeouts** - Long-running queries may timeout after 60 seconds
3. **Context window limits** - Large template structures may exceed token limits
4. **No real-time updates** - Changes in Tallyfy aren't reflected until the next query
5. **Limited file handling** - Can't process attachments or generate files
6. **No webhook support** - Can't trigger or respond to Tallyfy webhooks
7. **Terminology** - OpenAI renamed "connectors" to "apps" in December 2025, so some docs may use the old term

## Best practices

1. **Be specific** - Instead of "show me tasks," try "show me high-priority tasks assigned to John due this week"
2. **Batch requests** - Combine related queries in a single prompt
3. **Ask for analysis** - Request insights and patterns, not just raw data
4. **Save effective prompts** - Reuse prompts that work well for common workflows
5. **Combine with Tallyfy's UI** - Use ChatGPT for analysis and planning, then execute in Tallyfy's visual interface

## What's next

- **Write capabilities** - Already available via Developer Mode
- **OAuth 2.1** - Live now with PKCE and Dynamic Client Registration
- **Apps SDK** - Build custom UIs alongside MCP servers
- **Real-time sync** - Live updates between ChatGPT and Tallyfy (coming soon)

OpenAI and Tallyfy are both expanding MCP features. MCP is governed by the Agentic AI Foundation under the Linux Foundation.
