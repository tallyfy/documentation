:::note[MCP Client Compatibility]
An MCP server can be used by any MCP client that supports it. Although you can use Tallyfy's MCP server with common AI platforms like OpenAI, Claude or Microsoft Copilot Studio - the UI and ability to do useful work in real life is limited by many factors which are highlighted in this page. Tallyfy is developing its own fully-featured chat UI which will solve all the major problems of using MCP servers with mainstream text-chat AI providers. However, to start using MCP immediately - we recommend adding it to your AI subscription so that you can get the value and benefits immediately. You can additionally use the fully featured Tallyfy-specific AI interface when we launch it.

## Limitations of text-based UI

While ChatGPT's MCP integration is powerful, the text-based interface presents several limitations when working with Tallyfy:

### 1. Form field interactions

**Challenge**: Dropdown fields, multi-select options, and complex form inputs are difficult to represent in plain text.

**Example limitation:**
- When a task has a dropdown with 20+ options, ChatGPT displays all options as plain text, making selection cumbersome
- Date pickers and time selections require manual text entry instead of visual selection
- File upload fields cannot be properly utilized through text interface

### 2. Visual workflow representation

**Challenge**: ChatGPT cannot display Tallyfy's visual process tracker or workflow diagrams.

**Impact:**
- Users cannot see the visual flow of steps in a template
- Real-time process progress visualization is lost
- Dependency relationships between steps are hard to understand in text format

### 3. Bulk operations

**Challenge**: Managing multiple items simultaneously is inefficient in a conversational interface.

**Example scenarios:**
- Reassigning 50 tasks requires individual commands or complex bulk instructions
- Filtering and sorting large lists of processes becomes tedious
- Batch updates to templates lack visual confirmation

### 4. Real-time collaboration

**Challenge**: ChatGPT's turn-based interaction model doesn't support real-time updates.

**Limitations:**
- Cannot see live updates when team members complete tasks
- No real-time notifications for urgent items
- Collaborative template editing is sequential, not simultaneous

## Major blockers for full Tallyfy functionality

Several Tallyfy features are significantly hampered or unusable through ChatGPT's text interface:

### 1. Visual process tracker

The **Tracker View** in Tallyfy provides a bird's-eye view of all running processes with visual progress indicators. This critical feature is completely absent in ChatGPT, making it difficult to:
- Monitor overall process health at a glance
- Identify bottlenecks across multiple workflows
- Track SLA compliance visually
- See process completion percentages

### 2. Template builder interface

Creating and editing [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) through ChatGPT is extremely limited:
- Cannot drag-and-drop to reorder steps
- Difficult to visualize branching logic
- Complex automation rules are hard to configure through text
- No visual preview of the template structure

### 3. Advanced filtering and views

Tallyfy's powerful filtering capabilities in the Tasks and Tracker views are reduced to text-based queries:
- Cannot save custom views
- Multi-dimensional filtering requires complex natural language queries
- No visual indicators for filter results
- Sorting options are limited and cumbersome

### 4. Interactive dashboards

Analytics and reporting dashboards cannot be effectively represented:
- No charts or graphs visualization
- Trend analysis requires textual descriptions
- Performance metrics lack visual context
- Export functionality is limited

## Ideal use cases for ChatGPT + Tallyfy MCP

Despite limitations, ChatGPT excels at specific Tallyfy workflows:

### 1. Natural language template search

**Strength**: Finding relevant templates using conversational queries.

**Example**:
```
"Find all templates related to employee onboarding that include background check steps"
```

ChatGPT can search across template names, descriptions, and step content to find matches.

### 2. Automated field generation

**Strength**: Creating form fields based on process descriptions.

**Example**:
```
"Add appropriate form fields to collect customer feedback in our support process"
```

ChatGPT can analyze the context and suggest relevant fields with proper validation rules.

### 3. What-if automation scenarios

**Strength**: Testing automation logic before implementation.

**Example**:
```
"If I set up an automation to assign tasks based on deal value, show me how it would route these 5 example deals"
```

ChatGPT can simulate automation outcomes without affecting live processes.

### 4. Process documentation updates

**Strength**: Updating templates based on document changes.

**Example**:
```
"Here's our updated SOX compliance procedure. Update our audit template to match these new requirements, highlighting what changed"
```

ChatGPT can intelligently map document changes to template modifications.

### 5. Template optimization from task patterns

**Strength**: Identifying recurring ad-hoc tasks that should be formalized.

**Example**:
```
"Analyze one-off tasks added to our hiring processes last month and suggest which should be added to the template"
```

ChatGPT can identify patterns and propose template improvements with user moderation.

### 6. Complex query answering

**Strength**: Answering specific questions about workflow data with citations.

**Example**:
```
"Which step in our sales process has the longest average completion time, and which team members are fastest at completing it?"
```

ChatGPT can analyze data and provide detailed insights with references to specific [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).

## Security considerations

When connecting ChatGPT to Tallyfy:

1. **API key management**
   - Use dedicated service accounts with minimal required permissions
   - Rotate API keys regularly
   - Monitor API usage for anomalies

2. **Data sensitivity**
   - Review which templates and processes contain sensitive information
   - Consider creating ChatGPT-specific user roles with restricted access
   - Audit data access logs regularly

3. **Prompt injection risks**
   - Be cautious of templates or data that might contain prompt-like text
   - Verify unexpected ChatGPT behaviors
   - Report suspicious activity to both OpenAI and Tallyfy support

## Known issues and limitations (January 2025)

Current known issues with ChatGPT's MCP implementation:

1. **Read-only operations**: Cannot create or modify data directly through MCP
2. **Session timeouts**: Long-running queries may timeout after 60 seconds
3. **Context window limits**: Large template structures may exceed token limits
4. **No real-time updates**: Changes made in Tallyfy aren't reflected until next query
5. **Limited file handling**: Cannot process attachments or generate files
6. **No webhook support**: Cannot trigger or respond to Tallyfy webhooks

## Best practices

To maximize the effectiveness of ChatGPT with Tallyfy:

1. **Use specific queries**: Instead of "show me tasks," use "show me high-priority tasks assigned to John due this week"

2. **Batch related requests**: Combine multiple related queries in a single prompt for efficiency

3. **Leverage ChatGPT's analysis**: Ask for insights and patterns, not just data retrieval

4. **Create query templates**: Save effective prompts for common workflows

5. **Combine with native Tallyfy**: Use ChatGPT for analysis and planning, then execute in Tallyfy's visual interface

## Future outlook

As MCP technology evolves, we anticipate:

- **Write capabilities**: Creating and modifying workflows through ChatGPT
- **Richer UI elements**: Better representation of visual elements in text
- **Real-time synchronization**: Live updates between ChatGPT and Tallyfy
