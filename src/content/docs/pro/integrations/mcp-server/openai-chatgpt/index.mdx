title: Using Tallyfy MCP server with ChatGPT
---

import { Steps, CardGrid, LinkTitleCard } from "~/components";

:::note[MCP Client Compatibility]
An MCP server can be used by any MCP client that supports it. ChatGPT now has full MCP support through "Apps" (formerly called "connectors" - renamed December 2025). You can use Tallyfy's MCP server with read/write capabilities, though the text-based UI has limitations. We'll show you what works and what doesn't. Tallyfy is building its own chat UI to fix these limitations - but start using MCP today for immediate value.
:::

## Overview

ChatGPT Enterprise, Team, and Education users can connect to Tallyfy through MCP servers. It's a game-changer. You can manage your workflows using natural language - just type what you need and ChatGPT handles the technical details.

This guide shows you exactly how to set up the integration, what it can (and can't) do, and whether it's right for your team.

## ChatGPT MCP support status

ChatGPT's MCP implementation includes:

- **Availability**: ChatGPT Team, Enterprise, and Education plans for custom MCP server connections (Developer Mode); Plus and Pro have access to pre-built connectors only
- **Access method**: Through Developer Mode and Apps (formerly "connectors" - renamed December 2025)
- **Supported operations**: Full read/write via Developer Mode (Team/Enterprise/Edu), read-only via Deep Research
- **Authentication**: API key-based or OAuth 2.1 authentication
- **Security**: User-managed MCP server connections with security warnings
- **Apps SDK**: Build custom UIs alongside MCP servers for enhanced experiences

**Note:** Developer Mode must be enabled in ChatGPT settings to use MCP servers in regular conversations. Apps can be created using OpenAI's Apps SDK for custom frontends.

## Prerequisites

You'll need these before we start:

- ChatGPT Enterprise, Team, or Education subscription
- Tallyfy API key (available from your Tallyfy organization settings)
- Access to create custom Deep Research connectors in ChatGPT
- Basic understanding of API security best practices

## Setting up Tallyfy MCP Server with ChatGPT

<Steps>

1. **Obtain your Tallyfy API key**
   
   Navigate to your Tallyfy organization settings and generate an API key. Store this securely as it provides full access to your Tallyfy data.

2. **Access ChatGPT's Apps settings**

   In ChatGPT Enterprise/Team/Education, navigate to Settings → Apps (formerly called "connectors"). You can also access via Deep Research → Custom Apps.

3. **Create a new MCP app**

   Click "Add Custom App" and provide the following configuration:
   
   ```json
   {
     "name": "Tallyfy Workflow Assistant",
     "description": "Access and manage Tallyfy workflows via natural language",
     "mcp_server_url": "https://mcp.tallyfy.com",
     "authentication": {
       "type": "api_key",
       "header_name": "Authorization",
       "key_prefix": "Bearer "
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Configure authentication**

   When prompted, enter your Tallyfy API key or use OAuth 2.1 authentication (recommended for enhanced security). ChatGPT will securely store credentials for future connections.

   **Security warning**: Only use API keys from accounts with appropriate permissions. Consider creating a dedicated service account with limited access for ChatGPT integration. OAuth 2.1 with PKCE is the most secure option.

5. **Set up app instructions**

   Provide detailed instructions for ChatGPT to understand how to interact with Tallyfy:
   
   ```
   You are connected to a Tallyfy organization's MCP server. Use this connection to:
   - Search for tasks, processes, and templates
   - Retrieve workflow information
   - Analyze template health and suggest improvements
   - Help users manage their work
   
   Always confirm destructive actions before executing.
   Format responses clearly with relevant details.
   ```

6. **Test the connection**
   
   Start a new Deep Research session and test with a simple query:
   ```
   "Show me all active processes in Tallyfy"
   ```
   
   ChatGPT should connect to the MCP server and retrieve your process data.

7. **Publish to workspace (optional)**

   For team-wide access, publish the app to your ChatGPT workspace, allowing all team members to use the Tallyfy integration. Admins can manage app visibility and permissions in workspace settings.

</Steps>

## Practical demonstrations

### Example 1: Finding overdue tasks

**User prompt:**
```
Using Tallyfy, find all overdue tasks assigned to the marketing team and summarize them by priority.
```

**ChatGPT with MCP will:**
1. Connect to Tallyfy MCP server
2. Execute `search_for_tasks` with overdue filter
3. Filter results by marketing team assignment
4. Organize findings by priority
5. Present a formatted summary

### Example 2: Analyzing template health

**User prompt:**
```
Analyze our "Customer Onboarding" template in Tallyfy and suggest improvements for efficiency.
```

**ChatGPT with MCP will:**
1. Use `get_template` to retrieve template details
2. Execute `assess_template_health` for thorough analysis
3. Identify bottlenecks or redundant steps
4. Suggest specific optimizations
5. Provide actionable recommendations

### Example 3: Creating workflow documentation

**User prompt:**
```
Generate documentation for our "Invoice Processing" workflow in Tallyfy, including all steps and form fields.
```

**ChatGPT with MCP will:**
1. Retrieve template structure using `get_template`
2. List all steps with descriptions
3. Document form fields for each step
4. Include automation rules
5. Format as readable documentation

## Limitations of text-based UI

Here's the thing - ChatGPT's text interface hits some real walls with Tallyfy:

### 1. Form field interactions

**Challenge**: Dropdown fields, multi-select options, and complex form inputs are difficult to represent in plain text.

**Example limitation:**
- Got a dropdown with 20+ options? ChatGPT shows them all as a wall of text. Good luck picking the right one.
- Date pickers become "please type the date in YYYY-MM-DD format" - not exactly user-friendly
- File uploads? Forget about it. The text interface can't handle them.

### 2. Visual workflow representation

**Challenge**: ChatGPT cannot display Tallyfy's visual process tracker or workflow diagrams.

**Impact:**
- Can't see how steps flow from one to another
- Real-time progress updates? Gone.
- Dependencies between steps become a guessing game

### 3. Bulk operations

**Challenge**: Managing multiple items simultaneously is inefficient in a conversational interface.

**Example scenarios:**
- Need to reassign 50 tasks? You're looking at typing 50 individual commands (or one really complex bulk instruction that might break)
- Want to filter and sort a big list of processes? Hope you like reading through pages of text
- Batch template updates happen in the dark - no visual confirmation until you check manually

### 4. Real-time collaboration

**Challenge**: ChatGPT's turn-based interaction model doesn't support real-time updates.

**Limitations:**
- Your teammate just finished a task? You won't know until you ask again
- Urgent notifications get buried in conversation history
- Two people editing the same template means taking turns - no simultaneous work

## Major blockers for full Tallyfy functionality

Let's be honest - some Tallyfy features just don't work well in ChatGPT:

### 1. Visual process tracker

The **Tracker View** in Tallyfy gives you that bird's-eye view of all running processes - visual progress bars, color-coded statuses, the works. ChatGPT? Can't show you any of it. That makes it tough to:
- Monitor overall process health at a glance
- Identify bottlenecks across multiple workflows
- Track SLA compliance visually
- See process completion percentages

### 2. Template builder interface

Creating and editing [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) through ChatGPT? It's painful:
- Cannot drag-and-drop to reorder steps
- Difficult to visualize branching logic
- Complex automation rules are hard to configure through text
- No visual preview of the template structure

### 3. Advanced filtering and views

Tallyfy's powerful filtering just doesn't translate to text:
- Cannot save custom views
- Multi-dimensional filtering requires complex natural language queries
- No visual indicators for filter results
- Sorting options are limited and cumbersome

### 4. Interactive analytics visualization

Visual analytics in text-based chat? Not happening:
- No charts or graphs visualization
- Trend analysis requires textual descriptions
- Performance metrics lack visual context
- For visual analytics, connect your BI tools to [Tallyfy Analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/) instead

## Ideal use cases for ChatGPT + Tallyfy MCP

Where does ChatGPT actually shine with Tallyfy? Here are the sweet spots:

### 1. Natural language template search

**Strength**: Finding relevant templates using conversational queries.

**Example**:
```
"Find all templates related to employee onboarding that include background check steps"
```

ChatGPT searches template names, descriptions, and even the content inside steps. It finds what you're looking for in seconds.

### 2. Automated field generation

**Strength**: Creating form fields based on process descriptions.

**Example**:
```
"Add appropriate form fields to collect customer feedback in our support process"
```

ChatGPT looks at your process context and suggests fields that actually make sense - complete with the right validation rules.

### 3. What-if automation scenarios

**Strength**: Testing automation logic before implementation.

**Example**:
```
"If I set up an automation to assign tasks based on deal value, show me how it would route these 5 example deals"
```

ChatGPT runs the simulation without touching your live processes. Safe testing.

### 4. Process documentation updates

**Strength**: Updating templates based on document changes.

**Example**:
```
"Here's our updated SOX compliance procedure. Update our audit template to match these new requirements, highlighting what changed"
```

ChatGPT reads your document, figures out what changed, and updates your template accordingly. Pretty slick.

### 5. Template optimization from task patterns

**Strength**: Identifying recurring ad-hoc tasks that should be formalized.

**Example**:
```
"Analyze one-off tasks added to our hiring processes last month and suggest which should be added to the template"
```

ChatGPT spots the patterns and suggests which tasks deserve a permanent home in your template. You decide what makes the cut.

### 6. Complex query answering

**Strength**: Answering specific questions about workflow data with citations.

**Example**:
```
"Which step in our sales process has the longest average completion time, and which team members are fastest at completing it?"
```

ChatGPT digs through your data, crunches the numbers, and gives you the answer - complete with links to the specific [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) it analyzed.

## Security considerations

When connecting ChatGPT to Tallyfy:

1. **API key management**
   - Use dedicated service accounts with minimal required permissions
   - Rotate API keys regularly
   - Monitor API usage for anomalies

2. **Data sensitivity**
   - Review which templates and processes contain sensitive information
   - Consider creating ChatGPT-specific user roles with restricted access
   - Audit data access logs regularly

3. **Prompt injection risks**
   - Be cautious of templates or data that might contain prompt-like text
   - Verify unexpected ChatGPT behaviors
   - Report suspicious activity to both OpenAI and Tallyfy support

## Known issues and limitations

Current limitations to be aware of:

1. **Deep Research is read-only**: Use Developer Mode for write operations - enable it in ChatGPT Settings → Beta Features → Developer Mode
2. **Apps SDK available**: For custom UIs alongside MCP servers, explore OpenAI's Apps SDK at developers.openai.com/apps-sdk
3. **Session timeouts**: Long-running queries may timeout after 60 seconds
4. **Context window limits**: Large template structures may exceed token limits
5. **No real-time updates**: Changes made in Tallyfy aren't reflected until next query
6. **Limited file handling**: Cannot process attachments or generate files
7. **No webhook support**: Cannot trigger or respond to Tallyfy webhooks
8. **Terminology note**: OpenAI renamed "connectors" to "apps" in December 2025 - some documentation may still reference the old terminology

## Best practices

Want to get the most out of ChatGPT with Tallyfy? Follow these tips:

1. **Use specific queries**: Instead of "show me tasks," use "show me high-priority tasks assigned to John due this week"

2. **Batch related requests**: Combine multiple related queries in a single prompt for efficiency

3. **Use ChatGPT's analysis**: Ask for insights and patterns, not just data retrieval

4. **Create query templates**: Save effective prompts for common workflows

5. **Combine with native Tallyfy**: Use ChatGPT for analysis and planning, then execute in Tallyfy's visual interface

## Future outlook

What's available now and coming next:

- **Write capabilities**: Already available via Developer Mode - create and modify workflows through ChatGPT
- **Apps SDK**: Build custom UIs alongside MCP servers for richer experiences
- **OAuth 2.1 support**: Enhanced security with PKCE authentication flow
