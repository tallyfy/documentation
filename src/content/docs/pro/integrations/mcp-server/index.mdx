## Tallyfy MCP Server (Preview)

:::warning[Feature in Development]
The Tallyfy MCP Server is currently in development and **subject to change**. The features and capabilities described here represent the current state of development and may evolve before the official release.
:::

:::note[MCP Client Compatibility]
An MCP server can be used by any MCP client that supports it. You can connect Tallyfy's MCP server with OpenAI, Claude or Microsoft Copilot Studio right now - but honestly, the text-based UI has serious limitations (we'll explain those below). We're building our own chat interface that fixes these problems. Still, you should add MCP to your AI subscription today. You'll get immediate value, and when our custom interface launches, you'll have the best of both worlds.
:::

Tallyfy's MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server lets you control your workflows with plain English through any AI platform that supports MCP. You describe what you want. The AI handles the rest - no API endpoints or complex interfaces required.

### What is MCP?

Think of MCP as a universal translator between AI assistants and your business tools. It's an open standard that creates secure connections, letting AI models talk to external systems while you stay in control of security and permissions.

### How Tallyfy MCP Server works

The Tallyfy MCP Server connects AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, and others) directly to your Tallyfy organization. Give it your API token. That's it. Now you can:

- Ask questions about your [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) and [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in natural language
- Create and manage tasks through conversation
- Analyze [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) and get suggestions for improvements
- Search across your organization's workflows
- Manage [users](/products/pro/documenting/members/) and [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/)

**Example interactions:**
- "Show me all overdue tasks for John"
- "Create a task for reviewing the quarterly budget, due next Friday"
- "What templates do we have for customer onboarding?"
- "Analyze the health of our 'Employee Onboarding' template"

- Every action respects your existing permissions
- Audit trails show exactly who did what
- Your data stays protected by Tallyfy's [security](/products/pro/compliance/) protocols

### Getting started (When available)

Once the MCP Server is officially released, you'll be able to:

1. **Set up the connection** using your Tallyfy API credentials
2. **Configure your AI assistant** to connect to the Tallyfy MCP Server
3. **Start conversing** with your Tallyfy data using natural language
4. **Perform complex workflows** through simple descriptions

- **Tool Framework** - Structured definitions so AI knows what it can do
- **Authentication Layer** - Token-based security (your data stays safe)
- **Natural Language Processing** - Turns your questions into API calls

## Major limitations of text-based AI interfaces

Here's the thing - MCP is powerful, but text-based AI chat has some frustrating limitations when you're trying to use Tallyfy's visual workflow features:

### Visual interface constraints

You can't see what you're doing. That's the problem.

- **No visual process tracker**: Cannot display Tallyfy's bird's-eye view of running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) with visual progress indicators
- **Missing template builder**: Cannot show the drag-and-drop template interface or visualize step dependencies and branching logic
- **Lack of aggregated views**: Cannot present easily filterable views to see processes and tasks at a glance
- **No real-time progress**: Cannot show live updates as team members complete tasks or processes advance

### Form field interaction challenges

Remember those nice dropdown menus and date pickers in Tallyfy? In text chat, they turn into a mess:

- **Dropdown fields**: When a task has dropdown boxes with multiple options, text-based AI must list all options as plain text, making selection tedious
- **Multi-select inputs**: Complex form inputs lose their intuitive interface when reduced to text commands
- **Date/time pickers**: Visual calendar and time selection tools must be replaced with manual text entry
- **File uploads**: Cannot properly handle file upload fields through conversational interface

### Assignment and collaboration barriers

Assigning work to your team? It gets clunky fast:

- **Assignee selection**: Cannot easily pick assignees as Tallyfy's UI suggests [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/), [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/), job titles, and groups with visual indicators
- **Bulk operations**: Managing multiple assignments or reassigning many tasks becomes inefficient through individual text commands
- **Team collaboration**: Real-time collaborative features like simultaneous template editing are reduced to sequential interactions

### Template creation limitations

Want to build a template? Text chat makes it painful:

- **Step visualization**: Cannot see all steps in a template at once or understand their relationships
- **Reordering steps**: No drag-and-drop capability; must use complex text commands
- **Automation configuration**: Complex [automation rules](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) are difficult to set up through conversational interfaces
- **Preview functionality**: Cannot visually preview how the template will function before deployment

## Ideal use cases for MCP with text-based AI

Don't get us wrong - there are times when text-based MCP absolutely shines. Let's talk about those.

### Natural language search and discovery

This is where MCP really works. Ask complex questions, get specific answers:

- **Template search**: "Find all templates related to employee onboarding that include background check steps"
- **Process discovery**: "Show me all customer onboarding processes that took longer than 5 days to complete"
- **Task queries**: "Which tasks are overdue and assigned to the sales team?"
- **Cross-reference search**: "Find templates that use the 'Budget Approval' form field"

### Intelligent template generation

Got a messy document? AI turns it into clean, structured templates in minutes:

- **Auto-creating form fields**: Upload existing forms or documents and let AI automatically generate appropriate [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) with validation rules
- **Flowchart conversion**: Study flowcharts or process diagrams to automatically create [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) with proper step sequences
- **Automation generation**: Analyze business rules in plain language and convert them to [automation rules](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/)
- **Bulk field creation**: Generate multiple related form fields based on document analysis

### What-if scenario testing

Want to test changes before making them? MCP lets you run simulations:

- **Automation testing**: "If I set up an automation to assign tasks based on deal value, show me how it would route these 5 example deals"
- **Process optimization**: "What would happen if we removed the approval step for purchases under $1,000?"
- **Workload analysis**: "Show me how task distribution would change if we reassigned all of John's templates to Sarah"
- **Time estimation**: "Based on historical data, estimate completion time if we add a review step"

### Intelligent process updates

Your compliance docs changed? AI spots the differences and updates everything in one go:

- **Document-based updates**: "Here's our updated SOX compliance procedure. Update our audit template to match these new requirements"
- **Change highlighting**: AI can identify exactly what changed and update only the affected parts
- **Version comparison**: Compare old and new process documents to generate precise template modifications
- **Bulk updates**: Apply consistent changes across multiple templates based on policy updates

### Pattern recognition and optimization

MCP watches how your team actually works - then suggests smart improvements:

- **Ad-hoc task analysis**: "Look at one-off tasks added to hiring processes last month and suggest which should be added to the template"
- **Bottleneck identification**: "Analyze which steps consistently cause delays and suggest optimizations"
- **Template consolidation**: "Find similar templates that could be merged into a single, more flexible template"
- **Best practice extraction**: "Identify common patterns in high-performing processes and suggest template improvements"

### Complex reporting with citations

Need hard data? AI digs deep and shows you exactly where to look:

- **Performance queries**: "Which step in our sales process has the longest average completion time, and which team members are fastest?"
- **Compliance reporting**: "Show all instances where required approvals were skipped, with links to specific processes"
- **Trend analysis**: "How has our customer onboarding time changed over the last 6 months, and what factors contributed?"
- **Cross-functional insights**: "Which departments most frequently add ad-hoc tasks, and what types of tasks are they?"

We'll let you know the moment this feature goes live. Setup guides are coming too.
