## Tallyfy MCP Server (Preview)

:::warning[Feature in Development]
The Tallyfy MCP Server is currently in development and **subject to change**. The features and capabilities described here represent the current state of development and may evolve before the official release.
:::

:::note[MCP Client Compatibility]
An MCP server can be used by any MCP client that supports it. Although you can use Tallyfy's MCP server with common AI platforms like OpenAI, Claude or Microsoft Copilot Studio - the UI and ability to do useful work in real life is limited by many factors which are highlighted in this page. Tallyfy is developing its own fully-featured chat UI which will solve all the major problems of using MCP servers with mainstream text-chat AI providers. However, to start using MCP immediately - we recommend adding it to your AI subscription so that you can get the value and benefits immediately. You can additionally use the fully featured Tallyfy-specific AI interface when we launch it.
:::

Tallyfy's MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server enables you to interact with your Tallyfy workflows using natural language through any AI platform that supports MCP. Instead of learning specific API endpoints or using web interfaces, you can simply describe what you want to accomplish, and the AI will execute the appropriate Tallyfy actions on your behalf.

### What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that allows AI assistants to securely connect to external systems and data sources. It provides a standardized way for AI models to access and interact with tools and resources while maintaining security and control.

### How Tallyfy MCP Server works

The Tallyfy MCP Server acts as a bridge between AI assistants (like Claude, ChatGPT, or others that support MCP) and your Tallyfy organization. You provide your Tallyfy API token to authenticate the connection, and then you can:

- Ask questions about your [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) and [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in natural language
- Create and manage tasks through conversation
- Analyze [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) and get suggestions for improvements
- Search across your organization's workflows
- Manage [users](/products/pro/documenting/members/) and [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/)

**Example interactions:**
- "Show me all overdue tasks for John"
- "Create a task for reviewing the quarterly budget, due next Friday"
- "What templates do we have for customer onboarding?"
- "Analyze the health of our 'Employee Onboarding' template"

## Major limitations of text-based AI interfaces

While MCP enables powerful capabilities, traditional text-based AI chat interfaces present significant limitations when working with Tallyfy's rich workflow features:

### Visual interface constraints

Text-based AI chat cannot effectively represent Tallyfy's visual elements:

- **No visual process tracker**: Cannot display Tallyfy's bird's-eye view of running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) with visual progress indicators
- **Missing template builder**: Cannot show the drag-and-drop template interface or visualize step dependencies and branching logic
- **Lack of aggregated views**: Cannot present easily filterable views to see processes and tasks at a glance
- **No real-time progress**: Cannot show live updates as team members complete tasks or processes advance

### Form field interaction challenges

Tallyfy's rich [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) become cumbersome in plain text:

- **Dropdown fields**: When a task has dropdown boxes with multiple options, text-based AI must list all options as plain text, making selection tedious
- **Multi-select inputs**: Complex form inputs lose their intuitive interface when reduced to text commands
- **Date/time pickers**: Visual calendar and time selection tools must be replaced with manual text entry
- **File uploads**: Cannot properly handle file upload fields through conversational interface

### Assignment and collaboration barriers

Tallyfy's sophisticated assignment features don't translate well to text:

- **Assignee selection**: Cannot easily pick assignees as Tallyfy's UI suggests [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/), [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/), job titles, and groups with visual indicators
- **Bulk operations**: Managing multiple assignments or reassigning many tasks becomes inefficient through individual text commands
- **Team collaboration**: Real-time collaborative features like simultaneous template editing are reduced to sequential interactions

### Template creation limitations

Building and editing [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) through text chat is extremely limited:

- **Step visualization**: Cannot see all steps in a template at once or understand their relationships
- **Reordering steps**: No drag-and-drop capability; must use complex text commands
- **Automation configuration**: Complex [automation rules](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) are difficult to set up through conversational interfaces
- **Preview functionality**: Cannot visually preview how the template will function before deployment

## Ideal use cases for MCP with text-based AI

Despite limitations, MCP excels at specific workflows where text-based interaction is actually advantageous:

### Natural language search and discovery

MCP shines when finding information using conversational queries:

- **Template search**: "Find all templates related to employee onboarding that include background check steps"
- **Process discovery**: "Show me all customer onboarding processes that took longer than 5 days to complete"
- **Task queries**: "Which tasks are overdue and assigned to the sales team?"
- **Cross-reference search**: "Find templates that use the 'Budget Approval' form field"

### Intelligent template generation

AI excels at creating structured content from unstructured inputs:

- **Auto-creating form fields**: Upload existing forms or documents and let AI automatically generate appropriate [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) with validation rules
- **Flowchart conversion**: Study flowcharts or process diagrams to automatically create [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) with proper step sequences
- **Automation generation**: Analyze business rules in plain language and convert them to [automation rules](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/)
- **Bulk field creation**: Generate multiple related form fields based on document analysis

### What-if scenario testing

MCP enables powerful simulation capabilities:

- **Automation testing**: "If I set up an automation to assign tasks based on deal value, show me how it would route these 5 example deals"
- **Process optimization**: "What would happen if we removed the approval step for purchases under $1,000?"
- **Workload analysis**: "Show me how task distribution would change if we reassigned all of John's templates to Sarah"
- **Time estimation**: "Based on historical data, estimate completion time if we add a review step"

### Intelligent process updates

AI excels at understanding changes and applying them systematically:

- **Document-based updates**: "Here's our updated SOX compliance procedure. Update our audit template to match these new requirements"
- **Change highlighting**: AI can identify exactly what changed and update only the affected parts
- **Version comparison**: Compare old and new process documents to generate precise template modifications
- **Bulk updates**: Apply consistent changes across multiple templates based on policy updates

### Pattern recognition and optimization

MCP can identify improvement opportunities from actual usage:

- **Ad-hoc task analysis**: "Look at one-off tasks added to hiring processes last month and suggest which should be added to the template"
- **Bottleneck identification**: "Analyze which steps consistently cause delays and suggest optimizations"
- **Template consolidation**: "Find similar templates that could be merged into a single, more flexible template"
- **Best practice extraction**: "Identify common patterns in high-performing processes and suggest template improvements"

### Complex reporting with citations

AI provides detailed analysis with direct references:

- **Performance queries**: "Which step in our sales process has the longest average completion time, and which team members are fastest?"
- **Compliance reporting**: "Show all instances where required approvals were skipped, with links to specific processes"
- **Trend analysis**: "How has our customer onboarding time changed over the last 6 months, and what factors contributed?"
- **Cross-functional insights**: "Which departments most frequently add ad-hoc tasks, and what types of tasks are they?"

Stay tuned for official release announcements and detailed setup instructions as this feature moves from development to production.
