## Tallyfy MCP server (preview)

:::warning[Feature in development]
The Tallyfy MCP Server is in active development and **subject to change**. Capabilities described here reflect the current state and may evolve before official release.
:::

:::note[MCP client compatibility]
MCP is the industry standard for connecting AI to external tools. In December 2025, Anthropic donated MCP to the Agentic AI Foundation under the Linux Foundation - co-founded by Anthropic, Block, and OpenAI, with AWS, Google, Microsoft, Cloudflare, and Bloomberg as supporting members. You can connect Tallyfy's MCP server with **OpenAI ChatGPT**, **Claude**, **Google Gemini**, **Microsoft Copilot Studio**, and **Slack**. The text-based UI has limitations (explained below), but we're building our own chat interface that fixes these.
:::

Tallyfy's MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server lets you control workflows with plain English through any AI platform that supports MCP. You describe what you want, and the AI handles the rest - no API knowledge required. For a simpler approach that uses your existing AI subscriptions without technical setup, see our [BYO AI (Bring Your Own AI)](/products/pro/integrations/byo-ai/) integration.

### What is MCP?

MCP is a universal translator between AI assistants and your business tools. It's an open standard - governed by the Agentic AI Foundation under the Linux Foundation - that creates secure connections between AI models and external systems while you stay in control of permissions. All major AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft) support it.

### How it works

The MCP Server connects AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, and others) directly to your Tallyfy organization. Connect with OAuth 2.1 authentication or an API token, and you can:

- Ask questions about your [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) and [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in plain English
- Create, complete, and manage tasks through conversation
- Launch and manage [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) directly
- Analyze [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) and get improvement suggestions
- Search across your organization's workflows
- Manage [users](/products/pro/documenting/members/) and [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/)

**Example interactions:**
- "Show me all overdue tasks for John"
- "Launch the Employee Onboarding process for Jane Doe"
- "What templates do we have for customer onboarding?"
- "Analyze the health of our 'Employee Onboarding' template"

### Security and authentication

The MCP Server uses OAuth 2.1 with PKCE for secure authentication. The well-known endpoint at `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` (per RFC 8414) lets AI clients discover authorization endpoints automatically. OAuth scopes use dot notation - for example, `mcp.tasks.read`, `mcp.processes.write`, `mcp.templates.read`.

Key security features:

- Only authorized users can access your organization's data
- Every action respects your existing permissions
- Audit trails track who did what
- Dynamic Client Registration (RFC 7591) with redirect URI validation
- Refresh token rotation with reuse detection

- **MCP Server** - The protocol implementation (FastMCP-based)
- **Tool Framework** - Structured tool definitions that tell AI clients what actions are available
- **OAuth 2.1 Layer** - PKCE-based authentication with JWT access tokens

## Limitations of text-based AI interfaces

MCP is powerful, but text-based AI chat has real limitations when you're working with Tallyfy's visual workflow features:

### Visual interface constraints

- **No process tracker**: Can't display Tallyfy's bird's-eye view of running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) with progress indicators
- **No template builder**: Can't show the drag-and-drop interface or visualize step dependencies
- **No aggregated views**: Can't present filterable views of processes and tasks at a glance
- **No live updates**: Can't show real-time progress as team members complete tasks

### Form field challenges

- **Dropdowns**: Text-based AI must list all options as plain text, making selection tedious
- **Multi-select inputs**: Form inputs lose their visual interface when reduced to text
- **Date/time pickers**: Calendar and time tools become manual text entry
- **File uploads**: Can't handle file uploads through conversation

### Assignment and collaboration barriers

- **Assignee selection**: Can't show Tallyfy's visual suggestions for [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/), [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/), job titles, and groups
- **Bulk operations**: Managing multiple assignments through individual text commands is slow
- **Collaboration**: Real-time features like simultaneous template editing become sequential

### Template creation limitations

- **Step visualization**: Can't display all steps at once or show their relationships visually
- **Reordering**: No drag-and-drop - must use text commands
- **Automation setup**: Complex [automation rules](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) are harder to configure through conversation
- **Preview**: Can't visually preview how a template will work before deploying it

## Where MCP works best

Text-based MCP shines in specific scenarios:

### Search and discovery

Ask specific questions, get targeted answers:

- "Find all templates related to employee onboarding that include background check steps"
- "Show me all customer onboarding processes that took longer than 5 days"
- "Which tasks are overdue and assigned to the sales team?"
- "Find templates that use the 'Budget Approval' form field"

### Template generation from documents

Got a messy document? AI turns it into structured templates:

- **Form field creation**: Upload forms and let AI generate [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) with validation rules
- **Flowchart conversion**: Turn process diagrams into [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) with proper step sequences
- **Automation generation**: Convert plain-language business rules into [automation rules](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/)
- **Bulk field creation**: Generate multiple related form fields from document analysis

### What-if scenario testing

- "If I set up an automation to route tasks by deal value, how would it handle these 5 example deals?"
- "What would happen if we removed the approval step for purchases under $1,000?"
- "How would task distribution change if we reassigned John's templates to Sarah?"
- "Based on historical data, estimate completion time if we add a review step"

### Process updates from changed documents

Compliance docs changed? AI spots differences and updates everything:

- "Here's our updated SOX compliance procedure. Update our audit template to match"
- AI identifies exactly what changed and updates only affected parts
- Compare old and new documents to generate precise template modifications
- Apply consistent changes across multiple templates from policy updates

### Pattern recognition and optimization

- "Look at one-off tasks added to hiring processes last month - which should become permanent template steps?"
- "Which steps consistently cause delays?"
- "Find similar templates that could be merged into one"
- "Identify patterns in high-performing processes and suggest improvements"

### Reporting with citations

- "Which step in our sales process has the longest average completion time?"
- "Show all instances where required approvals were skipped, with links to the processes"
- "How has customer onboarding time changed over the last 6 months?"
- "Which departments most frequently add ad-hoc tasks?"
