## Tallyfy MCP Server (Preview)

:::warning[Feature in Development]
The Tallyfy MCP Server is currently in development and **subject to change**. The features and capabilities described here represent the current state of development and may evolve before the official release.
:::

Tallyfy's MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server enables you to interact with your Tallyfy workflows using natural language through any AI platform that supports MCP. Instead of learning specific API endpoints or using web interfaces, you can simply describe what you want to accomplish, and the AI will execute the appropriate Tallyfy actions on your behalf.

### What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that allows AI assistants to securely connect to external systems and data sources. It provides a standardized way for AI models to access and interact with tools and resources while maintaining security and control.

### How Tallyfy MCP Server works

The Tallyfy MCP Server acts as a bridge between AI assistants (like Claude, ChatGPT, or others that support MCP) and your Tallyfy organization. You provide your Tallyfy API token to authenticate the connection, and then you can:

- Ask questions about your [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) and [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in natural language
- Create and manage tasks through conversation
- Analyze [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) and get suggestions for improvements
- Search across your organization's workflows
- Manage [users](/products/pro/documenting/members/) and [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/)

**Example interactions:**
- "Show me all overdue tasks for John"
- "Create a task for reviewing the quarterly budget, due next Friday"
- "What templates do we have for customer onboarding?"
- "Analyze the health of our 'Employee Onboarding' template"

### Current capabilities (Preview)

Based on the current development state, the MCP Server provides access to the following functionality organized by category:

## Search and discovery tools

**Search across your organization:**
- `search_for_tasks` - Find tasks using natural language queries
- `search_for_processes` - Locate specific [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) by description or criteria
- `search_for_templates` - Discover [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) that match your needs

**Examples:**
- "Find all tasks related to budget approval"
- "Search for processes containing 'customer onboarding'"
- "Show me templates for HR workflows"

## User and access management

**Organization members:**
- `get_organization_users` - List all [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) in your organization
- `get_organization_users_list` - Get a simplified list of users
- `invite_user_to_organization` - Add new [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) to your Tallyfy organization

**Guest management:**
- `get_organization_guests` - View all [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) with access to your workflows
- `get_organization_guests_list` - Get a simplified guest list

**Helper functions:**
- `resolve_user_ids` - Convert user names or emails to internal IDs
- `resolve_group_ids` - Convert group names to internal identifiers

## Task management and tracking

**Personal and team tasks:**
- `get_my_tasks` - Retrieve your assigned [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/)
- `get_user_tasks` - View tasks assigned to specific team members
- `get_tasks_for_process` - List all tasks within a particular [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)

**Task creation:**
- `create_task_from_text` - Create new tasks using natural language descriptions with automatic due date extraction

**Process monitoring:**
- `get_organization_runs` - View all running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) with filtering options

## Template design and optimization

**Template analysis:**
- `get_template` - Retrieve detailed information about specific [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)
- `assess_template_health` - Get comprehensive analysis of template effectiveness
- `get_step_dependencies` - Understand how steps relate to each other
- `suggest_step_deadline` - Get AI-powered deadline recommendations

**Form field management:**
- `add_form_field_to_step` - Add new [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to template steps
- `update_form_field` - Modify existing form field properties
- `move_form_field` - Relocate form fields between steps
- `delete_form_field` - Remove unnecessary form fields
- `suggest_form_fields_for_step` - Get AI suggestions for useful form fields

**Dropdown field management:**
- `get_dropdown_options` - View available options for dropdown fields
- `update_dropdown_options` - Modify dropdown choices

**Template structure:**
- `add_assignees_to_step` - Assign [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) or [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) to template steps
- `edit_description_on_step` - Update step descriptions and instructions
- `add_step_to_template` - Insert new steps into templates

## Automation and workflow logic

**Automation rules:**
- `create_automation_rule` - Set up new [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) for templates
- `update_automation_rule` - Modify existing automation logic
- `delete_automation_rule` - Remove automation rules
- `analyze_template_automations` - Get insights into current automation setup

**Optimization:**
- `consolidate_automation_rules` - Simplify complex automation setups
- `suggest_automation_consolidation` - Get recommendations for automation improvements
- `get_step_visibility_conditions` - Understand when steps appear or hide

**Kickoff optimization:**
- `suggest_kickoff_fields` - Get recommendations for process launch [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/)

## System utilities

**Server management:**
- `get_server_status` - Check MCP server health and connectivity
- `get_available_tools` - List all available MCP tools and their descriptions

### Security and authentication

The MCP Server requires your Tallyfy API token for authentication. This ensures that:

- Only authorized users can access your organization's data
- All actions are performed with your permissions and access levels
- Audit trails maintain proper attribution of actions
- Data security follows Tallyfy's existing [security](/products/pro/compliance/) protocols

### Getting started (When available)

Once the MCP Server is officially released, you'll be able to:

1. **Set up the connection** using your Tallyfy API credentials
2. **Configure your AI assistant** to connect to the Tallyfy MCP Server
3. **Start conversing** with your Tallyfy data using natural language
4. **Perform complex workflows** through simple descriptions

### Future capabilities

The development roadmap includes expanding the MCP Server to support:

- Process launching and management
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Integration with other [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) platforms
- Custom workflow automation through conversational interfaces
- Team collaboration features

### Technical architecture

The current implementation includes:

- **Core SDK** - Python-based SDK for Tallyfy API interaction
- **MCP Server** - Model Context Protocol server implementation
- **Tool Framework** - Structured tool definitions for AI interaction
- **Authentication Layer** - Secure token-based API access
- **Natural Language Processing** - Smart parsing of user intents and data extraction

Stay tuned for official release announcements and detailed setup instructions as this feature moves from development to production.
