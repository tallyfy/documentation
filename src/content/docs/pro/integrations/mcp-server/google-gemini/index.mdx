:::note[MCP client compatibility]
Google announced official MCP support in December 2025. Gemini supports managed MCP servers for Google Cloud services and connects to external MCP servers through the Gemini CLI. MCP is governed by the Agentic AI Foundation under the Linux Foundation.
:::

Google Gemini connects to Tallyfy's MCP server through OAuth 2.1, letting you manage workflows with natural language. You can use the Gemini CLI for local connections or Google Cloud's managed MCP infrastructure for enterprise setups.

## Gemini MCP support status

- **Official support** - MCP announced December 2025 for Gemini models
- **Managed MCP servers** - Google Cloud provides managed servers for Maps, BigQuery, Compute Engine, Kubernetes Engine
- **Gemini CLI** - FastMCP integration for local MCP server connections
- **Transport** - Streamable HTTP
- **Apigee integration** - Translate standard APIs to MCP servers

## Prerequisites

- Google Cloud account with Gemini API access
- Tallyfy account with an active organization
- Gemini CLI installed (for local MCP connections)

## Setting up the connection

<Steps>

1. **Install Gemini CLI**

   ```bash
   npm install -g @google/gemini-cli
   gemini --version
   ```

2. **Configure MCP server connection**

   Create a configuration file for the Tallyfy MCP server:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "tallyfy": {
         "url": "https://mcp.tallyfy.com",
         "transport": "streamable-http",
         "auth": {
           "type": "oauth2",
           "authorization_url": "https://go.tallyfy.com/mcp/oauth/authorize",
           "token_url": "https://go.tallyfy.com/mcp/oauth/token",
           "scopes": ["mcp.tasks.read", "mcp.tasks.write", "mcp.processes.read", "mcp.processes.write", "mcp.templates.read", "mcp.templates.write", "mcp.users.read"]
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   Tallyfy uses dot-separated scopes with read/write suffixes (e.g., `mcp.tasks.read`). The full list of available scopes includes `mcp.users.read`, `mcp.users.write`, `mcp.tasks.read`, `mcp.tasks.write`, `mcp.processes.read`, `mcp.processes.write`, `mcp.templates.read`, `mcp.templates.write`, `mcp.forms.read`, `mcp.forms.write`, `mcp.automation.read`, and `mcp.automation.write`.

3. **Authenticate with Tallyfy**

   ```bash
   gemini mcp auth tallyfy
   ```

   This opens a browser window where you'll authorize Gemini's access to your Tallyfy workspace and select your organization.

4. **Verify the connection**

   ```bash
   gemini chat --mcp tallyfy
   > Show me all open tasks in Tallyfy
   ```

5. **Use in Google Cloud (optional)**

   For enterprise deployments, configure Tallyfy as a managed MCP server in Google Cloud:

   ```yaml
   # gemini-mcp-config.yaml
   apiVersion: aiplatform.googleapis.com/v1
   kind: McpServerConfig
   metadata:
     name: tallyfy-mcp
   spec:
     endpoint: https://mcp.tallyfy.com
     authentication:
       oauth2:
         clientId: ${TALLYFY_CLIENT_ID}
         authorizationEndpoint: https://go.tallyfy.com/mcp/oauth/authorize
         tokenEndpoint: https://go.tallyfy.com/mcp/oauth/token
   ```

</Steps>

## Practical examples

### Task management via natural language

**Prompt:**
```
Using Tallyfy, find all overdue tasks and create a summary grouped by assignee.
```

Gemini will call the `search_for_tasks` tool with an overdue filter, group results by assignee, and generate a formatted summary.

### Process analytics

**Prompt:**
```
Analyze our "Customer Onboarding" processes from the last month and identify bottlenecks.
```

Gemini queries process history through MCP tools, calculates step completion times, and identifies which steps take longest.

### Template review

**Prompt:**
```
Review our "Invoice Processing" template and suggest improvements.
```

Gemini retrieves the template structure using `get_template`, analyzes step dependencies and automation rules, then suggests optimizations.

## Gemini-specific features

### Google Cloud integration

Since Gemini lives inside Google's ecosystem, you can combine Tallyfy data with other Google services:

- **BigQuery** - Analyze Tallyfy process data alongside your data warehouse
- **Cloud Run** - Deploy custom MCP logic at scale
- **Pub/Sub** - Set up event-driven workflow triggers

### Multimodal input

Gemini can process images and documents alongside text, which helps with visual inspection workflows or document review processes.

### Vertex AI agents

Build multi-agent systems that combine Tallyfy with other services through Google's Agent Development Kit - useful for orchestrating across multiple tools with governance controls.

## Limitations

### Feature rollout

MCP support is new (December 2025). Some managed MCP servers are still rolling out, regional availability varies, and enterprise features may need additional configuration.

### Text-based constraints

Like other AI chat interfaces, Gemini can't display Tallyfy's visual process tracker. Complex forms become text-based interactions, and you'll need to ask explicitly for status updates.

### Google Cloud dependencies

Managed MCP servers require a Google Cloud account. Some features need specific IAM permissions, and Cloud usage has its own billing.

## Best use cases

### Data-driven optimization

Combine BigQuery analytics with Tallyfy process data:
```
Correlate customer support ticket data from BigQuery with our support process completion times in Tallyfy.
```

### Multi-service automation

Orchestrate across Google Cloud and Tallyfy:
```
When a new document is uploaded to Cloud Storage, trigger the document review process in Tallyfy and notify the team via Gmail.
```

### Process monitoring

Use Gemini's analytical capabilities for workflow insights:
```
Monitor all active processes and alert me to any at risk of missing their SLA, with root cause analysis.
```

## Security

- **Authentication** - OAuth 2.1 with PKCE (S256 code challenge). Tokens are stored in Google's infrastructure with automatic refresh token rotation.
- **Data handling** - Processed according to Google's AI policies, with enterprise controls via Vertex AI and audit logging in Cloud Logging.
- **Network** - All traffic over HTTPS, with VPC Service Controls and private connectivity options for enterprise.
