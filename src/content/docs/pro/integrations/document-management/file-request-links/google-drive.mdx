## File requests for Google Drive

Google Drive doesn't have a built-in file request feature. Unlike Dropbox or Box, you can't generate a link that lets people upload files without a Google account. Several workarounds exist though - from third-party tools to Google Forms.

## Why Google Drive can't do this natively

Google requires authentication for all file uploads. Recipients must have a Google account, sign in, and have explicit upload permissions. That's a problem when you're collecting documents from clients or vendors who don't use Google.

## Option 1 - Third-party file request tools

These services create upload forms that connect directly to your Google Drive.

### FileDrop

FileDrop creates upload forms that save straight to your Google Drive:

<Steps>
1. **Connect your Google Drive**

   Sign up and authorize access to your Drive.

2. **Create an upload form**

   Add custom fields, instructions, and branding.

3. **Pick the destination folder**

   Choose which Google Drive folder receives uploads.

4. **Copy the link**

   Grab the form URL and store it in Tallyfy.

5. **Collect files**

   Anyone can upload without a Google account.
</Steps>

**Pricing**: Free tier available with limitations, paid plans for higher volumes.

### File Request Pro

File Request Pro adds features like custom branding, file type restrictions, size limits, email notifications on upload, and metadata collection fields.

**Setup**: Connect Google Drive, create a request, copy the link to Tallyfy.

### Other alternatives

- **JotForm** - form builder with Google Drive integration
- **Formfacade** - converts Google Forms to allow file uploads
- **Upload Files to Drive** - free Chrome extension

## Option 2 - Google Forms with file upload

Google Forms can collect files, but with significant limitations:

<Steps>
1. **Create a Google Form**

   Go to forms.google.com and start a new form.

2. **Add a file upload question**

   Click **+** and select **File upload** as the question type.

3. **Configure upload settings**

   Choose allowed file types, set max file size (1 GB to 10 GB), and specify the max number of files.

4. **Set folder destination**

   Files go to a new folder in your Drive - you can't pick an existing folder.

5. **Share the form**

   Copy the form link and add it to Tallyfy.
</Steps>

**Critical limitation**: Uploaders must sign in with a Google account, which defeats the purpose for most external collection scenarios.

## Option 3 - Shared folder with managed access

When everyone involved has a Google account:

<Steps>
1. **Create a dedicated folder**

   Make a new Google Drive folder for uploads.

2. **Open sharing settings**

   Right-click the folder and select **Share**.

3. **Set permissions**

   Add specific emails with **Contributor** access (upload but not delete).

4. **Copy the shareable link**

   Click **Copy link** and set access to **Anyone with the link can edit**.

5. **Add to Tallyfy**

   Store this link in your workflow.
</Steps>

## Option 4 - Google Workspace automation

If your organization uses Google Workspace, you can build a custom upload endpoint with Apps Script:

```javascript
// Sample Apps Script for file upload endpoint
function doPost(e) {
  var folder = DriveApp.getFolderById('FOLDER_ID');
  var blob = Utilities.newBlob(
    Utilities.base64Decode(e.parameter.data), 
    e.parameter.mimeType, 
    e.parameter.fileName
  );
  folder.createFile(blob);
  return ContentService.createTextOutput('Success');
}
```

Deploy this as a web app. It requires technical setup but gives you full control over the upload flow.

## Comparing third-party solutions

| Feature | FileDrop | File Request Pro | JotForm | Google Forms |
|---------|----------|-----------------|---------|--------------|
| No account needed | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| Free tier | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Custom branding | Paid | ✓ | ✓ | Limited |
| File size limits | 5 GB | 5 GB | 1 GB | 10 GB |
| Metadata fields | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Direct to Drive | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

## Security considerations

When using third-party tools, keep these in mind:

- **Data flow** - files pass through the third-party service before reaching Google Drive, so make sure the service meets your security standards
- **Access scope** - review which Google Drive permissions you're granting and limit to specific folders when possible
- **Compliance** - verify the tool meets your industry's standards (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.)

## Tips for implementation

- Test the full upload flow before adding it to production workflows
- Tell uploaders exactly what file types and sizes you'll accept
- Set up Google Drive notifications so you know when new files arrive
- Move processed files to archive folders to keep upload destinations clean
