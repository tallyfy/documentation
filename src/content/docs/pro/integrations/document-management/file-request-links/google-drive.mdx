## File requests for Google Drive

Here's the reality - Google Drive doesn't have a built-in file request feature. Unlike Dropbox or Box, you can't generate a link that lets people upload files without a Google account. But don't worry. Several reliable workarounds exist, from third-party tools to creative uses of Google Forms.

## Understanding the limitation

Google requires authentication for file uploads. When you share a folder for uploads, recipients must:
- Have a Google account
- Sign in to access the folder
- Have explicit upload permissions

This creates friction for external document collection, especially from clients or vendors who might not have Google accounts.

## Option 1: Third-party file request tools

Several services bridge this gap by creating upload forms that connect to your Google Drive.

### FileDrop

FileDrop creates professional upload forms that save directly to your Google Drive:

<Steps>
1. **Connect your Google Drive**
   
   Sign up for FileDrop and authorize access to your Google Drive.

2. **Create an upload form**
   
   Design your form with custom fields, instructions, and branding.

3. **Configure destination**
   
   Select which Google Drive folder receives the uploads.

4. **Get your link**
   
   Copy the form URL and store it in Tallyfy.

5. **Collect files**
   
   Anyone can upload through your form without needing a Google account.
</Steps>

**Pricing**: Free tier available with limitations, paid plans for higher volumes.

### File Request Pro

File Request Pro offers similar functionality with additional features:

- Custom branding and logos
- Multiple file type restrictions
- Size limit controls
- Email notifications on upload
- Metadata collection fields

**Setup**: Connect Google Drive, create request, copy link to Tallyfy.

### Other alternatives

- **JotForm**: Form builder with Google Drive integration
- **Formfacade**: Converts Google Forms to allow file uploads
- **Upload Files to Drive**: Simple, free Chrome extension

## Option 2: Google Forms with file upload

Google Forms can collect files, but with significant limitations:

<Steps>
1. **Create a Google Form**
   
   Go to forms.google.com and start a new form.

2. **Add file upload question**
   
   Click the **+** button and select **File upload** as the question type.

3. **Configure upload settings**
   
   - Choose file types allowed
   - Set maximum file size (1 GB to 10 GB)
   - Specify maximum number of files

4. **Set folder destination**
   
   Files go to a new folder in your Drive (can't choose existing folder).

5. **Share the form**
   
   Get the form link and add it to Tallyfy.
</Steps>

**Critical limitation**: Uploaders must sign in with a Google account. This defeats the purpose for many external collection scenarios.

## Option 3: Shared folder with managed access

For situations where Google accounts are acceptable:

<Steps>
1. **Create a Google Drive folder**
   
   Make a dedicated folder for uploads.

2. **Configure sharing settings**
   
   Right-click the folder and select **Share**.

3. **Set permissions**
   
   Add specific emails with **Contributor** access (can upload but not delete).

4. **Generate shareable link**
   
   Click **Copy link** and set access to **Anyone with the link can edit**.

5. **Add to Tallyfy**
   
   Store this link in your workflow.
</Steps>

Users need Google accounts but can upload directly to your folder.

## Option 4: Google Workspace automation

For organizations with Google Workspace, use Apps Script:

```javascript
// Sample Apps Script for file upload endpoint
function doPost(e) {
  var folder = DriveApp.getFolderById('FOLDER_ID');
  var blob = Utilities.newBlob(
    Utilities.base64Decode(e.parameter.data), 
    e.parameter.mimeType, 
    e.parameter.fileName
  );
  folder.createFile(blob);
  return ContentService.createTextOutput('Success');
}
```

Deploy as a web app to create a custom upload endpoint. Requires technical setup but provides full control.

## Comparing third-party solutions

| Feature | FileDrop | File Request Pro | JotForm | Google Forms |
|---------|----------|-----------------|---------|--------------|
| No account needed | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ |
| Free tier | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Custom branding | Paid | ✓ | ✓ | Limited |
| File size limits | 5 GB | 5 GB | 1 GB | 10 GB |
| Metadata fields | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Direct to Drive | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

## Security considerations

When using third-party tools:

**Data flow** - Files pass through the third-party service before reaching Google Drive. Ensure the service meets your security requirements.

**Access scope** - Review what Google Drive permissions you're granting. Limit to specific folders when possible.

**Compliance** - Verify the tool meets your industry's compliance standards (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.).

**Vendor stability** - Choose established services with clear data handling policies.

## Best practices for implementation

**Test thoroughly** - Try the complete upload flow before adding to production workflows.

**Provide clear instructions** - Tell uploaders exactly what file types and sizes are accepted.

**Monitor your folder** - Set up Google Drive notifications for new files.

**Regular cleanup** - Move processed files to archive folders to keep upload destinations organized.

**Have a backup plan** - Keep alternative upload methods ready in case third-party services have issues.

## Cost-benefit analysis

Consider these factors when choosing your approach:

**Volume** - High-volume collection justifies paid tools with better features.

**Security requirements** - Sensitive documents might require keeping everything within Google's ecosystem.

**User base** - If most uploaders have Google accounts, native sharing might suffice.

**Budget** - Free tools work for occasional use, but paid options offer reliability and support.

## Summary

While Google Drive lacks native file request functionality, workable solutions exist. Third-party tools like FileDrop and File Request Pro provide the smoothest experience for external users. For internal workflows or when Google accounts are acceptable, folder sharing or Google Forms can work. Choose based on your security requirements, user base, and workflow volume.

The extra step of using third-party tools is worth it if Google Drive is your primary document platform. You maintain your existing storage, permissions, and backup systems while adding the upload functionality you need.
