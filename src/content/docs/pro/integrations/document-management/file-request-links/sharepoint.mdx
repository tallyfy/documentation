## Using SharePoint and OneDrive file requests

SharePoint and OneDrive for Business share the same file request technology. This feature lets you collect files from anyone - they don't need a Microsoft account or access to your SharePoint site. It's built into Microsoft 365 and works seamlessly with existing SharePoint permissions.

## Prerequisites

- SharePoint Online or OneDrive for Business account
- Your administrator must enable file requests
- "Anyone" link sharing must be allowed in your tenant
- The feature isn't available for Office 365 Germany or 21Vianet

## Creating a file request in SharePoint

<Steps>
1. **Navigate to your document library**
   
   Open the SharePoint site and go to the document library where files should be uploaded.

2. **Select or create a folder**
   
   Click on the folder that will receive uploads, or create a new one.

3. **Open file request**
   
   From the command bar, click **Request files**.

4. **Configure the request**
   
   In the popup dialog:
   - Enter a descriptive name for your request
   - Add instructions about what files you need
   - Review the folder path where files will go

5. **Generate the link**
   
   Click **Next** to generate your unique upload link.

6. **Copy and share**
   
   Copy the link and paste it into a Tallyfy short text field. You can also email it directly from SharePoint.

7. **Set expiration (optional)**
   
   Your admin can configure links to expire after a set number of days (default is 30 days).
</Steps>

## Creating a file request in OneDrive

<Steps>
1. **Open OneDrive for Business**
   
   Navigate to business.onedrive.com and sign in.

2. **Select destination folder**
   
   Choose or create the folder for uploads.

3. **Start file request**
   
   Click the folder, then select **Request files** from the toolbar.

4. **Add request details**
   
   Name your request and provide clear instructions.

5. **Copy the link**
   
   Get the generated link and store it in Tallyfy.
</Steps>

## What uploaders see

The experience is intentionally simple:

1. They click your link and see a clean upload page
2. SharePoint asks for their first and last name (to identify uploads)
3. They select or drag files to upload
4. Files upload directly to your specified folder
5. They see a confirmation when complete

Each uploaded file gets prefixed with the uploader's name for easy identification.

## Security and compliance

SharePoint file requests maintain your security posture:

**No access beyond upload** - Users can only add files, not view, edit, or delete existing content.

**Audit trails** - All uploads are logged in SharePoint's audit system for compliance tracking.

**Data location** - Files stay in your tenant's geographic region per your data residency settings.

**Automatic scanning** - Microsoft Defender scans all uploads for malware.

**Compliance inheritance** - Uploaded files inherit retention policies and sensitivity labels from the destination folder.

## Advanced configuration with Power Automate

You can automate file request link generation:

```
Automated workflow example:
1. Tallyfy triggers Power Automate when process starts
2. Power Automate creates a new SharePoint folder
3. Generates a file request link for that folder
4. Updates Tallyfy process with the link via API
5. Sends email to recipient with upload instructions
```

This eliminates manual link creation while maintaining unique upload destinations per process.

## Integration patterns for Tallyfy

**Pattern 1: Department-based collection**
Create permanent file request links for each department:
- HR uploads → /HR Submissions/
- Finance uploads → /Finance Documents/
- Legal uploads → /Legal Files/

**Pattern 2: Time-based organization**
Generate monthly folders with corresponding file requests:
- January → /Uploads/YYYY-01/
- February → /Uploads/YYYY-02/

**Pattern 3: Process-specific folders**
Create unique folders and file requests per process instance for maximum organization.

## Managing file requests

Monitor active file requests:

1. Go to the SharePoint document library
2. Click **Manage access** in the toolbar
3. View all active file request links
4. Stop sharing to disable specific links

Your SharePoint admin can also view all file requests across the tenant for governance.

## Limitations to consider

**Expiration settings** - Links expire based on admin configuration (typically 30 days).

**File naming** - SharePoint adds the uploader's name as a prefix, which can't be disabled.

**No metadata collection** - Unlike Box, you can't add custom fields to the upload form.

**Character limits** - Some special characters in filenames may cause upload issues.

## Troubleshooting common issues

**"This link has expired"** - File request links expire after the configured time. Create a new request.

**"Access denied"** - Your admin may have disabled "Anyone" links. Contact IT to enable file requests.

**Large file failures** - SharePoint supports files up to 250 GB, but network timeouts may affect very large uploads.

**Missing uploads** - Check if files are in a subfolder or if the uploader's name prefix is causing confusion.

## Alternative: Teams integration

For internal workflows, consider using Teams channels:

1. Create a Teams channel for document collection
2. Add a SharePoint library tab
3. Share the Teams channel link through Tallyfy
4. Internal users can drag and drop files directly

This provides more collaboration but requires Teams access.

## Administrator requirements

If file requests aren't working, your admin needs to:

1. Enable "Anyone" links in SharePoint admin center
2. Configure `OneDriveRequestFilesLinkEnabled` to `$true`
3. Set `OneDriveRequestFilesLinkExpirationInDays` (1-730 days)
4. Ensure your SharePoint site allows external sharing

## Summary

SharePoint file requests integrate naturally with Microsoft 365 environments. While they lack some advanced features of dedicated tools, they're included with your existing licenses and maintain your Microsoft security and compliance standards. For organizations already invested in SharePoint, it's the logical choice for document collection workflows.
