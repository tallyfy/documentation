## Creating Dropbox file requests for Tallyfy workflows

Anyone can upload files to your Dropbox without needing an account, and you control exactly where those files land. It's one of the simplest file request tools available.

## Prerequisites

You'll need a Dropbox account with file request capabilities:
- **Basic/Plus/Family plans** - files up to 2 GB each
- **Professional/Business plans** - files up to 250 GB each
- **Business plans** - deadlines and password protection options

## Creating your first file request

<Steps>
1. **Access file requests**
   
   Sign in to Dropbox.com and click **File requests** in the left sidebar.

2. **Start new request**
   
   Click **New request** at the top of your file request list.

3. **Configure the request**

   Enter a descriptive title like "Client Documents - [Client Name]" and optionally describe what files you're expecting.

4. **Choose destination folder**
   
   Dropbox creates a new folder by default. Click **Change folder** to select an existing folder if preferred.

5. **Set optional security**

   For Professional and Business accounts:
   - Check **Set a deadline** to auto-close the request
   - Add a password for extra security (share it separately)

6. **Copy the link**
   
   Click **Copy** next to "Share a link" to get your unique upload URL.

7. **Store in Tallyfy**
   
   Paste this link into a short text field in your Tallyfy template or process.
</Steps>

## What uploaders see

When someone clicks your file request link, they get a simple upload page with your title and description. They drag and drop files (or click to browse), optionally enter their name and email, then click **Upload**. That's it.

Files appear immediately in your Dropbox folder with the uploader's name (if provided) as a filename prefix.

## Best practices for Tallyfy integration

**Use descriptive titles** - Include the process name and instance identifier so you can match uploads to specific workflows.

**Create unique requests per process** - Don't reuse links across instances. A fresh request per run keeps documents clearly separated.

**Set reasonable deadlines** - If your plan supports it, align deadlines with your process timeline plus a buffer.

**Monitor the folder** - Set up Dropbox notifications for new uploads so nothing slips through.

## Handling multiple file types

If a process needs different document types, create separate file requests with distinct destination folders:

```
Passport Documents → /Client Files/[Name]/Passport/
Tax Documents → /Client Files/[Name]/Tax/
Medical Records → /Client Files/[Name]/Medical/
```

Store each link in a separate Tallyfy text field and reference them in the relevant tasks.

## Security considerations

Dropbox file requests are secure by default:

- Uploaders can't see existing files in your folder
- Each request URL is unique and unguessable
- You can close requests manually anytime
- Business accounts can require passwords
- All uploads are scanned for viruses

## Limitations

**File size limits** vary by plan - 2 GB for personal, 250 GB for business.

**No automatic upload notification** - You won't know files arrived unless you've configured folder watching.

**Name and email are optional** - Uploaders can skip identifying themselves.

## Automation options

Dropbox provides a file requests API (`/2/file_requests/create`) for creating requests programmatically. You can also:

- Pre-create batches of file requests and store links in a spreadsheet
- Use Dropbox folder actions to trigger notifications when files arrive
- Use middleware tools like Zapier to connect Dropbox upload events to Tallyfy

## Troubleshooting

**"Request not found" error** - The request may have expired or been manually closed. Create a new request.

**Files not appearing** - Check if uploads completed successfully. Large files may take time to sync.

**Duplicate filenames** - Dropbox automatically adds numbers to duplicate filenames to prevent overwrites.

## Alternative - shared folder approach

For internal teams or trusted partners, Dropbox shared folders work too:

1. Create a shared folder in Dropbox
2. Generate a folder invite link
3. Store this link in Tallyfy
4. Users with Dropbox accounts can add files directly

You get more collaboration features, but everyone needs a Dropbox account.
