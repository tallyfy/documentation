## Creating Dropbox file requests for Tallyfy workflows

Dropbox offers one of the most straightforward file request implementations. Anyone can upload files to your Dropbox without needing an account, and you control exactly where those files land.

## Prerequisites

You'll need a Dropbox account with file request capabilities:
- **Basic/Plus/Family plans**: Can request files up to 2 GB each
- **Professional/Business plans**: Can request files up to 250 GB each
- **Business plans**: Additional options for deadlines and password protection

## Creating your first file request

<Steps>
1. **Access file requests**
   
   Sign in to Dropbox.com and click **File requests** in the left sidebar.

2. **Start new request**
   
   Click **New request** at the top of your file request list.

3. **Configure the request**
   
   Enter a descriptive title like "Client Documents - [Client Name]" and add optional description for what files you're expecting.

4. **Choose destination folder**
   
   Dropbox creates a new folder by default. Click **Change folder** to select an existing folder if preferred.

5. **Set optional security**
   
   For Professional and Business accounts:
   - Check **Set a deadline** to auto-close the request
   - Add a password for extra security (share it separately with the uploader)

6. **Copy the link**
   
   Click **Copy** next to "Share a link" to get your unique upload URL.

7. **Store in Tallyfy**
   
   Paste this link into a short text field in your Tallyfy template or process.
</Steps>

## How uploaders experience it

When someone clicks your file request link:

1. They see a simple upload page with your request title and description
2. They drag and drop files or click to browse
3. Optionally enter their name and email (Dropbox asks but doesn't require this)
4. Click **Upload** to send files directly to your folder

Files appear immediately in your Dropbox folder with the uploader's name (if provided) as a filename prefix.

## Best practices for Tallyfy integration

**Use descriptive titles** - Include the process name and instance identifier in your file request title. This helps you match uploads to specific workflows.

**Create unique requests** - Generate a new file request for each process instance rather than reusing links. This maintains clear document separation.

**Set reasonable deadlines** - If your plan supports it, set deadlines that align with your process timeline plus a buffer.

**Monitor the folder** - Check your Dropbox regularly or set up notifications for new uploads.

## Managing multiple file types

For processes requiring different document types, create separate file requests:

```
Passport Documents → /Client Files/[Name]/Passport/
Tax Documents → /Client Files/[Name]/Tax/
Medical Records → /Client Files/[Name]/Medical/
```

Store each link in a different Tallyfy text field and reference them in the appropriate tasks.

## Security considerations

Dropbox file requests provide solid security:

- Uploaders can't see existing files in your folder
- Each request has a unique, unguessable URL
- You can close requests manually anytime
- Business accounts can require passwords
- All uploads are scanned for viruses

## Limitations to consider

**File size limits** vary by plan - 2 GB for personal plans, 250 GB for business plans.

**No upload confirmation** - Dropbox doesn't automatically notify you when files arrive unless you configure folder watching.

**Name/email optional** - Uploaders can skip identifying themselves, though most provide this information.

## Automation options

While Dropbox doesn't offer API access for creating file requests, you can:

- Pre-create batches of file requests and store links in a spreadsheet
- Use Dropbox folder actions to trigger notifications when files arrive
- Integrate with Tallyfy webhooks to track when tasks complete

## Troubleshooting

**"Request not found" error** - The request may have expired or been manually closed. Create a new request.

**Files not appearing** - Check if uploads completed successfully. Large files may take time to sync.

**Duplicate filenames** - Dropbox automatically adds numbers to duplicate filenames to prevent overwrites.

## Alternative: Shared folder approach

For internal teams or trusted partners, consider Dropbox shared folders instead:

1. Create a shared folder in Dropbox
2. Generate a folder invite link
3. Store this link in Tallyfy
4. Users with Dropbox accounts can add files directly

This provides more collaboration features but requires Dropbox accounts.

## Summary

Dropbox file requests offer a reliable, user-friendly way to collect documents in Tallyfy workflows. The setup takes minutes, uploaders need no training, and your documents stay organized in your Dropbox folder structure. It's particularly effective for client-facing processes where simplicity matters most.
