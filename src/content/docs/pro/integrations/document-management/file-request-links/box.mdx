## What are Box file requests?

Box File Request lets you collect documents from anyone - even people without Box accounts. Requires a Business plan or higher, but you get strong security controls suited to regulated industries.

## Prerequisites

- Box Business, Business Plus, or Enterprise account
- Folder creation permissions in Box
- Administrator approval if your organization restricts external sharing

## Creating a Box file request

<Steps>
1. **Select your destination folder**

   Go to the Box folder where collected files should land.

2. **Open the sharing panel**

   Click the folder, then find the sharing panel on the right.

3. **Create the file request**

   Under **File Request**, click **Create Link**.

4. **Enable and configure**

   Toggle the link to **Enabled**. Click **Edit** for more options.

5. **Set security options**

   - Require Box login for uploaders
   - Set an expiration date
   - Turn on email notifications

6. **Add metadata fields**

   Collect extra info alongside files:
   - Email address (can be required)
   - File description
   - Custom metadata fields

7. **Copy your link**

   Paste the generated URL into a Tallyfy short text field.
</Steps>

## Security features

**Identity verification** - Require uploaders to sign in with a Box account (free accounts work). Captures their verified email with every upload.

**Email validation** - Even without Box login, you can require uploaders to verify their email.

**Access controls** - Your Box admin can enforce org-wide policies for all file requests.

**Virus scanning** - All uploads are scanned automatically before they're accessible.

## What uploaders see

1. Your custom message explaining what files you need
2. Sign-in or email verification (if configured)
3. Required metadata fields to fill out
4. Drag-and-drop or browse to select files
5. Box uploads and notifies you (if enabled)

## Metadata collection

Require structured information with each upload:

```text
Example metadata setup:
- Uploader Email: [Required]
- Document Type: [Dropdown: Contract, Invoice, Receipt]
- Reference Number: [Text field]
- Description: [Text area]
```

Metadata stays attached to files, making them easier to find later.

## Using Box file requests with Tallyfy

**Simple collection** - One Box file request link per process, shared across tasks.

**Categorized uploads** - Separate file requests per document type:
- Financial → /Client Files/Financial/
- Legal → /Client Files/Legal/
- Identity → /Client Files/Identity/

**Maximum security** - Unique file requests per process instance with short expiration windows.

## Automation options

Box's API supports:

- Creating file requests programmatically
- Webhook notifications when files arrive
- Auto-moving uploads to permanent storage
- Triggering Tallyfy API calls on upload completion

## Managing active links

1. Go to your folder on Box.com
2. Check the sharing panel for active requests
3. Disable links once collection is done
4. Review upload history in the admin console

## Best practices

**Folder organization** - Mirror your process structure in your Box folder hierarchy.

**Naming conventions** - Use consistent naming like `[Process]-[Date]-[Client]`.

**Regular cleanup** - Disable old file request links quarterly.

**Monitor usage** - Check Box's audit logs to see who's uploading.

## Limitations

**Business plan required** - File requests aren't available on personal Box accounts.

**Single folder destination** - Each request points to one folder. You can't split uploads dynamically.

**No conditional logic** - Can't show or hide metadata fields based on previous selections.

## Alternative - Box folder invites

For trusted partners who have Box accounts:

1. Create a Box folder
2. Click **Share** and invite collaborators
3. Set permissions to "Uploader" (can only add files)
4. Share the folder link through Tallyfy

More features, but requires Box accounts on both sides.

## Troubleshooting

**"Access denied"** - Your org admin may have restricted file requests.

**Missing metadata** - Confirm required fields are set in file request settings.

**Upload failures** - Check file size limits (5 GB default, up to 250 GB).

**Link not working** - The link may be disabled or expired.

## Cost considerations

File requests come with Business plans but count toward your storage quota. Watch usage if you collect large files often.
