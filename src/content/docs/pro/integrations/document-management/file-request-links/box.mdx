## Setting up Box file requests for document collection

Box File Request gives you enterprise-grade security for collecting documents from anyone. The feature requires a Box Business plan but provides advanced controls perfect for regulated industries.

## Prerequisites

- Box Business, Business Plus, or Enterprise account
- Folder creation permissions in Box
- Administrator approval if your organization restricts external sharing

## Creating a Box file request

<Steps>
1. **Select your destination folder**
   
   Navigate to the Box folder where you want collected files to appear.

2. **Open the sharing panel**
   
   Click the folder to select it, then look for the sharing panel on the right side.

3. **Create the file request**
   
   Under **File Request**, click **Create Link**.

4. **Enable and configure the link**
   
   Toggle the link to **Enabled** if it isn't already. Click **Edit** to access configuration options.

5. **Set security options**

   Configure based on your security needs:
   - Require Box login for uploaders
   - Set expiration date
   - Enable email notifications for uploads

6. **Add metadata fields**
   
   Box lets you collect additional information:
   - Email address (can be required)
   - File description
   - Custom metadata fields

7. **Copy your link**
   
   Copy the generated URL and store it in a Tallyfy short text field.
</Steps>

## Enhanced security features

Box provides enterprise-level security options:

**Identity verification** - Require uploaders to sign in with a Box account (free accounts work). This captures their verified email address with every upload.

**Email validation** - Even without Box login, you can require uploaders to provide and verify their email address.

**Access controls** - Your Box administrator can enforce organization-wide policies for all file requests.

**Virus scanning** - All uploads are automatically scanned before they're accessible.

## The uploader experience

When someone accesses your Box file request:

1. They see your custom message explaining what files you need
2. If configured, they must sign in or verify their email
3. They complete any metadata fields you've required
4. They drag and drop or browse to select files
5. Box uploads the files and notifies you (if configured)

## Metadata collection

Box's metadata feature adds powerful capabilities:

```
Example metadata setup:
- Uploader Email: [Required]
- Document Type: [Dropdown: Contract, Invoice, Receipt]
- Reference Number: [Text field]
- Description: [Text area]
```

This metadata appears with the uploaded files, making organization and searching easier.

## Integration with Tallyfy workflows

**For simple collection** - Store one Box file request link per process and share it in multiple tasks.

**For categorized uploads** - Create multiple file requests for different document types:
- Financial documents → /Client Files/Financial/
- Legal documents → /Client Files/Legal/
- Identity documents → /Client Files/Identity/

**For maximum security** - Generate unique file requests for each process instance and set short expiration windows.

## Automation capabilities

Box provides APIs for advanced automation:

- Programmatically create file requests via Box API
- Set up webhook notifications when files arrive
- Automatically move uploaded files to permanent storage
- Trigger Tallyfy API calls when uploads complete

## Managing file request links

Track your active file requests:

1. Visit Box.com and navigate to your folder
2. Check the sharing panel to see active file requests
3. Disable links after the collection period ends
4. Review upload history in Box's admin console

## Best practices

**Folder organization** - Create a clear folder hierarchy that mirrors your process structure.

**Naming conventions** - Use consistent naming like `[Process]-[Date]-[Client]` for easy identification.

**Regular cleanup** - Disable old file request links quarterly to maintain security.

**Monitor usage** - Review Box's audit logs to track who's uploading files.

## Limitations

**Business plan required** - File requests aren't available on personal Box accounts.

**Single folder destination** - Each file request points to one folder (can't split uploads dynamically).

**No conditional logic** - Can't show/hide metadata fields based on previous selections.

## Alternative: Box folder invites

For trusted partners with Box accounts:

1. Create a Box folder
2. Click **Share** and invite collaborators
3. Set permissions to "Uploader" (can only add files)
4. Share the folder link through Tallyfy

This approach provides more features but requires Box accounts.

## Troubleshooting

**"Access denied" errors** - Check if your organization's admin has restricted file requests.

**Missing metadata** - Ensure required fields are configured in the file request settings.

**Upload failures** - Verify file size limits (5 GB default, configurable up to 250 GB).

**Link not working** - Confirm the link is enabled and hasn't expired.

## Cost considerations

Box file requests are included with Business plans but count toward your storage quota. Monitor usage if you're collecting large files regularly.

## Summary

Box file requests excel in enterprise environments where security and compliance matter most. The ability to require authentication, collect metadata, and maintain detailed audit trails makes it ideal for regulated industries. While it requires a paid Box plan, the security features justify the investment for sensitive document workflows.
