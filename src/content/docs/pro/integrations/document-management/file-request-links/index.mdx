## Using file request links for secure document collection

File request links solve a common workflow challenge - collecting documents from people who don't have access to your systems. Whether you're gathering tax documents from clients, medical records from patients, or contracts from vendors, these links provide a secure upload path without compromising your document security.

The beauty lies in simplicity. Your document management system generates a unique link. Anyone with that link can upload files to a designated folder. They don't need an account, don't see other files, and can't access your broader system. Meanwhile, you maintain complete control over document storage, access, and compliance.

## How file request links work with Tallyfy

<Steps>
1. **Generate the link in your DMS**
   
   Navigate to your document management system and create a file request for the specific folder where you want documents stored.

2. **Store the link in Tallyfy**
   
   Copy the generated link and paste it into a short text field in your Tallyfy template. This becomes part of your workflow data.

3. **Share via workflow tasks**
   
   Use [variables](mdc:products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/) to insert the link into task instructions. When someone reaches that task, they see the link and know exactly where to upload.

4. **Collect documents securely**
   
   The recipient clicks the link, uploads their documents directly to your DMS, and marks the Tallyfy task complete. Documents go straight to your secure storage.

5. **Access from your DMS**
   
   Your team retrieves the uploaded documents from the DMS using your existing security protocols and access controls.
</Steps>

## Real-world example

A legal firm uses this approach daily. Here's their workflow:

The firm launches a new client onboarding process in Tallyfy. During launch, they generate unique Box file request links for each document type - contracts, identification documents, financial records. These links get stored in text fields.

When the client receives their tasks, they see clear instructions: "Upload your documents here: [link]". The client clicks, uploads directly to the firm's Box account, and the documents land in the correct client folder. The law firm maintains attorney-client privilege while the client has a smooth experience.

## Setting up your workflow

To implement file request links in your Tallyfy workflows, you need three components:

**Template configuration** - Add short text form fields to capture the file request URLs during process launch.

**Variable insertion** - Use variables to dynamically insert these URLs into task descriptions or form instructions.

**Clear instructions** - Write task descriptions that explain what documents to upload and provide the link prominently.

## Security benefits

File request links provide multiple layers of security:

**No account required** - External users upload without creating accounts or remembering passwords.

**Limited access** - Uploaders can't see, edit, or download existing files in your system.

**Time limits** - Most DMS platforms let you set expiration dates on upload links.

**Audit trails** - Your DMS tracks who uploaded what and when.

**Compliance maintained** - Documents stay within your compliant infrastructure.

## Common use cases

### Legal services
Collecting evidence, contracts, and identification documents from clients while maintaining privilege.

### Healthcare
Gathering medical records, insurance cards, and consent forms from patients per HIPAA requirements.

### Financial services
Obtaining tax documents, bank statements, and investment records for account opening.

### Human resources
Collecting resumes, references, and onboarding paperwork from new hires.

### Real estate
Gathering property documents, inspection reports, and closing paperwork from buyers and sellers.

## Best practices

**Generate unique links** - Create fresh upload links for each process instance to maintain document separation.

**Set expiration dates** - Configure links to expire after a reasonable timeframe to prevent unauthorized late uploads.

**Name folders clearly** - Use consistent folder naming in your DMS that matches your process structure.

**Provide examples** - In your task instructions, specify exactly what documents you need and acceptable formats.

**Test the flow** - Run through the entire process as an external user would to ensure smooth operation.

## Choosing your DMS platform

Different platforms offer varying levels of file request functionality:

<PageTree />

Not all platforms have native file request features. Google Drive, for instance, requires third-party tools to enable anonymous uploads. Consider your platform's capabilities when designing your workflow.

## Automation possibilities

Advanced implementations can automate link generation:

- Use your DMS API to create folders and generate links programmatically
- Trigger link creation through webhooks when processes launch
- Store links automatically in Tallyfy via API
- Send links directly to recipients through automated emails

This removes manual steps but requires technical setup.

## Troubleshooting common issues

**Links not working** - Verify the link hasn't expired and the destination folder still exists.

**Upload failures** - Check file size limits and accepted formats in your DMS settings.

**Access problems** - Ensure your DMS allows anonymous uploads and "Anyone" links are enabled.

**Missing files** - Confirm uploads completed successfully and check the correct folder in your DMS.
