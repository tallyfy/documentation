## What are file request links?

File request links let you collect documents from people who don't have access to your systems. Your document management system (DMS) generates a unique URL. Anyone with that link can upload files to a specific folder - they don't need an account, can't see other files, and can't access anything else. You keep full control over storage, access, and compliance.

## How file request links work with Tallyfy

<Steps>
1. **Generate the link in your DMS**

   Open your document management system and create a file request for the target folder.

2. **Store the link in Tallyfy**

   Paste the generated link into a short text field in your Tallyfy template.

3. **Share via workflow tasks**

   Use [variables](mdc:products/pro/documenting/templates/variables/) to insert the link into task instructions. When someone reaches that task, they'll see the upload link.

4. **Collect documents**

   The recipient clicks the link, uploads files directly to your DMS, and marks the Tallyfy task complete.

5. **Access from your DMS**

   Your team retrieves uploaded documents from the DMS using your existing access controls.
</Steps>

## Real-world example

A legal firm launches a client onboarding process in Tallyfy. During launch, they generate unique Box file request links for each document type - contracts, IDs, financial records - and store them in text fields.

The client receives tasks with clear instructions: "Upload your documents here: [link]". They click, upload directly to the firm's Box account, and documents land in the correct client folder. The firm maintains attorney-client privilege while the client gets a straightforward experience.

## Setting up your workflow

You'll need three things:

**Template configuration** - Add short text form fields to capture file request URLs during process launch.

**Variable insertion** - Use variables to insert these URLs into task descriptions or form instructions.

**Clear instructions** - Write task descriptions that explain what documents to upload and show the link prominently.

## Security benefits

**No account required** - External users upload without creating accounts or remembering passwords.

**Limited access** - Uploaders can't see, edit, or download existing files.

**Time limits** - Most DMS platforms let you set expiration dates on upload links.

**Audit trails** - Your DMS tracks who uploaded what and when.

**Compliance maintained** - Documents stay within your existing infrastructure.

## Common use cases

### Legal services
Collecting evidence, contracts, and IDs from clients while maintaining privilege.

### Healthcare
Gathering medical records, insurance cards, and consent forms per HIPAA requirements.

### Financial services
Obtaining tax documents, bank statements, and investment records for account opening.

### Human resources
Collecting resumes, references, and onboarding paperwork from new hires.

### Real estate
Gathering property documents, inspection reports, and closing paperwork from buyers and sellers.

## Best practices

**Generate unique links** - Create fresh upload links for each process instance to keep documents separated.

**Set expiration dates** - Configure links to expire after a reasonable timeframe.

**Name folders clearly** - Use consistent folder naming in your DMS that matches your process structure.

**Provide examples** - In your task instructions, specify exactly what documents you need and acceptable formats.

**Test the flow** - Run through the entire process as an external user would before going live.

## Choosing your DMS platform

Not every platform handles file requests the same way:

<PageTree />

Some platforms - like Google Drive - don't have native file request features and need third-party tools for anonymous uploads. Check your platform's capabilities before designing your workflow.

## Automation possibilities

You can automate link generation for more advanced setups:

- Use your DMS API to create folders and generate links programmatically
- Trigger link creation through webhooks when processes launch
- Store links automatically in Tallyfy via API
- Send links directly to recipients through automated emails

## Troubleshooting common issues

**Links not working** - Verify the link hasn't expired and the destination folder still exists.

**Upload failures** - Check file size limits and accepted formats in your DMS settings.

**Access problems** - Make sure your DMS allows anonymous uploads and "Anyone" links are enabled.

**Missing files** - Confirm uploads completed successfully and check the correct folder in your DMS.
