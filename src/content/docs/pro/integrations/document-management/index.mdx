## Connect your document management system to Tallyfy

You can connect your existing document management system (DMS) to Tallyfy workflows. Keep your current security protocols and document storage in place - Tallyfy orchestrates the workflow around those documents.

Tallyfy handles the "who does what and when" while your DMS handles "where documents live and how they're secured."

## Choose your document strategy

You've got two paths when handling documents in workflows.

### Use your existing DMS

**Good for:**
- Organizations with strict compliance requirements (HIPAA, SOC 2, GDPR)
- Legal firms handling privileged documents
- Healthcare providers managing patient records
- Financial institutions with regulatory constraints

**Advantages:**
- Documents stay in your secured, compliant environment
- Existing access controls and audit trails remain intact
- No file size limits from Tallyfy
- Keep using DMS features like versioning, encryption, and retention policies

**Trade-offs:**
- Requires initial setup of file request links
- Users interact with two systems

### Use Tallyfy's built-in file management

**Good for:**
- Simple document workflows without special compliance needs
- Teams wanting everything in one place
- Quick implementations without IT involvement

**Advantages:**
- Single system for users to learn
- Files attach directly to tasks
- No integration needed
- Built-in commenting on files

**Trade-offs:**
- 100MB file size limit per upload
- Less granular access controls
- Storage counts toward your Tallyfy plan limits

## The hybrid approach

Many organizations handle sensitive documents through their DMS while using Tallyfy's file uploads for routine attachments like screenshots or simple forms. For example, an HR team might collect employment agreements through secure DMS links but attach interview feedback directly in Tallyfy tasks.

## How file request links work

File request links let external users upload documents directly to your DMS without needing accounts. Here's how it works:

1. Your DMS generates a unique upload link for a specific folder
2. You store this link in a Tallyfy text field
3. The workflow shares the link with the person who needs to upload
4. They click it and upload directly to your DMS
5. Your team accesses documents from the DMS

Documents never pass through Tallyfy - your security boundary stays intact.

## Security considerations

**Data sovereignty** - Documents remain in your controlled environment, which matters for data residency requirements.

**Compliance** - Your existing certifications and controls stay intact.

**Access control** - DMS permissions determine who sees what, independent of Tallyfy access.

**Audit trails** - Document access logs stay in your DMS for compliance reporting.

## Implementation patterns

### Individual file requests

Generate unique upload links for each process instance. Best for collecting sensitive documents from different clients or patients.

### Shared collection folders

Use the same upload link across multiple process runs. Works well for internal document submission where security is less critical.

### Automated link generation

Use your DMS API to automatically generate fresh upload links when launching processes. This requires technical setup but gives the smoothest experience.
