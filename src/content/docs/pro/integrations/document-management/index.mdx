## Integrate document management systems with Tallyfy

You can seamlessly connect your existing document management system (DMS) to Tallyfy workflows. This approach lets you maintain your current security protocols and document storage while using Tallyfy to orchestrate the workflow around those documents.

Think of it this way - Tallyfy handles the "who does what and when" while your DMS handles the "where documents live and how they're secured." It's the best of both worlds.

## Choosing your document strategy

When handling documents in workflows, you've got two paths. Each serves different needs.

### Using your existing DMS

**Perfect for:**
- Organizations with strict compliance requirements (HIPAA, SOC 2, GDPR)
- Legal firms handling privileged documents
- Healthcare providers managing patient records
- Financial institutions with regulatory constraints
- Companies with existing DMS investments

**Key advantages:**
- Documents stay in your secured, compliant environment
- Maintain existing access controls and audit trails
- No file size limitations from Tallyfy
- Use familiar DMS features (versioning, encryption, retention policies)
- Reduced storage costs in Tallyfy

**Trade-offs:**
- Requires initial setup of file request links
- Users interact with two systems
- Additional step to generate unique upload links

### Using Tallyfy's built-in file management

**Perfect for:**
- Simple document workflows without special compliance needs
- Teams wanting everything in one place
- Quick implementations without IT involvement
- Internal processes with trusted users

**Key advantages:**
- Single system for users to learn
- Files attached directly to tasks
- Simpler setup - no integration needed
- Built-in commenting on files
- Automatic file organization by process

**Trade-offs:**
- 250MB file size limit per upload
- Less granular access controls
- Storage counts toward Tallyfy limits
- Limited retention policy options

## The hybrid approach

Many organizations use a hybrid strategy. They handle sensitive documents through their DMS while using Tallyfy's file uploads for routine attachments like screenshots or simple forms.

For instance, an HR team might collect employment agreements through secure DMS links but attach interview feedback directly in Tallyfy tasks.

## How file request links work

File request links let external users upload documents directly to your DMS without needing accounts. Here's the workflow:

1. Your DMS generates a unique upload link for a specific folder
2. You store this link in a Tallyfy text field
3. The workflow shares this link with the person who needs to upload
4. They click the link and upload directly to your DMS
5. Your team accesses the documents from the DMS

The documents never pass through Tallyfy - maintaining your security boundary.

## Security considerations

Using your DMS for document collection provides several security benefits:

**Data sovereignty** - Documents remain in your controlled environment, important for organizations with data residency requirements.

**Compliance maintenance** - Your existing compliance certifications and controls stay intact.

**Access control** - DMS permissions determine who sees what, independent of Tallyfy access.

**Audit trails** - Document access logs remain in your DMS for compliance reporting.

## Implementation patterns

### Pattern 1: Individual file requests

Generate unique upload links for each process instance. Best for collecting sensitive documents from different clients or patients.

### Pattern 2: Shared collection folders

Use the same upload link across multiple process runs. Works well for internal document submission where security is less critical.

### Pattern 3: Automated link generation

Use your DMS API to automatically generate fresh upload links when launching processes. Requires technical setup but provides the smoothest experience.
