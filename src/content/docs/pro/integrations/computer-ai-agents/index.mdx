## How do Computer AI Agents work with Tallyfy?

The automation landscape has dramatically evolved in 2025 with the emergence of production-ready Computer AI Agents that are revolutionizing how businesses approach process automation. Leading platforms like OpenAI Operator, Claude Computer Use, Skyvern, and Twin.so have demonstrated real-world capabilities with enterprise deployments serving hundreds of thousands of users.

Computer AI Agents (also called autonomous agents or computer use agents) are sophisticated software programs that can perceive complex digital environments, make autonomous decisions, and execute intricate tasks through human-like computer interactions including web browsers, applications, and diverse user interfaces.

This revolutionary next-generation automation approach gives you unprecedented flexibility and intelligence in business process execution while maintaining the oversight and control that organizations need.

Tallyfy's philosophy of "Trackable AI" aligns perfectly with the capabilities of these agents. While Computer AI agents provide the "engine" to perform tasks (the "socket"), Tallyfy acts as the crucial "plug." Tallyfy provides the clear, step-by-step instructions, defines the inputs and expected outputs, establishes guardrails, and offers a framework for managing and improving how these AI agents execute tasks within your business processes. This ensures that AI-driven automation remains transparent, accountable, and continuously improvable.

### What capabilities do Computer AI Agents provide?

Computer AI Agents use cutting-edge artificial intelligence including large language models (LLMs) and advanced computer vision technologies to understand and interact smartly with complex computer systems.

Unlike traditional automation that depends on fragile, brittle scripts or limited API integrations, these smart agents deliver sophisticated, adaptive capabilities:

*   **Visual Perception:** Analyze and completely understand complex screen content, including text, images, buttons, forms, and dynamic interface elements.
*   **Smart Reasoning:** Interpret instructions (often given in natural language), plan sophisticated action sequences, and make context-aware decisions to achieve specific goals.
*   **Precise Action:** Control mouse cursors accurately, simulate realistic keyboard input, navigate complex websites, and interact smoothly with various software applications.
*   **Dynamic Adaptation:** Advanced agents learn from interactions and adapt smartly to user interface changes or unexpected situations, making them significantly more resilient than legacy automation methods.

:::warning[Important guidance for AI agent tasks]
Your step-by-step instructions for the AI agent to perform work go into the Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) description. **Start with short, bite-size and easy tasks that are just mundane and tedious.** Do not try and ask an AI agent to do huge, complex decision-driven jobs that are goal-driven - they are prone to indeterministic behavior, hallucination, and it can get very expensive quickly.

### How do Tallyfy and Computer AI Agents work together?

Integrating Tallyfy with Computer AI Agents creates powerful synergy for automating complex, computer-based steps within your documented business processes. This integration delivers complete workflow orchestration:

1.  **Process Documentation in Tallyfy:** Start by completely documenting your business process in Tallyfy, breaking it down into clear, actionable steps. Distinguish between human-performed tasks and candidates for AI automation.
2.  **AI Agent Task Assignment:** For steps involving computer-based actions (like logging into web portals, extracting data from third-party systems, or completing online forms), assign a Computer AI Agent to perform these specific tasks.
3.  **Instruction and Input Provision:** Tallyfy passes detailed instructions for each step (the "goal") and necessary data (inputs from previous Tallyfy tasks or form fields) to the integrated Computer AI Agent.
4.  **Trackable Agent Execution:** The AI agent executes tasks by interacting with relevant computer interfaces. Tallyfy's "Trackable AI" principle lets you monitor agent progress in real-time and log actions, ensuring complete transparency.
5.  **Output Capture and Process Continuation:** When the task is done, the agent returns outputs (extracted data, confirmation numbers, etc.) to Tallyfy, automatically filling form fields in current or subsequent tasks for smooth process continuation.
6.  **Continuous Improvement:** Tallyfy's framework makes it easy to give feedback on AI agent performance, enabling continuous improvement of instructions and guardrails provided to agents.

### What benefits do Computer AI Agents provide with Tallyfy?

*   **Complex Task Automation:** Go beyond simple RPA limitations to automate sophisticated tasks that need interaction with dynamic web pages or applications lacking APIs.
*   **Better Efficiency:** Dramatically reduce manual effort on repetitive computer-based activities while speeding up process execution.
*   **Better Accuracy:** Reduce human errors in data entry, information retrieval, and complex multi-step procedures.
*   **Better Adaptability:** Use smart agents that adapt smoothly to user interface changes, getting rid of the maintenance burden of traditional automation scripts.
*   **Complete Process Orchestration:** Tallyfy orchestrates complete end-to-end processes, enabling smooth task handoffs between human workers and AI agents.
*   **Kept Control and Visibility:** Through Tallyfy's "Trackable AI" approach, organizations keep complete oversight and continuous improvement capabilities for AI-driven steps, ensuring AI serves organizational goals effectively.

This section will explore various Computer AI Agent vendors and delve deeper into how they compare with traditional RPA, helping you understand how to best leverage these technologies within your Tallyfy workflows.
