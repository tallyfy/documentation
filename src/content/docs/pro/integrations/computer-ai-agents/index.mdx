## What are computer AI agents?

Computer AI agents are programs that can see your screen, understand it, and take action. Unlike traditional automation that needs specific API connections, these agents navigate browsers, fill forms, and extract data from any interface by interpreting visual elements.

Think of them as automation that works like a person would - clicking buttons, typing text, reading what's displayed - but without custom code for every app.

For conversational AI that works with text and documents rather than screens, see the [BYO AI integration](/products/pro/integrations/byo-ai/) connecting ChatGPT, Claude, or Copilot.

### How Tallyfy works with AI agents

Tallyfy provides structure around AI agent execution. It gives step-by-step instructions and defines inputs and outputs, while the agent handles screen-based tasks. This separation means you can see what the agent's doing and manage automated steps alongside your broader processes.

### Core capabilities

These agents combine large language models with computer vision to interact with apps through their UI:

- **Visual perception** - Identify and interpret text, buttons, forms, and other screen elements
- **Plain language instructions** - Accept goals in everyday English instead of scripted code
- **Mouse and keyboard control** - Click, type, scroll, and navigate just like a person
- **UI adaptation** - Often handle interface changes that would break traditional RPA scripts

:::warning[Start small]
AI agents work best with straightforward, repetitive tasks - like filling form fields with known values. Complex work requiring judgment can produce inconsistent results and high costs. Start small and expand gradually.

# Computer AI Agent Workflow

# Orchestration Layer
Tallyfy: Tallyfy Task {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#e1f7e6"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.stroke-width: 2
}

# AI Agent
Agent: Computer AI Agent {

}

# Agent Actions
Perceive: Perceive UI {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#f2faf4"
}

Act: Take Action {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#f2faf4"
}

# Decision Point
Verify: Check Result {
  shape: diamond
  style.fill: "#f2faf4"
}

# Completion
Complete: Task Complete {
  shape: circle
  style.fill: "#e1f7e6"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.stroke-width: 2
}

# Main Flow
Tallyfy -> Agent: Send instructions\n+ form data {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.stroke-width: 3
}

Agent -> Perceive: Analyze screen {
  style.stroke: "#225930"

}

Perceive -> Act: Execute steps {

  style.stroke-width: 2
}

# Retry Loop
Verify -> Perceive: Retry if needed {
  style.stroke: "#ffa500"
  style.stroke-dash: 3
  label: "Not done"
}

# Success Path
Verify -> Complete: Task succeeded {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.stroke-width: 2
  label: "Success"
}

Complete -> Tallyfy: Return results\n+ screenshots {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.stroke-width: 3
}

# Error Handling
Error: Error Handler {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#fff3cd"
}

Verify -> Error: Max retries\nexceeded {
  style.stroke: "#ff6b6b"
  style.stroke-dash: 3
}

Error -> Tallyfy: Report failure {
  style.stroke: "#ff6b6b"
  style.stroke-dash: 3
}
```

**Key points:**
- Tallyfy sends structured inputs (instructions, data, criteria) to guide the agent
- The agent loops through perceive-act-verify cycles until the task's done
- Results flow back into the workflow for tracking and next steps

**How it works in practice:**

1. **Map your process** - Identify which steps humans do and which an AI agent could handle
2. **Assign agent tasks** - Web navigation, data extraction, or form filling are good candidates
3. **Send instructions** - Tallyfy passes instructions and data from previous steps to the agent
4. **Monitor execution** - Agent actions get logged for troubleshooting
5. **Capture results** - Outputs return to Tallyfy for the next step
6. **Iterate** - Adjust instructions based on results to improve reliability

### Benefits and limitations

**What you gain:**

- **Wider automation reach** - Works with apps that lack APIs or integration options
- **Less manual work** - Handles repetitive screen tasks that previously needed a person
- **UI resilience** - Can often adapt when interfaces change, though it's not guaranteed
- **Visibility** - When orchestrated through Tallyfy, agent actions get logged and tracked

**What to watch out for:**

- **Reliability varies** - Success rates depend on task complexity, site structure, and the vendor
- **Costs scale quickly** - Many vendors charge per task or by execution time
- **Not deterministic** - Unlike traditional code, agents may behave differently each run
- **Still emerging** - Vendor capabilities, pricing, and availability keep changing
