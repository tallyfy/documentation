## How do Computer AI Agents work with Tallyfy?

The automation landscape rapidly evolves beyond traditional Robotic Process Automation (RPA) toward intelligent, adaptive solutions powered by Computer AI Agents that fundamentally transform business process execution.

Computer AI Agents (also called autonomous agents or computer use agents) represent sophisticated software programs capable of perceiving complex digital environments, making autonomous decisions, and executing intricate tasks through human-like computer interactions including web browsers, applications, and diverse user interfaces.

This revolutionary next-generation automation approach enables unprecedented flexibility and intelligence in business process execution while maintaining the oversight and control that organizations require.

Tallyfy's philosophy of "Trackable AI" aligns perfectly with the capabilities of these agents. While Computer AI agents provide the "engine" to perform tasks (the "socket"), Tallyfy acts as the crucial "plug." Tallyfy provides the clear, step-by-step instructions, defines the inputs and expected outputs, establishes guardrails, and offers a framework for managing and improving how these AI agents execute tasks within your business processes. This ensures that AI-driven automation remains transparent, accountable, and continuously improvable.

### What capabilities do Computer AI Agents provide?

Computer AI Agents leverage cutting-edge artificial intelligence including large language models (LLMs) and advanced computer vision technologies to understand and interact intelligently with complex computer systems.

Unlike traditional automation dependent on fragile, brittle scripts or limited API integrations, these intelligent agents deliver sophisticated, adaptive capabilities:

*   **Visual Perception:** Analyze and comprehensively understand complex screen content, including text, images, buttons, forms, and dynamic interface elements.
*   **Intelligent Reasoning:** Interpret instructions (often provided in natural language), plan sophisticated action sequences, and make context-aware decisions to achieve specific goals.
*   **Precise Action:** Control mouse cursors accurately, simulate realistic keyboard input, navigate complex websites, and interact seamlessly with various software applications.
*   **Dynamic Adaptation:** Advanced agents learn from interactions and adapt intelligently to user interface changes or unexpected situations, making them significantly more resilient than legacy automation methods.

:::warning[Important guidance for AI agent tasks]
Your step-by-step instructions for the AI agent to perform work go into the Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) description. **Start with short, bite-size and easy tasks that are just mundane and tedious.** Do not try and ask an AI agent to do huge, complex decision-driven jobs that are goal-driven - they are prone to indeterministic behavior, hallucination, and it can get very expensive quickly.

### How do Tallyfy and Computer AI Agents work together?

Integrating Tallyfy with Computer AI Agents creates a powerful synergy for automating complex, computer-based steps within your documented business processes. This integration delivers comprehensive workflow orchestration:

1.  **Process Documentation in Tallyfy:** Begin by comprehensively documenting your business process in Tallyfy, breaking it down into clear, actionable steps. Distinguish between human-performed tasks and candidates for AI automation.
2.  **AI Agent Task Assignment:** For steps involving computer-based actions (such as logging into web portals, extracting data from third-party systems, or completing online forms), designate a Computer AI Agent to perform these specific tasks.
3.  **Instruction and Input Provision:** Tallyfy passes detailed instructions for each step (the "goal") and necessary data (inputs from previous Tallyfy tasks or form fields) to the integrated Computer AI Agent.
4.  **Trackable Agent Execution:** The AI agent executes tasks by interacting with relevant computer interfaces. Tallyfy's "Trackable AI" principle enables real-time monitoring of agent progress and action logging, ensuring complete transparency.
5.  **Output Capture and Process Continuation:** Upon task completion, the agent returns outputs (extracted data, confirmation numbers, etc.) to Tallyfy, automatically populating form fields in current or subsequent tasks for seamless process continuation.
6.  **Continuous Improvement:** Tallyfy's framework facilitates feedback on AI agent performance, enabling continuous improvement of instructions and guardrails provided to agents.

### What benefits do Computer AI Agents provide with Tallyfy?

*   **Complex Task Automation:** Transcend simple RPA limitations to automate sophisticated tasks requiring interaction with dynamic web pages or applications lacking APIs.
*   **Operational Efficiency:** Dramatically reduce manual effort on repetitive computer-based activities while accelerating process execution.
*   **Enhanced Accuracy:** Minimize human errors in data entry, information retrieval, and complex multi-step procedures.
*   **Superior Adaptability:** Leverage intelligent agents that adapt seamlessly to user interface changes, eliminating the maintenance burden of traditional automation scripts.
*   **Comprehensive Process Orchestration:** Tallyfy orchestrates complete end-to-end processes, enabling seamless task handoffs between human workers and AI agents.
*   **Maintained Control and Visibility:** Through Tallyfy's "Trackable AI" approach, organizations retain complete oversight and continuous improvement capabilities for AI-driven steps, ensuring AI serves organizational goals effectively.

This section will explore various Computer AI Agent vendors and delve deeper into how they compare with traditional RPA, helping you understand how to best leverage these technologies within your Tallyfy workflows.
