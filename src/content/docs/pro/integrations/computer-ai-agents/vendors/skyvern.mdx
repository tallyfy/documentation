## Browser automation with Skyvern

Skyvern automates browser workflows using LLMs and computer vision. It's open source (AGPL-3.0 license) and performs well on the WebVoyager benchmark. Unlike traditional RPA scripts that break when websites change, Skyvern adapts in real-time by visually understanding page layouts.

:::warning[Important guidance for AI agent tasks]
Your step-by-step instructions for the AI agent go into the Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) description. **Start with short, easy tasks that are mundane and tedious.** Don't ask an AI agent to handle huge, decision-driven jobs - they're prone to unpredictable behavior, hallucination, and costs can spiral quickly.

### Integration with Tallyfy

You can connect Skyvern to Tallyfy through webhooks or middleware platforms (Zapier, Make, n8n). The flow works like this: Tallyfy triggers the automation, Skyvern runs the browser workflow, and structured data comes back to Tallyfy.

**What you get:**
- **Three-agent setup** - Planner decides goals, Actor executes actions, Validator confirms success
- **Self-correcting behavior** - Failed tasks trigger automatic retries with different approaches
- **Structured output** - Returns JSON or CSV data that maps to Tallyfy form fields

### Key capabilities

**Deployment options:**
- **Open source** - Self-host under AGPL-3.0 with full source access
- **Cloud** - Managed service at app.skyvern.com with anti-bot measures, proxies, and CAPTCHA solving

**Technical foundation:**
- Multiple LLM providers: OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, Ollama, OpenRouter, Gemini, Novita AI
- Python 3.11-3.13 compatibility
- Playwright for browser automation
- Real-time visual parsing

**Advanced features:**
- CAPTCHA solving and 2FA (QR codes, email, SMS)
- Proxy networks for geo-targeting
- Livestream browser viewport for debugging
- File downloads and uploads
- Credit card form filling

**Pricing:**
- Cloud: Pay-per-step model (check current rates at skyvern.com)
- Free tier with starter credit
- Self-hosted: Free (you cover infrastructure and LLM API costs)

### Multi-agent architecture

Skyvern splits work across three core agents:

- **Planner** - Sets goals, tracks progress, breaks tasks into sub-goals
- **Actor** - Executes browser actions for specific goals and reports status
- **Validator** - Checks if goals succeeded, triggers retries when they don't

These are backed by specialized sub-agents:
- **Interactable Element Agent** - Identifies buttons, forms, and links in HTML
- **Navigation Agent** - Plans action sequences to reach goals
- **Data Extraction Agent** - Structures webpage data into JSON or CSV
- **Password Agent** - Handles logins with password manager integration
- **2FA Agent** - Manages authentication prompts
- **Auto-complete Agent** - Handles form fields like address lookups

### Getting started

<Steps>

1. **Pick a deployment:**
   - **Skyvern Cloud** - Visit app.skyvern.com for managed service with free starter credit
   - **Self-hosted** - Clone from github.com/Skyvern-AI/skyvern (needs Python 3.11+ or Docker)

2. **Self-hosting setup (if chosen):**
   - **Local install:** Run `pip install skyvern`, then `skyvern init` to configure
   - **Docker:** Clone the repo, set LLM API keys in `docker-compose.yml`, run `docker compose up -d`
   - Access the UI at `http://localhost:8080`

3. **Configure your LLM provider:**
   - Add API keys for your chosen provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, Ollama, OpenRouter, Gemini, Novita AI)

4. **Define your first task:**
   - Set the `url` (starting page)
   - Write a `prompt` in plain language describing what you want done
   - Optionally add `data_schema` for structured extraction (JSON/CSV)
   - Optionally define `error_codes` for when to stop

5. **Run and monitor:**
   - Launch tasks via UI or API
   - Use the livestream feature to watch the browser in real-time

</Steps>

### Real-world use cases

Skyvern's documentation highlights these production scenarios:

**Invoice management** - Log into vendor portals, download statements, rename and organize files automatically.

**Job applications** - Apply across multiple platforms, fill forms with candidate info, upload resumes.

**Government compliance** - Submit forms to state and federal portals, handle multi-step 2FA flows, upload documents.

**E-commerce** - Purchase from hundreds of sites, extract competitor pricing, post listings across platforms.

**IT operations** - Employee onboarding/offboarding, system access provisioning, credential management.

### What sets Skyvern apart

**Resilient to website changes** - Traditional RPA breaks when sites redesign. Skyvern uses visual understanding to adapt - no XPath selectors to maintain.

**Open source** - Self-host and customize without vendor lock-in under the AGPL-3.0 license.

**Handles web complexity** - CAPTCHA solving, 2FA, proxy networks, and credit card processing all work out of the box.

**Scalable** - The API-driven design supports thousands of parallel automation tasks.

### Important considerations

**Prompt quality matters** - Vague instructions lead to failed tasks. Write clear, specific prompts.

**Self-hosting needs resources** - Browser automation with LLMs eats CPU and RAM. Budget for infrastructure costs on top of the free software.

**AGPL-3.0 license implications** - If you modify Skyvern and offer it as a public service, you must share your source code changes.

**Website defenses** - Even with anti-bot measures, aggressive automation can trigger rate limits. The cloud version includes proxy networks to help.

**Task complexity** - Break multi-step workflows into smaller pieces. Test incrementally to find failure points early.
