## Browser automation with Skyvern

Skyvern automates browser workflows using LLMs and computer vision. It's open source (AGPL-3.0 license) and scored 85.8% on the WebVoyager benchmark - currently best-in-class for AI browser agents. Unlike traditional RPA scripts that break when websites change, Skyvern adapts in real-time using visual understanding.

:::warning[Important guidance for AI agent tasks]
Your step-by-step instructions for the AI agent to perform work go into the Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) description. **Start with short, bite-size and easy tasks that are just mundane and tedious.** Do not try and ask an AI agent to do huge, complex decision-driven jobs that are goal-driven - they are prone to indeterministic behavior, hallucination, and it can get very expensive quickly.

### Integration possibilities with Tallyfy

Skyvern can be integrated with Tallyfy through webhooks or middleware platforms (Zapier, Make, n8n) to automate browser-based tasks. The integration follows this pattern: Tallyfy triggers the automation request, Skyvern executes the browser workflow, and returns structured data back to Tallyfy.

**What you get:**
- **Three-agent architecture** - Planner decides goals, Actor executes actions, Validator confirms success
- **Self-correcting behavior** - Failed tasks trigger automatic retries with different approaches
- **Structured output** - Returns JSON or CSV data that maps to Tallyfy form fields

### Key capabilities

**Deployment options:**
- **Open source** - Self-host under AGPL-3.0 license with full source code access
- **Cloud** - Managed service at app.skyvern.com with anti-bot measures, proxies, and CAPTCHA solving

**Performance:**
- Scored 85.8% on WebVoyager benchmark (tested on 5,750 tasks across 452 websites)
- Outperformed Google Mariner and other commercial solutions
- Skyvern 1.0 scored 45% on the same benchmark before the multi-agent architecture

**Technical foundation:**
- Supports multiple LLM providers: OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, Ollama, OpenRouter, Gemini, Novita AI
- Python 3.11-3.13 compatibility
- Uses Playwright for browser automation
- Real-time visual parsing with computer vision

**Advanced features:**
- CAPTCHA solving and 2FA authentication (QR codes, email, SMS)
- Enterprise proxy networks for geo-targeting
- Livestream browser viewport for debugging
- File downloads and uploads
- Credit card form filling

**Pricing (as of January 2025):**
- Cloud: $0.05 per step (reduced from $0.10)
- Free tier available with $5 credit
- Self-hosted: Free (you pay for infrastructure and LLM API costs)

### Multi-agent architecture

Skyvern 2.0's performance improvement (from 45% to 85.8%) came from splitting work across specialized agents:

**Planner Agent**
- Sets goals based on the overall objective
- Maintains working memory of progress
- Breaks complex tasks into sub-goals

**Actor Agent**
- Executes specific actions for narrowly scoped goals
- Reports completion status and issues
- Handles browser interactions and element identification

**Validator Agent**
- Checks if goals were achieved successfully
- Provides feedback to Planner and Actor
- Triggers retries when tasks fail

**Specialized sub-agents:**
- **Interactable Element Agent** - Identifies buttons, forms, links in HTML
- **Navigation Agent** - Plans action sequences to reach goals
- **Data Extraction Agent** - Structures webpage data into JSON or CSV
- **Password Agent** - Handles login forms with password manager integration
- **2FA Agent** - Manages authentication prompts during login
- **Auto-complete Agent** - Handles complex form fields like address lookups

### Getting started

<Steps>

1. **Choose deployment:**
   - **Skyvern Cloud** - Visit app.skyvern.com for managed service ($0.05 per step, $5 free credit)
   - **Self-hosted** - Clone from github.com/Skyvern-AI/skyvern (requires Python 3.11-3.13 or Docker)

2. **Self-hosting setup (if chosen):**
   - **Local install:** Run `pip install skyvern`, then `skyvern init` to configure
   - **Docker:** Clone repository, configure `docker-compose.yml` with LLM API keys, run `docker compose up -d`
   - Access UI at `http://localhost:8080`

3. **Configure LLM provider:**
   - Add API keys for your chosen provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, Ollama, OpenRouter, Gemini, Novita AI)

4. **Define your first task:**
   - Specify `url` (starting URL)
   - Write `prompt` in natural language describing the goal
   - Optional: Add `data_schema` for structured extraction (JSON/CSV format)
   - Optional: Define `error_codes` for when to stop

5. **Execute and monitor:**
   - Run tasks via UI or API
   - Use livestream feature to watch the browser in real-time

</Steps>

### Real-world use cases

According to Skyvern's documentation, production deployments handle these scenarios:

**Invoice management:**
- Automated login to multiple vendor portals
- Download monthly statements and invoices
- Rename, organize, and store files automatically

**Job applications:**
- Apply to job postings across multiple platforms
- Fill application forms with candidate information
- Upload resumes and cover letters

**Government compliance:**
- Submit forms to state and federal portals
- Handle multi-step flows with 2FA
- Upload documents and confirm receipt

**E-commerce operations:**
- Purchase items from hundreds of different websites
- Extract competitor pricing data
- Post listings across multiple platforms

**IT operations:**
- Employee onboarding and offboarding workflows
- System access provisioning
- Credential management across tools

### Why Skyvern stands out

**Resilient to website changes:**
Traditional RPA scripts break when websites redesign. Skyvern uses visual understanding to adapt automatically - no XPath selectors to maintain.

**Open source flexibility:**
Self-host and customize without vendor lock-in. AGPL-3.0 license provides full source access.

**Handles web complexity:**
CAPTCHA solving, 2FA authentication, proxy networks for geo-targeting, and credit card processing work out of the box.

**Proven performance:**
85.8% accuracy on WebVoyager benchmark across 5,750 real-world tasks - currently best-in-class for AI browser agents.

**Scalable infrastructure:**
API-driven design supports running thousands of parallel automation tasks through cloud or self-hosted deployments.

### Important considerations

**Prompt quality matters:**
Vague instructions lead to failed tasks. Clear, specific prompts are essential for reliable automation.

**Self-hosting requirements:**
Running browser automation with LLMs requires significant CPU and RAM. Budget for infrastructure costs beyond the free software.

**AGPL-3.0 license implications:**
If you modify Skyvern and offer it as a public service, you must share your source code changes.

**Website defenses exist:**
Even with Skyvern's anti-bot measures, aggressive automation can trigger rate limits. The cloud version includes proxy networks to help.

**Task complexity limits:**
Break down complex multi-step workflows carefully. Test incrementally to identify failure points early.
