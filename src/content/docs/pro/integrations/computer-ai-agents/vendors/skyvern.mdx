## Automating Browser Tasks with Skyvern and Tallyfy

Skyvern is an open-source platform (AGPL-3.0 license) designed to automate browser-based workflows using Large Language Models (LLMs) and computer vision. Its ability to understand and interact with web pages based on natural language prompts makes it a versatile tool for automating tasks within Tallyfy processes that involve web interactions.

:::warning[Important guidance for AI agent tasks]
Your step-by-step instructions for the AI agent to perform work go into the Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) description. **Start with short, bite-size and easy tasks that are just mundane and tedious.** Do not try and ask an AI agent to do huge, complex decision-driven jobs that are goal-driven - they are prone to indeterministic behavior, hallucination, and it can get very expensive quickly.

### Understanding Skyvern AI Agents

Skyvern aims to replace brittle automation scripts by enabling AI agents to parse items in a browser's viewport in real-time, create an interaction plan, and execute it. It is designed to work even on websites it hasn't encountered before and to be resilient to website layout changes.

Key aspects of Skyvern include:

*   **Open Source with Cloud Option:** The core Skyvern logic is open-source (AGPL-3.0), allowing for self-hosting. They also offer a managed cloud version (`app.skyvern.com`) with additional features like anti-bot measures, proxy networks, and CAPTCHA solvers.
*   **LLM and Computer Vision Powered:** Skyvern uses LLMs (supporting models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, AWS Bedrock) to reason through interactions and computer vision to understand on-screen elements. It uses browser automation libraries like Playwright for actual interaction.
*   **Advanced Features:** Supports CAPTCHA solving, 2FA/TOTP (QR-based, email, SMS), proxy networks for geo-targeting, and provides explainable AI through run summaries and livestreaming of the browser viewport.
*   **API-Driven:** Facilitates running numerous automation tasks concurrently.

### How Skyvern Works: A Swarm of Specialized Agents

Skyvern employs a multi-agent system, a "swarm of agents," where each sub-agent has a specific role in comprehending a website, planning, and executing actions. This architecture allows for specialized handling of different aspects of web interaction:

1.  **Interactable Element Agent:** Parses the HTML of a website to identify and extract all elements a user can interact with (buttons, forms, links, etc.).
2.  **Navigation Agent:** Responsible for planning the sequence of actions (e.g., clicks, text input, selections from dropdowns) needed to navigate the website and progress towards the given goal.
3.  **Data Extraction Agent:** Focuses on extracting specific data from a webpage. It can read tables, text, and other content, then structure this information into a user-defined format like JSON or CSV. This is crucial for bringing information back into Tallyfy.
4.  **Password Agent:** Securely handles login forms. It can integrate with password managers (Bitwarden, 1Password, LastPass) to retrieve credentials and fill them into login fields, respecting user privacy.
5.  **2FA Agent:** Manages two-factor authentication prompts during login. It can intercept 2FA requests and either use user-defined APIs for 2FA codes or pause and wait for a user to manually input the code.
6.  **Dynamic Auto-complete Agent:** Specifically designed to handle dynamic auto-complete form fields, such as address lookups or selecting from long, searchable dropdown lists (e.g., university names).

Skyvern 2.0 further enhanced this with a planner and validator agent architecture, improving its ability to handle complex tasks with zero-shot (no pre-training for the specific site) prompts.

### Getting Started with Skyvern

Skyvern offers both a managed cloud service and a self-hosted open-source option.

<Steps>

1.  **Choose Your Deployment Model:**
    *   **Skyvern Cloud:** Navigate to `app.skyvern.com`, create an account. This is the quickest way to start and includes managed infrastructure for anti-bot measures, proxies, and CAPTCHA solving.
    *   **Self-Hosted (Local/Docker):** If you prefer control over the environment or want to leverage the open-source aspect fully.

2.  **Self-Hosting Skyvern (if chosen):**
    *   **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Python 3.11. For Docker, ensure Docker Desktop is running.
    *   **Local Install:**
        1.  Install Skyvern: `pip install skyvern`
        2.  Configure: Run `skyvern init`. This creates a `.env` file for your LLM API keys and other settings.
        3.  Launch Server: `skyvern run server`
        4.  Launch UI: `skyvern run ui` (access at `http://localhost:8080`)
    *   **Docker Compose Setup:**
        1.  Clone the Skyvern GitHub repository: `git clone https://github.com/Skyvern-AI/skyvern.git`
        2.  Navigate to the cloned directory.
        3.  Configure `docker-compose.yml` with your LLM provider API key(s).
        4.  Run: `docker compose up -d`
        5.  Access UI: `http://localhost:8080`

3.  **Configure LLM Providers:**
    *   Skyvern supports LLMs from OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, and AWS Bedrock. You'll need to provide API keys for your chosen LLM provider(s) in the environment variables (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) as specified in the Skyvern documentation.

4.  **Define Your First Task or Workflow:**
    *   **Tasks:** A single request to Skyvern. You need to specify:
        *   `url`: The starting URL for the task.
        *   `prompt`: A natural language instruction detailing the goal.
        *   `data_schema` (optional): A JSONC formatted schema if you want Skyvern to extract data in a specific structure.
        *   `error_codes` (optional): To define specific situations where Skyvern should stop.
    *   **Workflows (Beta):** For more complex operations, you can chain multiple tasks. Supported workflow features include navigation, actions, data extraction, loops, file parsing, sending emails, and text prompts.

5.  **Execute and Monitor:**
    *   Use the Skyvern UI or API to initiate tasks. You can often livestream the browser's viewport to see the agent in action, which is helpful for debugging.

### How Tallyfy Integrates with Skyvern (Example Scenario)

Integrating Tallyfy with Skyvern allows you to delegate browser automation steps from your Tallyfy processes.

**Tallyfy Task:** "Extract Competitor Pricing for Product X"

*   **Inputs from Tallyfy [Form Fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/):**
    *   `Competitor Site URL`: `https://competitor-store.com/products/comparable-to-x`
    *   `Product Name on Competitor Site`: "MegaWidget Advanced"
    *   `Data Schema (JSONC)`:
        ```jsonc
        {
          "product_name": "string", // Should match 'MegaWidget Advanced'
          "price": "string",
          "stock_status": "string"
        }
        ```
*   **Integration Steps (Conceptual - API route):**
    1.  When the Tallyfy task starts, a webhook or middleware calls the Skyvern API's endpoint for creating/running a task.
    2.  The API request to Skyvern includes:
        *   `url`: `https://competitor-store.com/products/comparable-to-x` (from Tallyfy)
        *   `prompt`: "Navigate to the product page. Find the product named 'MegaWidget Advanced'. Extract its current price and stock status. If the product is not found, indicate 'Product not found'."
        *   `data_schema`: The JSONC schema defined above (from Tallyfy).
    3.  Skyvern's Navigation Agent locates the product, and the Data Extraction Agent extracts the price and stock status according to the schema.
    4.  The Tallyfy integration layer polls Skyvern for task completion.
    5.  Once complete, Skyvern returns the structured JSON output (e.g., `{"product_name": "MegaWidget Advanced", "price": "$99.99", "stock_status": "In Stock"}`).
    6.  This JSON data is parsed, and the relevant values are used to update designated Tallyfy form fields (e.g., 'Competitor Price', 'Competitor Stock Status'). The Tallyfy [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) then moves to the next step.

### Benefits

*   **Flexibility of Open Source:** Option to self-host, customize, and avoid vendor lock-in for the core agent platform.
*   **Resilience to UI Changes:** Designed to be more robust against website updates than traditional RPA due to its reliance on visual understanding and LLM-based reasoning over brittle selectors.
*   **Handles Complex Web Elements:** Features like CAPTCHA solving and 2FA support extend automation reach to more challenging websites.
*   **Structured Data Output:** Directly extract data into usable JSON or CSV formats for easy consumption by Tallyfy and subsequent process steps.
*   **Scalable Automation:** The API-driven nature allows for parallel execution of many browser tasks.

### Potential Considerations

*   **Prompt Engineering:** The effectiveness of Skyvern heavily relies on well-crafted prompts for tasks and workflows. Ambiguous or poorly defined goals can lead to a higher likelihood of the LLM hallucinating or the agent failing.
*   **Resource Requirements for Self-Hosting:** Running LLMs and browser automation locally can be resource-intensive (CPU, RAM, GPU if using local vision models). Ensure your self-hosting environment is adequately provisioned.
*   **Complexity of Advanced Features:** While features like Workflows (Beta), Authentication, and 2FA are powerful, they may require more technical expertise to set up and troubleshoot correctly, especially in a self-hosted environment.
*   **AGPL-3.0 License:** If you modify the open-source code and use it in a publicly accessible service, the AGPL-3.0 license has specific requirements regarding making your modifications available, which businesses should review.
*   **Rate Limits and Anti-Bot Measures:** Even with advanced agents, very frequent or rapid interactions can trigger anti-bot defenses on websites. The Skyvern Cloud offering aims to mitigate some of this with managed proxies and anti-bot measures, which might be a consideration for heavy usage.
*   **Debugging:** While livestreaming helps, debugging issues in a multi-agent system that relies on LLM reasoning can sometimes be complex if an unexpected behavior occurs.

By combining Tallyfy for process orchestration with Skyvern for intelligent browser automation, businesses can tackle a wider array of automation challenges, particularly those involving dynamic or complex web interfaces, with the added flexibility of an open-source core.
