## Using Claude to complete tasks within Tallyfy

Claude can control computers by looking at screens, moving cursors, clicking buttons, and typing text. This "Computer Use" capability launched in October 2024 as a public beta, available through Anthropic's API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud Vertex AI.

:::warning[Start small with AI agent tasks]
Put your step-by-step instructions in the Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) description. **Start with short, mundane tasks.** Don't ask an AI agent to handle huge, decision-driven jobs - they're prone to unpredictable behavior and hallucination, and costs add up fast.
:::

:::info[Computer Use vs MCP integration]
This article covers **Claude Computer Use** - where Claude sees and controls screens through screenshots, mouse movements, and keyboard actions. That's different from [Claude's MCP integration](/products/pro/integrations/mcp-server/claude-anthropic/), which gives text-based chat access to data sources and APIs.

**When to use each:**
- **Computer Use** (this article): Automating visual UI tasks - clicking buttons, filling forms, working through menus
- **MCP Integration**: Data queries, API-based workflow management, text-based automation

Both can complement each other in automation workflows.
:::

### How computer use works

Rather than building thousands of app-specific integrations, Anthropic gave Claude general computer skills. Claude uses an API to see and interact with any application inside a sandboxed environment.

```d2
direction: right

Task: "Tallyfy Task\n(Instructions)" {
  shape: circle
  style.fill: "#e1f7e6"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.stroke-width: 2
}

Claude: "Claude Agent" {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#8b5cf6"
  style.font-color: "#fff"
}

Loop: "Perception-Action\nLoop" {
  shape: hexagon
  style.fill: "#fff3cd"
}

Output: "Tallyfy Output\n(Results)" {
  shape: circle
  style.fill: "#e1f7e6"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.stroke-width: 2
}

Task -> Claude: "1. Send task\ndescription" {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.stroke-width: 2
}

Claude -> Loop: "2. Request\nscreenshot" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
}

Loop -> Loop: "3. Take screenshot\n4. Analyze UI\n5. Click/Type\n6. Check result" {
  style.stroke: "#666"
  style.stroke-dash: 3
}

Loop -> Claude: "7. Return\nresult" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
  style.stroke-dash: 3
}

Claude -> Output: "8. Task\ncomplete" {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.stroke-width: 2
}

Claude -> Loop: "Repeat until done" {
  style.stroke: "#666"
  style.stroke-dash: 5
}
```

**What to notice:**
- Tallyfy provides the task description and expected outputs that guide Claude's actions
- Claude loops through screenshot-analyze-act cycles until the task is done
- Results, logs, and screenshots get captured back into Tallyfy fields

### Model support and performance

**Models with computer use support:**
- **Claude Sonnet 4.6** - Best balance of performance and cost for most automation
- **Claude Opus 4.6** - Flagship model for the most demanding tasks
- **Claude Haiku 4.5** - Lighter option for simpler, faster automation

**Performance benchmarks (OSWorld):**
- Sonnet 4.6 scores 72.5% - now matching human-level performance (72.4%)
- Rapid improvement from earlier models (Sonnet 4.5 scored 61.4%)
- Still experimental, so expect some errors on tricky UI interactions

### The agent loop

Here's how Tallyfy coordinates Claude's computer use through an iterative loop - Claude perceives, acts, and gets feedback until your task is done.

```d2
direction: down

Tallyfy: "Tallyfy" {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#e1f7e6"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

App: "Your App\n(Orchestrator)" {
  shape: hexagon
  style.fill: "#fff3cd"
}

Claude: "Claude API" {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#8b5cf6"
  style.font-color: "#fff"
}

Sandbox: "Docker Sandbox\n(Isolated Environment)" {
  shape: cylinder
  style.fill: "#e6f3ff"
}

Tallyfy -> App: "1. Webhook with\ntask data" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
  style.stroke-width: 2
}

App -> Claude: "2. Send prompt +\ncomputer tools" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
}

Claude -> App: "3. Tool use\nrequest" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
  style.stroke-dash: 3
}

App -> Sandbox: "4. Execute tool\n(screenshot/click)" {
  style.stroke: "#666"
}

Sandbox -> App: "5. Return\nresult" {
  style.stroke: "#666"
  style.stroke-dash: 3
}

App -> Claude: "6. Send tool\nresult" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
}

Claude -> Claude: "7. Analyze &\ndecide next" {
  style.stroke: "#666"
  style.stroke-dash: 3
}

Claude -> App: "8. Final response\nor next tool" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
  style.stroke-dash: 3
}

App -> Tallyfy: "9. Update task\nwith results" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
  style.stroke-width: 2
}
```

**What to notice:**
- Tallyfy triggers your intermediary app via webhook with task data
- The loop between Claude and the sandbox continues until the task is done
- All tool execution happens in an isolated sandbox for security

### Core components

**Sandboxed environment:** The Docker container typically includes:
- A virtual X11 display server (like Xvfb) for rendering the desktop
- A lightweight Linux desktop environment
- Pre-installed apps (Firefox, LibreOffice, text editors)
- Your implementations of Anthropic's defined tools

**Three core tools** (Anthropic-defined, you execute them):
- **computer**: Mouse/keyboard actions (clicks, typing, scrolling, cursor movement) and taking screenshots
- **text_editor**: View, create, and edit files
- **bash**: Run shell commands in the sandbox

### Pricing

**API pricing (verify current rates at [Anthropic's pricing page](https://docs.anthropic.com)):**
- **Claude Sonnet 4.6**: $3 per million input tokens, $15 per million output tokens
- **Claude Haiku 4.5**: $1 per million input tokens, $5 per million output tokens
- Computer use adds extra tokens to each system prompt

**Access requirements:**
- Anthropic API key with sufficient credits
- Available through Anthropic API, Amazon Bedrock, or Google Cloud Vertex AI
- Docker needed for the reference implementation

### Real-world use cases

Computer Use works well for specific automation scenarios. Early adopters include Asana, Canva, Replit, and DoorDash.

**Good applications:**
- Form filling across desktop apps
- Extracting data from legacy systems without APIs
- QA testing with synthetic test case generation
- Multi-step workflows spanning multiple applications
- Desktop file management tasks

### Current limitations

Claude's computer use is still developing. Anthropic acknowledges these constraints:

**Technical:**
- **Latency**: Tasks with dozens or hundreds of steps can be slow
- **Error-prone**: Scrolling, dragging, and zooming remain challenging
- **Resolution**: May struggle above 1024x768 or 1280x800 due to image scaling
- **Reliability**: Some actions people do effortlessly are still hard for Claude

**Safety:**
- Claude may follow instructions found on-screen, even if they conflict with yours
- Risk of prompt injection from webpages or images
- Potential for misuse if not properly isolated

**Rate limits:**
- API rate limits apply based on your tier
- Processing time varies with task complexity

### Getting started

You'll need to build an intermediary app that connects Tallyfy to the Anthropic API. Anthropic provides a reference implementation with Docker.

<Steps>

1. **Get Anthropic API access:**
   - Get an API key from the Anthropic Console
   - Review the API docs on "Tool Use" and "Computer Use"

2. **Install Docker:**
   - Install the latest version of Docker
   - Required for the sandboxed environment

3. **Pull the reference implementation:**
   - Anthropic provides a Docker-based reference implementation with containerized environment, tool implementations, and agent loop
   - Pull: `docker pull ghcr.io/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts:computer-use-demo-latest`

4. **Configure the environment:**
   - Run the Docker container with proper security settings
   - Container runs with minimal privileges (1 CPU, 2GB RAM default)
   - Access the interface at `http://localhost:8080`
   - Never run Computer Use unattended - always monitor

5. **Build the intermediary app:**
   - Receive webhook requests from Tallyfy
   - Build prompts and tool lists for the Claude API
   - Manage the agent loop between Claude and your sandbox
   - Send results back to Tallyfy

6. **Prompt tips:**
   - Keep tasks simple and well-defined
   - Tell Claude to verify outcomes with screenshots after each step
   - Suggest keyboard shortcuts for tricky UI elements
   - Provide examples of successful interactions when you have them

</Steps>

### Basic integration example

A simplified example of the integration flow:

```python
from anthropic import Anthropic
import os

client = Anthropic(api_key=os.environ['ANTHROPIC_API_KEY'])

# Basic computer use request
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-6-20260220",
    max_tokens=1024,
    tools=[
        {
            "type": "computer_20250124",
            "name": "computer",
            "display_width_px": 1024,
            "display_height_px": 768,
        },
        {
            "type": "text_editor_20250124",
            "name": "text_editor",
        },
        {
            "type": "bash_20250124",
            "name": "bash",
        }
    ],
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Open the file manager and navigate to Documents folder"
        }
    ]
)

# Handle tool use requests in the response
# Execute tools in your sandbox
# Return results to Claude
# Continue loop until task complete
```

**Note**: This is simplified. Real implementations need full agent loop handling, tool execution in a Docker sandbox, and result processing.

### Security best practices

**Key measures:**
- Run Computer Use in a dedicated container or VM with minimal privileges
- Limit internet access to approved domains only
- Never give access to sensitive data or credentials
- Keep Claude isolated from production systems
- Require human confirmation for critical actions
- Enable audit logging

**Known risks:**
- Prompt injection - Claude may follow on-screen instructions
- Code execution risks if not properly sandboxed
- Information theft if given access to sensitive data

### When to use it

**Good fit:**
- Desktop app automation (Excel, legacy software)
- Data extraction from systems without APIs
- Automated testing of desktop apps
- Form filling across multiple apps
- Low-risk, repetitive UI tasks

**Poor fit:**
- Real-time or time-critical operations
- Tasks needing creative judgment
- Social media content creation (restricted by Anthropic)
- High-security environments without proper isolation

**Tips for success:**
- Start simple and well-defined
- Set strong security boundaries
- Monitor closely and keep humans in the loop
- Test with low-risk data first

### Compared to alternatives

**Advantages:**
- Works with any desktop or web app
- No app-specific APIs or integrations needed
- Adapts when UIs change

**Disadvantages:**
- Slower than traditional RPA for simple tasks
- Still experimental with some error-prone execution
- Requires Docker and sandbox infrastructure
- Higher latency than direct API calls

**Alternatives to consider:**
- Traditional RPA for stable, high-volume workflows
- Direct API integrations when available
- Browser-only automation tools for web tasks
