## Using Anthropic's Claude to complete tasks within Tallyfy

Claude can now control computers just like you do - clicking buttons, typing text, and navigating through applications. This "Computer Use" capability works with Claude 4 (Opus and Sonnet), Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2. It's perfect for automating those repetitive UI tasks that eat up your day.

Since May 22-23, 2025, Claude 4 models have taken computer use to the next level. You get new tool versions (computer_20250124), better performance, and the first AI model with Anthropic's ASL-3 safety protections. Want proof? Claude Opus 4 hits 72.5% on SWE-bench Verified (79.4% with parallel test-time compute), while Sonnet 4 reaches 72.7% (80.2% with parallel compute). The latest Claude Opus 4.1, released August 5, 2025, pushes the bar even higher with 74.5% on SWE-bench Verified.

:::warning[Important guidance for AI agent tasks]
Your step-by-step instructions for the AI agent to perform work go into the Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) description. **Start with short, bite-size and easy tasks that are just mundane and tedious.** Do not try and ask an AI agent to do huge, complex decision-driven jobs that are goal-driven - they are prone to indeterministic behavior, hallucination, and it can get very expensive quickly.

:::info[Claude Computer Use vs Claude MCP Integration]
This article covers **Claude Computer Use** - where Claude visually perceives and controls computer interfaces through screenshots, mouse movements, and keyboard actions. This is different from [Claude's MCP integration](/products/pro/integrations/mcp-server/claude-anthropic/), which provides text-based chat access to data sources and APIs.

**When to use each:**
- **Claude Computer Use** (this article): For automating visual UI tasks that require seeing and interacting with interface elements (clicking buttons, filling forms, navigating menus)
- **Claude MCP Integration**: For data queries, API-based automation, and text-based workflow management

**Example comparison:**
- **Computer Use**: "Open Excel, click on cell A1, type a formula, then save the file"
- **MCP Integration**: "Query Tallyfy API for all overdue tasks and generate a report"

Both capabilities can complement each other in comprehensive automation workflows.

### Understanding Claude's Computer Use Feature

Here's the clever part - instead of building thousands of app-specific integrations, Anthropic gave Claude general computer skills. Claude uses an API to see and interact with any application inside a sandboxed environment.

Key aspects of Claude's Computer Use include:

*   **Models Supported:** Claude 4 (Opus and Sonnet), Claude 3.7 Sonnet, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2. Claude 4 models, released May 22-23, 2025, offer enhanced computer use capabilities with extended thinking and tool use integration. Claude Opus 4.1 (August 5, 2025) further improves agentic performance.
*   **Leading Performance:** Claude Opus 4.1 achieves 74.5% on SWE-bench Verified and maintains the 43.2% Terminal-bench score. Both models demonstrate sustained performance on long-running tasks requiring thousands of steps.
*   **API-Driven Interaction:** Developers use Anthropic's Messages API, providing Claude with a set of **Anthropic-defined computer use tools**. Claude then requests to use these tools to achieve a user's goal.
*   **Enhanced Tool Versions:** Each model gets its own tool version:
    *   `computer_20250124` for Claude 4 and Claude 3.7 models (with enhanced actions including "hold_key", "left_mouse_down", "left_mouse_up", "scroll", "triple_click", and "wait")
    *   `computer_20241022` for Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2
*   **The Agent Loop:**
    1.  Your application sends a user prompt and the list of available computer use tools to Claude.
    2.  Claude decides if a tool can help and responds with a `tool_use` request, specifying the tool and its inputs.
    3.  Your application (the client) is responsible for **executing** this tool request in a secure, sandboxed computing environment and then sending the `tool_result` (screenshot, command output, success/failure) back to Claude in a new user message.
    4.  Claude analyzes the result and decides on the next action - either another tool call or a final response. This loop continues until the task is completed.

### How the Claude Computer Use Agent Loop Works

This diagram shows how Tallyfy orchestrates Claude's computer use capabilities through an iterative agent loop where Claude perceives, acts, and receives feedback until your task is complete.
