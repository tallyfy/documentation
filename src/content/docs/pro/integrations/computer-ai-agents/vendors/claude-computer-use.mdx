## Using Anthropic's Claude to complete tasks within Tallyfy

Claude can now control computers by looking at screens, moving cursors, clicking buttons, and typing text. This "Computer Use" capability launched in October 2024 as a public beta feature available through Anthropic's API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Cloud Vertex AI.

:::warning[Important guidance for AI agent tasks]
Your step-by-step instructions for the AI agent to perform work go into the Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) description. **Start with short, bite-size and easy tasks that are just mundane and tedious.** Do not try and ask an AI agent to do huge, complex decision-driven jobs that are goal-driven - they are prone to indeterministic behavior, hallucination, and it can get very expensive quickly.

:::info[Claude Computer Use vs Claude MCP Integration]
This article covers **Claude Computer Use** - where Claude visually perceives and controls computer interfaces through screenshots, mouse movements, and keyboard actions. This is different from [Claude's MCP integration](/products/pro/integrations/mcp-server/claude-anthropic/), which provides text-based chat access to data sources and APIs.

**When to use each:**
- **Claude Computer Use** (this article): For automating visual UI tasks that require seeing and interacting with interface elements (clicking buttons, filling forms, navigating menus)
- **Claude MCP Integration**: For data queries, API-based workflow management, and text-based automation

Both capabilities can complement each other in complete automation workflows.
:::

### Understanding Claude's computer use feature

Instead of building thousands of app-specific integrations, Anthropic gave Claude general computer skills. Claude uses an API to see and interact with any application inside a sandboxed environment.

```d2

Task: "Tallyfy Task\n(Instructions)" {
  shape: circle
  style.fill: "#e1f7e6"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.stroke-width: 2
}

Claude: "Claude Agent" {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#8b5cf6"
  style.font-color: "#fff"
}

Loop: "Perception-Action\nLoop" {
  shape: hexagon
  style.fill: "#fff3cd"
}

Output: "Tallyfy Output\n(Results)" {
  shape: circle
  style.fill: "#e1f7e6"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.stroke-width: 2
}

Task -> Claude: "1. Send task\ndescription" {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.stroke-width: 2
}

Claude -> Loop: "2. Request\nscreenshot" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
}

Loop -> Loop: "3. Take screenshot\n4. Analyze UI\n5. Click/Type\n6. Check result" {
  style.stroke: "#666"
  style.stroke-dash: 3
}

Loop -> Claude: "7. Return\nresult" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
  style.stroke-dash: 3
}

Claude -> Output: "8. Task\ncomplete" {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
  style.stroke-width: 2
}

Claude -> Loop: "Repeat until done" {
  style.stroke: "#666"
  style.stroke-dash: 5
}
```

**What to notice:**
- Tallyfy provides the task description and expected outputs that guide Claude's actions
- Claude loops through screenshot-analyze-act cycles until the task is complete
- All results, logs, and screenshots are captured back into Tallyfy fields

### Current model support and performance

**Available models with Computer Use:**
- **Claude Opus 4.5** - The flagship model, best for complex computer use tasks
- **Claude Sonnet 4** - Primary model for most computer use automation
- **Claude Haiku 4.5** - Available for simpler, faster automation tasks

**Performance benchmarks:**
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 achieved 61.4% on OSWorld (up from 42.2% with Sonnet 4)
- Human performance on OSWorld remains at 72.4%
- The feature is still experimental and error-prone at this stage

### How the Claude computer use agent loop works

This diagram shows how Tallyfy orchestrates Claude's computer use capabilities through an iterative agent loop where Claude perceives, acts, and receives feedback until your task is complete.

```d2
direction: down

Tallyfy: "Tallyfy" {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#e1f7e6"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

App: "Your App\n(Orchestrator)" {
  shape: hexagon
  style.fill: "#fff3cd"
}

Claude: "Claude API" {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#8b5cf6"
  style.font-color: "#fff"
}

Sandbox: "Docker Sandbox\n(Isolated Environment)" {
  shape: cylinder
  style.fill: "#e6f3ff"
}

Tallyfy -> App: "1. Webhook with\ntask data" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
  style.stroke-width: 2
}

App -> Claude: "2. Send prompt +\ncomputer tools" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
}

Claude -> App: "3. Tool use\nrequest" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
  style.stroke-dash: 3
}

App -> Sandbox: "4. Execute tool\n(screenshot/click)" {
  style.stroke: "#666"
}

Sandbox -> App: "5. Return\nresult" {
  style.stroke: "#666"
  style.stroke-dash: 3
}

App -> Claude: "6. Send tool\nresult" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
}

Claude -> Claude: "7. Analyze &\ndecide next" {
  style.stroke: "#666"
  style.stroke-dash: 3
}

Claude -> App: "8. Final response\nor next tool" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
  style.stroke-dash: 3
}

App -> Tallyfy: "9. Update task\nwith results" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
  style.stroke-width: 2
}
```

**What to notice:**
- Tallyfy triggers your intermediary app via webhook with task data
- The loop between Claude and the sandbox continues until the task is complete
- All tool execution happens in an isolated sandbox for security

### Core components

**Sandboxed Computing Environment:** The environment (typically a Docker container) includes:
- A virtual X11 display server (like Xvfb) for rendering the desktop
- A lightweight Linux desktop environment
- Pre-installed applications (Firefox, LibreOffice, text editors)
- Your implementations of the Anthropic-defined tools

**Three Core Tools** (Anthropic-defined, user-executed):
- **computer**: Mouse/keyboard actions (key presses, typing, cursor movement, clicks, scrolling) and taking screenshots
- **text_editor**: View, create, and edit files within the environment
- **bash**: Run shell commands in the sandboxed environment

**Tool Versions:**
- `computer_20250124` for newer models with enhanced actions
- `computer_20241022` for legacy Claude 3.5 Sonnet models

### Pricing

**API Pricing (verify current rates at Anthropic):**
- **Claude Sonnet 4**: $3 per million input tokens, $15 per million output tokens
- **Claude Haiku 4.5**: $0.80 per million input tokens, $4 per million output tokens
- **Additional overhead**: Computer use adds 466-499 tokens to the system prompt

**Access Requirements:**
- Anthropic API key with sufficient credits
- Available through Anthropic API, Amazon Bedrock, or Google Cloud Vertex AI
- Docker required for the reference implementation

### Real-world use cases

Computer Use works well for specific automation scenarios. Early adopters include Asana, Canva, Replit, and DoorDash.

**Suitable applications:**
- Automating form filling across desktop applications
- Extracting data from legacy systems without APIs
- QA and testing tasks with synthetic test case generation
- Navigating multiple applications to complete multi-step workflows
- Desktop navigation and file management tasks

**Example from Replit:** Using Claude's computer use capabilities to evaluate apps as they're built - a key feature requiring visual verification.

### Current limitations

Claude's computer use capability is still developing. Anthropic acknowledges these constraints:

**Technical Limitations:**
- **Latency**: Tasks requiring dozens or hundreds of steps can be slow
- **Error-prone**: Scrolling, dragging, and zooming remain challenging
- **Resolution constraints**: May struggle with screens higher than 1024×768 or 1280×800 due to image scaling
- **Action reliability**: Some actions that people perform effortlessly present challenges for Claude

**Safety Concerns:**
- Claude may follow instructions found in screen content, even if they conflict with user instructions
- Risk of prompt injection from webpages or images
- Potential for scaled abuse if not properly isolated

**Rate Limits:**
- API rate limits apply based on your tier
- Processing time varies significantly based on task complexity

### Getting started with Claude computer use

You'll need to build an intermediary application that connects Tallyfy to the Anthropic API. Anthropic provides a reference implementation with Docker.

<Steps>

1. **Set Up Anthropic API Access:**
   - Obtain an Anthropic API key from the Anthropic Console
   - Familiarize yourself with the API documentation on "Tool Use" and "Computer Use (beta)"

2. **Install Docker:**
   - Install the latest version of Docker on your system
   - This is required for the sandboxed environment

3. **Use the Reference Implementation:**
   - Anthropic provides a Docker-based reference implementation
   - Includes containerized environment, tool implementations, and agent loop
   - Pull the image: `docker pull ghcr.io/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts:computer-use-demo-latest`

4. **Configure the Computing Environment:**
   - Run the Docker container with proper security settings
   - Container runs with minimal privileges (1 CPU, 2GB RAM default)
   - Access the interface at `http://localhost:8080`
   - Never run Claude Computer Use unattended - monitor its actions

5. **Develop the Intermediary Application:**
   - Receive requests via webhook from Tallyfy
   - Construct appropriate prompts and tool lists for the Claude API
   - Manage the agent loop between Claude and your sandbox
   - Relay final outputs back to Tallyfy

6. **Prompt Engineering Best Practices:**
   - Specify simple, well-defined tasks
   - Tell Claude to verify outcomes with screenshots after each step
   - Suggest keyboard shortcuts for complex UI elements
   - Provide examples of successful interactions when available
   - Use XML tags for structured data inputs

</Steps>

### Basic integration example

Here's a simplified example of the integration flow:

```python
from anthropic import Anthropic
import os

client = Anthropic(api_key=os.environ['ANTHROPIC_API_KEY'])

# Basic computer use request
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    max_tokens=1024,
    tools=[
        {
            "type": "computer_20241022",
            "name": "computer",
            "display_width_px": 1024,
            "display_height_px": 768,
        },
        {
            "type": "text_editor_20241022",
            "name": "text_editor",
        },
        {
            "type": "bash_20241022",
            "name": "bash",
        }
    ],
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Open the file manager and navigate to Documents folder"
        }
    ]
)

# Handle tool use requests in the response
# Execute tools in your sandbox
# Return results to Claude
# Continue loop until task complete
```

**Note**: This is a simplified example. Real implementations require full agent loop handling, tool execution in Docker sandbox, and result processing.

### Security best practices

**Critical security measures:**
- Run Claude Computer Use in a dedicated virtual machine or container with minimal privileges
- Limit internet access to approved domains only
- Never provide access to sensitive data or account credentials
- Isolate Claude from production systems
- Require human confirmation for critical actions
- Enable thorough audit logging

**Known Risks:**
- Prompt injection vulnerabilities (Claude may follow on-screen instructions)
- Potential for malicious code execution if not properly sandboxed
- Risk of information theft if given access to sensitive data

### When to use Claude computer use

**Good fit for:**
- Desktop application automation (Excel, legacy software)
- Data extraction from systems without APIs
- Automated testing of desktop applications
- Form filling across multiple applications
- Low-risk, repetitive UI tasks

**Not suitable for:**
- Real-time operations (latency issues)
- Time-critical tasks (can take dozens or hundreds of steps)
- Tasks requiring creative judgment
- Social media content creation (restricted by Anthropic)
- High-security environments without proper isolation

**Success factors:**
- Start with simple, well-defined tasks
- Implement strong security boundaries
- Monitor performance closely
- Maintain human oversight
- Test with low-risk data first

### Comparison with alternatives

Claude Computer Use offers unique desktop control capabilities but has trade-offs:

**Advantages:**
