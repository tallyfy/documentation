## AI agent products - commercial and open source

The Computer AI Agent market has exploded. Let's cut through the noise.

**Enterprise-Ready Leaders:**
- **OpenAI Operator**: Consumer-focused, powered by Computer-Using Agent model, requires ChatGPT Pro subscription
- **Claude Computer Use**: Developer-focused with strong benchmark performance
- **Twin.so**: Enterprise partnerships, real-world deployment with European SMBs

**Open-Source Innovation:**
- **Skyvern**: Strong WebVoyager benchmark performance, transparent per-step pricing
- **Manus AI**: Autonomous task completion, invite-only access

Each vendor brings different strengths to the table - some excel at consumer tasks, others dominate developer workflows. You'll find detailed breakdowns of their technology, benchmarks, and real-world use cases below. We'll also show you exactly how to integrate them with Tallyfy, especially for those frustrating web tasks where APIs just don't exist.

:::warning[Important guidance for AI agent tasks]
Your step-by-step instructions for the AI agent to perform work go into the Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) description. **Start with short, bite-size and easy tasks that are just mundane and tedious.** Do not try and ask an AI agent to do huge, complex decision-driven jobs that are goal-driven - they are prone to indeterministic behavior, hallucination, and it can get very expensive quickly.
