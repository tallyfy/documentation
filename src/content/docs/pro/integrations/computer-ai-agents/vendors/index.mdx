## AI agent products - commercial and open source

This section provides details on various commercial and open-source Computer AI Agent vendors. Each page will cover the specific vendor, their technology, typical use cases, and how they can be integrated with Tallyfy to automate tasks within your processes.

Understanding the offerings of different vendors will help you choose the right agent technology to complement your Tallyfy workflows, particularly for tasks that require interaction with web browsers or other desktop applications where traditional API-based automation is not feasible or is too complex.

:::warning[Important guidance for AI agent tasks]
Your step-by-step instructions for the AI agent to perform work go into the Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) description. **Start with short, bite-size and easy tasks that are just mundane and tedious.** Do not try and ask an AI agent to do huge, complex decision-driven jobs that are goal-driven - they are prone to indeterministic behavior, hallucination, and it can get very expensive quickly.
