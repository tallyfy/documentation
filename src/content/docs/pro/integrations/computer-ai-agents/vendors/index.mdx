## AI agent products - commercial and open source

The Computer AI Agent market has exploded. Let's cut through the noise.

**Enterprise-Ready Leaders:**
- **OpenAI Operator** (January 2025): Consumer-focused, powered by CUA model, $200/month ChatGPT Pro subscription
- **Claude Computer Use** (Enhanced May 2025): Developer-focused with Claude 4 models, leading SWE-bench performance
- **Twin.so** (2024): Enterprise partnerships, real-world deployment with 500,000+ European SMBs

**Open-Source Innovation:**
- **Skyvern** (2025): Industry-leading 85.8% WebVoyager benchmark, transparent $0.10/step pricing
- **Manus AI** (Beta 2025): Autonomous task completion, invite-only access with mixed user feedback

Each vendor brings different strengths to the table - some excel at consumer tasks, others dominate developer workflows. You'll find detailed breakdowns of their technology, benchmarks, and real-world use cases below. We'll also show you exactly how to integrate them with Tallyfy, especially for those frustrating web tasks where APIs just don't exist.

:::warning[Important guidance for AI agent tasks]
Your step-by-step instructions for the AI agent to perform work go into the Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) description. **Start with short, bite-size and easy tasks that are just mundane and tedious.** Do not try and ask an AI agent to do huge, complex decision-driven jobs that are goal-driven - they are prone to indeterministic behavior, hallucination, and it can get very expensive quickly.
