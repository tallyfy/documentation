## AI agent products - commercial and open source

The Computer AI Agent market has rapidly matured in 2025, with several distinct categories of vendors emerging:

**Enterprise-Ready Leaders:**
- **OpenAI Operator** (January 2025): Consumer-focused, powered by CUA model, $200/month ChatGPT Pro subscription
- **Claude Computer Use** (Enhanced May 2025): Developer-focused with Claude 4 models, leading SWE-bench performance
- **Twin.so** (2024): Enterprise partnerships, real-world deployment with 500,000+ European SMBs

**Open-Source Innovation:**
- **Skyvern** (2025): Industry-leading 85.8% WebVoyager benchmark, transparent $0.10/step pricing
- **Manus AI** (Beta 2025): Autonomous task completion, invite-only access with mixed user feedback

This section provides details on each vendor's technology, performance benchmarks, typical use cases, and integration approaches with Tallyfy. Understanding these offerings will help you choose the right agent technology for your workflows, particularly for tasks requiring web browser interaction where traditional API-based automation is inadequate.

:::warning[Important guidance for AI agent tasks]
Your step-by-step instructions for the AI agent to perform work go into the Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) description. **Start with short, bite-size and easy tasks that are just mundane and tedious.** Do not try and ask an AI agent to do huge, complex decision-driven jobs that are goal-driven - they are prone to indeterministic behavior, hallucination, and it can get very expensive quickly.
