## AI agent products - commercial and open source

Here's what's available in the computer AI agent space right now.

**Commercial options:**
- **OpenAI Operator** - Consumer-focused, powered by Computer-Using Agent model, requires ChatGPT Pro subscription
- **Claude Computer Use** - Developer-focused with strong benchmark performance
- **Twin.so** - Enterprise partnerships, deployed with European SMBs

**Open-source options:**
- **Skyvern** - Strong WebVoyager benchmark performance, transparent per-step pricing
- **Manus AI** - Autonomous task completion, invite-only access

Each vendor targets different use cases. Some focus on consumer tasks, others on developer workflows. The vendor pages below cover their technology, benchmarks, and how to integrate them with Tallyfy - particularly for web tasks where no API exists.

:::warning[Important guidance for AI agent tasks]
Put your step-by-step instructions in the Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) description. **Start with short, bite-size, easy tasks that are mundane and tedious.** Don't ask an AI agent to handle large, decision-driven jobs - they're prone to unpredictable behavior, hallucination, and costs can escalate fast.
