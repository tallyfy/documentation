## Completing Tallyfy tasks with Manus AI agents

Manus AI, built by Chinese startup Monica (also called Butterfly Effect AI), is a fully autonomous AI agent. It understands complex goals and delivers finished results without constant supervision. The company reports top scores on the GAIA benchmark. Because it handles web research, data analysis, planning, and content generation, Manus AI could pair well with Tallyfy for cognitive work that goes beyond simple browser clicks.

:::warning[Important guidance for AI agent tasks]
Your step-by-step instructions for the AI agent to perform work go into the Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) description. **Start with short, bite-size and easy tasks that are just mundane and tedious.** Do not try and ask an AI agent to do huge, complex decision-driven jobs that are goal-driven - they are prone to indeterministic behavior, hallucination, and it can get very expensive quickly.

**What to notice:**
- **Asynchronous processing** - Tasks run in the cloud for 30-60 minutes while your team does other work
- **Multi-agent collaboration** - Specialized agents work in parallel on different parts of a task
- **Complete deliverables** - Unlike simple automation, Manus produces finished reports and analysis

### How Manus AI works

You give Manus a goal, and it runs asynchronously in the cloud to achieve it. Unlike traditional AI assistants that just respond to prompts, Manus operates on its own - making decisions, completing tasks, and producing finished results.

*   **Full autonomy:** It automates entire tasks from start to finish - planning, execution, and delivery.
*   **Multi-agent architecture:** Specialized sub-agents handle planning, information retrieval, web browsing, and code execution in parallel.
*   **Foundation models:** Manus uses existing LLMs including Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3.7 Sonnet from Anthropic, plus fine-tuned versions of Alibaba's Qwen models.
*   **Asynchronous cloud operation:** Assign a task and walk away. Come back later to find your results ready.
*   **Iterative agent loop:** The system cycles continuously:
    1.  **Analyze events:** Examines user requests and current task status
    2.  **Select tools and plan:** Chooses tools and refines plans using a Planner Module
    3.  **Execute commands:** Runs actions in a secure Linux sandbox
    4.  **Observe and iterate:** Evaluates results and repeats until done
*   **CodeAct approach:** Manus often writes and runs Python code on the fly to accomplish tasks.
*   **Tool usage:** Web browsers, shell commands, file management, and code execution (Python, JavaScript) are all available.
*   **Memory systems:** The agent tracks progress through event streams and file-based memory, even creating `todo.md` files to monitor itself.

### Current status and availability

Manus AI is still in active development with expanding access:

*   **Access:** Register at manus.im - there's a free tier with one daily task (300 credits)
*   **Pricing:** $19/month (Basic) to $199/month (Pro)
*   **Geographic restrictions:** Works best outside mainland China, since the Western LLM models it relies on create access issues there
*   **Development status:** The platform keeps improving with updates like Manus 1.6 Max, which added better task completion and spreadsheet capabilities

### Performance claims and benchmarks

*   **GAIA benchmark:** Manus claims top performance across difficulty levels
*   **Task completion:** It can tackle multi-step tasks that need sustained attention and reasoning

Independent verification of these benchmark claims is limited, so treat performance numbers with skepticism.

### Getting started with Manus AI (conceptual for Tallyfy)

Manus AI access has expanded beyond private beta, but direct Tallyfy integration depends on API availability.

<Steps>

1.  **Request access:**
    *   Visit `manus.im` and sign up or join the waitlist.

2.  **Review capabilities:**
    *   Check demos and documentation to understand how Manus AI handles multi-step tasks autonomously.

3.  **Identify complex Tallyfy tasks:**
    *   Look for Tallyfy [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) that need more than simple UI automation - things like research, multi-step analysis, data synthesis, or content generation.

4.  **Define clear goals:**
    *   For each task, write goals that Manus AI can understand and break down. Tallyfy form fields supply the specific parameters.

5.  **Plan integration architecture:**
    *   Plan for future API availability that would let Tallyfy send tasks to Manus and retrieve structured results.

</Steps>

### How Tallyfy could integrate with Manus AI (example)

Here's a research-heavy example:

**Tallyfy task:** "Generate market analysis report for new product launch"

*   **Inputs from Tallyfy [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/):**
    *   `Product Category`: "Smart wearable devices"
    *   `Target Market`: "Health-conscious consumers, fitness enthusiasts"
    *   `Competitor Analysis Scope`: "Top 5 market leaders"
    *   `Geographic Focus`: "North American market"
    *   `Budget Range`: "$100-$300 price point"
*   **Integration steps (conceptual - assuming future API):**
    1.  A Tallyfy [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) reaches this task.
    2.  Tallyfy sends a request to the Manus AI API with a goal like: "Conduct market analysis for smart wearable devices targeting health-conscious consumers in North America. Research top 5 competitors in the $100-$300 range. Analyze trends, pricing strategies, and opportunities. Generate a structured report."
    3.  Manus AI's Planner Module breaks the work into subtasks: market research, competitor analysis, trend spotting, data synthesis, report writing.
    4.  Sub-agents browse the web, crunch data, and generate content in parallel.
    5.  After 30-60 minutes, Manus AI delivers the market analysis document.
    6.  Tallyfy receives the report, updates the task, and your team reviews it before moving on.

### Use cases

**Business and marketing:**
*   Recruiting and interview optimization
*   Market analysis and competitive intelligence
*   SEO strategy development

**Data analysis:**
*   Financial insights and investment analysis
*   Consumer analytics and sentiment tracking
*   Industry research

**Content creation:**
*   Research report generation
*   Educational material development
*   Document generation and organization

### User feedback

**What works well:**
*   Deep analysis that exceeds expectations
*   Successful completion of multi-step tasks
*   Time savings on research-heavy work

**Common complaints:**
*   Tasks take 30 minutes to over an hour (OpenAI Operator is much faster)
*   Frequent crashes - beta software shows
*   Research often comes back without citations
*   Complex tasks requiring sustained reasoning often fail
*   Servers get overloaded during busy times
*   Performance varies wildly across task types

### Benefits

*   **Autonomous task execution:** Hand off research and analysis tasks to an AI that actually finishes them.
*   **Handles broad goals:** Give it a high-level objective. It figures out the steps.
*   **End-to-end completion:** From initial research to final deliverable - Manus handles the whole workflow.
*   **Asynchronous operation:** Your team focuses on strategy while Manus works in the background.
*   **Multi-modal capabilities:** Text, images, and data from various sources - it processes them all.

### Potential considerations

*   **Beta status:** You can't properly test it yet. Planning an integration around it is risky.
*   **Performance variability:** Complex tasks work sometimes and fail other times.
*   **Verification challenges:** Benchmark scores can't be verified independently due to access restrictions.
*   **Technical dependencies:** It's built on Claude and Qwen models - not their own. That's a dependency risk.
*   **Cost:** Paid plans range from $19-$199/month, which may not justify routine tasks.
*   **Reliability:** Beta users report crashes and failures that need human intervention.
*   **Task scoping:** You need to be precise but not too prescriptive. Finding that balance takes practice.

Tallyfy and Manus AI could eventually work together for complex cognitive tasks, but the platform needs time to mature before it's stable enough for production integration.
