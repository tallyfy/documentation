## Using OpenAI Operator Agents with Tallyfy

OpenAI launched Operator on January 23, 2025 - their first AI agent that actually does things on the web for you. It interacts with browser interfaces like a human would. Want it? You'll need a ChatGPT Pro subscription at $200/month. The agent understands natural language instructions, navigates websites, fills out forms, and takes actions on your behalf, which opens up exciting possibilities for automating web-based steps within Tallyfy processes.

It's still in research preview. But here's the thing: Operator marks OpenAI's first real attempt at autonomous agent technology, using their Computer-Using Agent (CUA) model to handle practical web automation tasks.

:::warning[Important guidance for AI agent tasks]
Your step-by-step instructions for the AI agent to perform work go into the Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) description. **Start with short, bite-size and easy tasks that are just mundane and tedious.** Do not try and ask an AI agent to do huge, complex decision-driven jobs that are goal-driven - they are prone to indeterministic behavior, hallucination, and it can get very expensive quickly.

### Understanding OpenAI Operator: How It Works

Operator isn't just another chatbot - it's OpenAI's first product that can actually take action for you. The agent runs in its own browser environment where you can watch what it's doing and step in if needed.

Here's what makes Operator tick:

*   **Computer-Using Agent (CUA) Model:** Operator runs on OpenAI's specialized CUA model, built on GPT-4o architecture but specifically trained for computer interaction tasks. Performance? 38.1% on OSWorld and 58.1% on WebArena benchmarks.
*   **Enhanced Safety Measures:** The CUA model includes safety fine-tuning for computer use, with additional datasets that teach appropriate decision boundaries on confirmations and refusals. It's much better at resisting prompt injection attacks than standard language models.
*   **Browser Interaction & Visual Perception:** Operator works within its own dedicated browser environment. It "sees" web pages by capturing screenshots and uses vision capabilities to spot buttons, text fields, links, and menus - basically anything you'd click on.
*   **Natural Language Tasking & Reasoning:** You tell Operator what you want in plain English (like "Order a large pepperoni pizza from DoorDash to my home address"). The CUA model breaks down your request into actionable steps, plans its actions, and adapts based on what it encounters.
*   **Simulated Human Actions:** Operator completes tasks by simulating human inputs - mouse clicks for navigation and selection, keyboard typing for forms and search queries. Simple as that.
*   **Self-Correction & User Control:** When the agent hits errors or unexpected page states, it can self-correct. For sensitive stuff like entering login credentials or confirming payments, Operator pauses and asks for your approval. You can watch everything in its browser window and step in anytime.
*   **Third-Party Partnerships:** OpenAI partnered with major service providers (DoorDash, Instacart, OpenTable, Priceline) to ensure Operator handles common tasks smoothly on these platforms.

### Current Availability and Access

Where can you actually get Operator in 2025? Here's the situation:

*   **Subscription Requirements:** ChatGPT Pro subscribers only - that's $200/month
*   **Geographic Expansion:** Started in the United States, now available in Australia, Canada, and the UK. More countries coming soon.
*   **Research Preview Status:** Still in research preview as OpenAI refines the technology and gathers user feedback
*   **API Access:** Developers can access the Computer-Using Agent (CUA) model through OpenAI's API, but the consumer Operator interface is web-only through ChatGPT Pro
*   **Usage Patterns:** Early reviews show promising task completion rates, though performance varies quite a bit depending on website complexity and how clearly you define tasks

### Performance Benchmarks and Capabilities

How well does Operator actually work? The benchmarks tell an interesting story:

*   **OSWorld Performance:** Hits 38.1% on the OSWorld benchmark, which tests real-world computer use tasks across different operating system environments
*   **WebArena Results:** Scores 58.1% on WebArena - that's web navigation and task completion across realistic scenarios
*   **CUA Model Foundation:** The Computer-Using Agent (CUA) model powering Operator was specifically designed for computer interaction tasks with enhanced safety fine-tuning
*   **Task Categories:** Works best for:
    *   Online shopping and e-commerce interactions
    *   Restaurant reservations and booking systems  
    *   Form filling and data entry tasks
    *   Simple research and information gathering
    *   Invoice and document retrieval from web portals
*   **Speed Improvements:** Most tasks finish in 15 minutes or less. That's faster than many competing agent platforms.
*   **Limitations:** Still struggles with highly complex interfaces, multi-page workflows that need sustained context, and websites with advanced anti-bot measures

### Getting Started with OpenAI Operator (Conceptual for Tallyfy Integration)

<Steps>

1.  **Verify Access & Subscription:**
    *   Make sure you have an active ChatGPT Pro subscription ($200/month) and you're in a supported region (US, Australia, Canada, UK).

2.  **Familiarize Yourself with Operator's Interface:**
    *   Access Operator through your ChatGPT Pro interface. Get to know its capabilities, how it interprets prompts, and current limitations while it's in research preview.

3.  **Identify Tallyfy Tasks for Operator:**
    *   Look for tasks within your Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) that involve web interactions - things like online ordering, booking appointments, or data lookups on public websites.

4.  **Formulate Clear Prompts:**
    *   Write precise natural language instructions for Operator. Pull these instructions from the Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) description and any relevant [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) data.

5.  **Integration Considerations:**
    *   **API Integration:** The CUA model is available through OpenAI's API for programmatic integration, letting you build custom automations beyond the web interface.
    *   **Webhook Integration:** Connect with Tallyfy using webhook-based triggers or custom solutions that interact with the API endpoints.

</Steps>

### How Tallyfy Could Integrate with OpenAI Operator (Example Scenario)

Let's walk through a real example. **Tallyfy Task:** "Make Dinner Reservation for 2 at 'The Italian Place' for Friday 7 PM"

*   **Inputs from Tallyfy [Form Fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/):**
    *   `Restaurant Name`: "The Italian Place"
    *   `Party Size`: 2
    *   `Desired Date`: "Next Friday"
    *   `Desired Time`: "7:00 PM"
    *   `User Contact for Reservation`: (From Tallyfy user profile or form field)
*   **Integration Steps (Conceptual):**
    1.  The Tallyfy [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) activates this task.
    2.  Tallyfy sends the goal to Operator through the CUA API: "Make a dinner reservation at 'The Italian Place' for 2 people for next Friday at 7:00 PM. Use OpenTable or the restaurant's website. Confirm availability and make the booking under [User Contact Name] and [User Phone Number]."
    3.  Operator processes this request with its CUA model. First stop? Searching for "The Italian Place" on OpenTable or the restaurant's own website.
    4.  The agent navigates the booking interface, selects date, time, and party size using its computer vision and interaction capabilities. Just like you would.
    5.  Need login credentials or extra personal details? Operator pauses for human confirmation. In an integrated Tallyfy setup, this approval request would pop back to the Tallyfy user.
    6.  After attempting the reservation, Operator returns the result: either "Reservation confirmed for The Italian Place, Friday at 7 PM, Confirmation #XYZ" or "No availability found."
    7.  Tallyfy gets this result, updates the task form field ('Reservation Status', 'Confirmation Number'), and your workflow continues smoothly.

### Benefits

*   **Leading Technology:** You get access to OpenAI's cutting-edge computer use capabilities and ongoing improvements in the CUA model.
*   **Automate Common Web Tasks:** Handles everyday online tasks - shopping, bookings, form submissions - with growing reliability.
*   **Natural Language for Complex Actions:** Define multi-step web automation goals using simple instructions. No need to specify every single step.
*   **Enhanced Safety:** Built-in safety measures reduce risks from prompt injection and inappropriate actions.
*   **Strong Partnership Integration:** Works especially well on popular platforms thanks to OpenAI's partnerships with major service providers.
*   **Trackable Delegated Tasks within Tallyfy:** Tallyfy provides the structured process context, defining when Operator should act, what data it needs, and what to do with results - perfectly aligned with Tallyfy's "Trackable AI" principles.

### Potential Considerations

*   **Research Preview Limitations:** It's early-stage technology. Expect occasional failures and ongoing improvements. Don't use it for critical business processes without human oversight.
*   **Subscription Cost:** That $200/month ChatGPT Pro subscription adds up. You'll need to evaluate cost-effectiveness based on your task volume and the value it delivers.
*   **API vs. Interface Access:** While the CUA model is available through the API, getting full Operator functionality integrated seamlessly with Tallyfy might require additional development work.
*   **Geographic Limitations:** Only available in the US, Australia, Canada, and UK right now. This could impact global deployment strategies.
*   **Performance Variability:** Success rates vary quite a bit based on website complexity and how specific your tasks are. Simple, well-defined tasks work better than complex multi-step operations.
*   **Complex UI Challenges:** Really complex or rapidly changing website UIs (or those with advanced anti-bot measures) can still trip it up.
*   **Data Privacy and Security:** When Operator handles credentials and personal information, you're relying on OpenAI's infrastructure and safety protocols.

OpenAI Operator is still evolving beyond its research preview status. For Tallyfy users, it's a promising tool to automate web-based interactions within structured processes - just evaluate the current limitations carefully and plan for gradual adoption as the technology improves.
