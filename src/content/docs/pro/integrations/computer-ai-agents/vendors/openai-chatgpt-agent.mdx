## Using OpenAI agent capabilities with Tallyfy

:::note[Information Currency]
OpenAI's agent features evolve rapidly. OpenAI Operator (launched January 2025) was deprecated in August 2025 and replaced by "ChatGPT agent" mode integrated directly into ChatGPT. Check OpenAI's official documentation for the latest capabilities, pricing, and availability.
:::

OpenAI provides agent capabilities through several tools: the Responses API, Agents SDK, and Computer Use (CUA) model. These work with Tallyfy to automate workflow tasks that involve web interactions, document processing, and data extraction.

OpenAI's Operator (launched January 2025, deprecated August 2025) demonstrated browser automation using the Computer-Using Agent (CUA) model. The CUA model now uses o3 reasoning capabilities instead of the original GPT-4o. The model scored 38.1% on the OSWorld benchmark and 58.1% on WebArena - showing limitations for complex automation. These capabilities are now available through "ChatGPT agent" mode in ChatGPT.

More recently, OpenAI released the Responses API and open-source Agents SDK, which provide developers with tools for building AI agents that combine multiple capabilities including web search, file processing, and computer use.

:::warning[Important guidance for AI agent tasks]
Your step-by-step instructions for the AI agent to perform work go into the Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) description. **Start with short, bite-size and easy tasks that are just mundane and tedious.** Do not try and ask an AI agent to do huge, complex decision-driven jobs that are goal-driven - they are prone to indeterministic behavior, hallucination, and it can get very expensive quickly.

### How OpenAI agents work with Tallyfy

Tallyfy orchestrates OpenAI agent capabilities by triggering tasks, providing structured inputs, and capturing outputs. The integration uses webhooks or API calls to connect Tallyfy processes with OpenAI's agent tools.

```d2
T: "Tallyfy Task"
W: "Webhook/API"
A: "OpenAI Agent"
C: "Computer Use"
S: "Web Search"
F: "File Search"
O: "Output"
U: "Update Task"

T -> W: Task triggered
W -> A: Send instructions
A -> C: Browser automation
A -> S: Research
A -> F: Document processing
C -> O
S -> O
F -> O
O -> U: Return results
U -> T: Complete task
```

**What to notice:**
- **Multiple tools** - OpenAI agents use computer use, web search, and file search based on task requirements
- **Structured data flow** - Tallyfy provides inputs through form fields and captures agent outputs for downstream tasks
- **Error handling** - Failed tasks can route to human review through Tallyfy's conditional logic

### OpenAI agent capabilities

OpenAI's agent platform includes several components that work together:

**Responses API**: Combines chat capabilities with multi-tool support, allowing agents to use web search, file search, and computer use within a single API call.

**Agents SDK**: Open-source toolkit for building single-agent and multi-agent workflows. Works with OpenAI models and competitor models from Anthropic and Google.

**Computer Use (CUA)**: Browser automation powered by the CUA model with o3 reasoning. Captures screenshots, identifies UI elements, and simulates mouse/keyboard actions. Available through "ChatGPT agent" mode in ChatGPT.

**Web Search**: Integration with GPT-4o search providing factual accuracy of 90% on SimpleQA benchmark. Includes citations to original sources.

**File Search**: Document retrieval from large document sets with metadata filtering support.

### Integration with Tallyfy workflows

Tallyfy provides structure for OpenAI agent automation:

**Trackable execution**: Every agent action happens within a Tallyfy process with full audit trail.

**Error recovery**: When agents encounter issues, Tallyfy's conditional logic can route tasks to humans for completion.

**Incremental approach**: Start with simple tasks like form filling or data extraction. Monitor results. Expand gradually to more complex workflows.

**MCP support**: With Model Context Protocol servers, OpenAI agents can interact with Tallyfy using natural language commands like "complete the next task in customer onboarding."

### Technical details of OpenAI agent capabilities

The Computer-Using Agent (CUA) model now uses o3 reasoning capabilities:

**Visual perception**: Captures screenshots of web pages and identifies UI elements like buttons, text fields, and links.

**Action execution**: Simulates mouse clicks and keyboard input to interact with websites.

**Safety controls**: Pauses for user approval before sensitive actions like payments or credential entry. Includes fine-tuning to resist prompt injection attacks.

**Performance benchmarks** (original CUA model):
- OSWorld: 38.1% (real-world computer tasks)
- WebArena: 58.1% (web navigation scenarios)
- Performance may improve with o3-based updates

**Best suited for**:
- Form filling and data entry
- Restaurant reservations and bookings
- Simple information gathering
- Document retrieval from web portals

**Limitations**: Struggles with complex interfaces, multi-page workflows requiring sustained context, and websites with anti-bot measures.

### Current availability

**ChatGPT agent mode**: Available to ChatGPT Plus, Pro, and Enterprise subscribers. Access by selecting "agent mode" from the dropdown in the ChatGPT composer.

**API access**: Available through Responses API and Agents SDK.

**Note**: Features, pricing, and availability change frequently. See [OpenAI's pricing page](https://openai.com/pricing) for current rates and subscription details.

### Integration approach

<Steps>

1. **Identify suitable tasks**
   Look for Tallyfy [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) that involve web interactions - online ordering, booking appointments, data extraction from public websites.

2. **Write clear instructions**
   Create specific natural language instructions in task descriptions. Include exact URLs, button names, and expected outputs.

3. **Choose integration method**
   - API integration using Responses API or Agents SDK
   - Webhook triggers from Tallyfy to your custom middleware
   - MCP server for natural language control

4. **Test incrementally**
   Start with simple, low-risk tasks. Monitor success rates. Adjust instructions based on results before expanding to more complex workflows.

5. **Implement error handling**
   Use Tallyfy's conditional logic to route failed or partially completed tasks to human review.

</Steps>

### Example workflow: restaurant reservation

**Scenario**: Automate restaurant reservations for client meetings.

**Tallyfy task configuration**:
- Task description contains clear instructions: "Make reservation on OpenTable for the restaurant and date specified in form fields"
- Form fields collect: restaurant name, party size, date/time, special requests
- Webhook triggers when task is assigned

**Agent execution**:
1. Receives structured data from Tallyfy webhook
2. Navigates to restaurant booking site
3. Fills reservation form
4. Captures confirmation number
5. Returns result to Tallyfy

**Result handling**:
- Success: Confirmation number stored in form field, next task triggered
- Failure: Task reassigned to human with error details
- Partial completion: Flagged for manual review

### Integration options

**Responses API**: Send task instructions and data directly to OpenAI's API. Agent uses available tools (web search, computer use, file search) to complete the task.

**Agents SDK**: Build custom workflow orchestration using the open-source SDK. Supports multi-agent workflows and mixed model usage.

**MCP server**: Create a Model Context Protocol server that exposes Tallyfy operations. OpenAI agents can then interact with Tallyfy using natural language.

**Webhook architecture**: Use message queues between Tallyfy and OpenAI to handle high-volume automation with retry logic and parallel processing.

### Use case examples

**Invoice data extraction**:
- Agent navigates to supplier portal
- Downloads invoices
- Extracts key data (invoice number, amount, date)
- Returns structured data to Tallyfy
- Human reviews before accounting entry

**Customer onboarding tasks**:
- Creating collaboration workspace invites
- Setting up shared folders
- Scheduling kickoff meetings
- Generating welcome communications
- Human handles contract review and customization

**Competitive research**:
- Visits competitor websites
- Captures pricing and feature information
- Compares with previous data
- Generates summary report
- Routes to team for analysis

### Configuration considerations

**Task instructions**: Write specific, clear instructions. Include exact URLs, button names, field labels, and expected outputs.

Good: "Navigate to acme.com/invoices, download PDFs from last 30 days, extract invoice numbers and amounts"
Poor: "Get the invoices"

**Security**: Never store passwords in task descriptions. Use secure credential management. Enable user approval for sensitive actions.

**Error handling**: Configure Tallyfy conditional logic to route failed tasks to humans. Log agent actions for debugging.

**Monitoring**: Track success rates by task type. Adjust instructions based on failure patterns.

### API pricing

OpenAI API pricing varies by model (GPT-4o, o1, o3, o4-mini) and changes frequently. See [OpenAI's pricing page](https://openai.com/pricing) for current rates.

### Troubleshooting

**Task fails repeatedly**:
- Instructions may be too vague - add specific details (button names, URLs, exact text)
- Website may have anti-bot measures - consider manual fallback
- Dynamic content loading - agent may need explicit wait instructions
- Login credentials missing or incorrect

**Integration not triggering**:
- Verify webhook URL is accessible
- Check authentication tokens
- Confirm Tallyfy process is published and active
- Review webhook logs for error responses

**Partial completion**:
- Use Tallyfy conditional logic to route partially completed tasks to humans
- Add verification steps after agent tasks
- Track patterns in partial completions to refine instructions

### Limitations

**Current constraints**:

- Performance on complex tasks is limited (38% OSWorld, 58% WebArena benchmarks for original CUA model)
- Processing time varies, typically several minutes per task
- Geographic availability limited to select regions
- Experimental technology - expect changes and occasional failures
- Requires careful credential management for security
- Not suitable for tasks requiring nuanced decision-making

**Best practices**:

- Start with simple, high-volume tasks
- Always have human fallback for critical processes
- Test thoroughly before production deployment
- Monitor success rates and adjust instructions
- Use Tallyfy's conditional logic for error handling
- Keep instructions simple and specific
