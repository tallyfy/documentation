## Using Twin.so AI agents with Tallyfy

Twin.so builds AI agents that control web browsers to automate tasks - no API required. Their agents interact with websites like a human would, clicking buttons and filling forms. Twin Labs (founded 2024) has proven this works at scale with their Invoice Operator serving over 500,000 European SMB customers through a partnership with Qonto, a fintech platform.

:::warning[Important guidance for AI agent tasks]
Your step-by-step instructions for the AI agent to perform work go into the Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) description. **Start with short, bite-size and easy tasks that are just mundane and tedious.** Do not try and ask an AI agent to do huge, complex decision-driven jobs that are goal-driven - they are prone to indeterministic behavior, hallucination, and it can get very expensive quickly.

### How browser automation works with Tallyfy

This flowchart shows a conceptual integration pattern where Tallyfy orchestrates browser automation to retrieve documents from web portals.

```d2
Tallyfy: Tallyfy Task {
  shape: circle
  style.fill: "#e1f7e6"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

Webhook: Webhook Trigger {
  shape: hexagon
  style.fill: "#fff3cd"
}

API: Browser Automation API {
  shape: rectangle
}

Vault: Credential Storage {
  shape: cylinder
}

Browser: Remote Browser {
  shape: rectangle
}

Navigate: Navigate to Site {
  shape: rectangle
}

Login: Login with Credentials {
  shape: rectangle
}

Extract: Extract Data {
  shape: rectangle
}

Return: Return Results {
  shape: hexagon
  style.fill: "#e6ffe6"
}

Update: Update Tallyfy {
  shape: circle
  style.fill: "#e1f7e6"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

Tallyfy -> Webhook: Trigger
Webhook -> API: Start task
API -> Vault: Get credentials
Vault -> Browser: Inject credentials
Browser -> Navigate: Navigate
Navigate -> Login: Login
Login -> Extract: Extract
Extract -> Return: Return
Return -> Update: Update
```

**What to notice:**
- **Credential security** - Sensitive login information stored separately from task descriptions
- **Sequential execution** - Tasks proceed step-by-step through navigation, login, and data extraction
- **Result delivery** - Extracted data or documents returned to Tallyfy for workflow continuation

### What Twin.so offers

Twin.so provides AI agents for browser-based automation. According to their publicly available information:

**Core Capabilities:**
- **Browser control** - Agents navigate websites and interact with web applications
- **Natural language goals** - Provide a starting URL and goal in plain English
- **Production deployment** - Invoice Operator handles invoice retrieval for 500,000+ European SMBs
- **OpenAI collaboration** - One of 15 companies chosen to alpha-test OpenAI's Computer-Using Agent (CUA) model
- **Credential management** - Secure vault system for storing website login credentials
- **Enterprise infrastructure** - Built for scale with browser infrastructure designed for enterprise use

**Technology Foundation:**
- Uses remote Chromium browser sessions for automation
- Powered by AI models including OpenAI's CUA technology
- Adaptive to website changes (unlike traditional RPA scripts)
- Processes tasks through their Twin Model (action planning system)

**Performance Claims:**
Twin.so states they've improved performance significantly over three generations of their technology. They report 6x speed increases, 35x cost reductions, and 55% accuracy improvements over the past year.

### Real-world deployment: Invoice Operator

Twin.so's first major product is the Invoice Operator, built in partnership with Qonto (European fintech) and OpenAI:

- **Scale** - Serves 500,000+ SMBs across Europe
- **Function** - Automatically retrieves invoices from vendor portals
- **Support** - Works with thousands of different invoice provider websites
- **Integration** - Embedded directly in Qonto's platform for seamless operation

This deployment demonstrates that browser automation can work at production scale for repetitive document retrieval tasks.

### Potential integration with Tallyfy

Twin.so focuses on enterprise partnerships rather than self-service integration. Integration with Tallyfy would likely require:

<Steps>

1. **Contact Twin.so for enterprise access**

   Twin.so works directly with enterprise customers to build specialized agents. Reach out through their website to discuss integration possibilities.

2. **Define your automation use cases**

   Identify Tallyfy [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) that involve repetitive browser-based work - invoice downloads, portal checks, data extraction from web forms.

3. **Explore API integration options**

   Twin.so provides an API at `https://api.twin.so` with endpoints for task management (start tasks, check status, retrieve results). Integration architecture would depend on your specific needs.

4. **Set up credential management**

   Twin.so's Vaults feature securely stores website credentials. Your automation tasks would reference these vaulted credentials rather than exposing passwords.

5. **Work with Twin.so's team on implementation**

   Custom integration development would be required to connect Twin.so's browser automation with Tallyfy's workflow orchestration.

</Steps>

### Example automation scenario

Here's how a Tallyfy-Twin.so integration might work for invoice retrieval:

**Tallyfy Task**: "Retrieve Monthly Invoice from Service Provider"

**Task Inputs** (from Tallyfy [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/)):
- Service provider name
- Invoice date/period
- Credential vault reference

**Automation Flow**:
1. Tallyfy task triggers webhook when assigned
2. Webhook calls Twin.so API with task goal
3. Twin.so agent navigates to provider's billing portal
4. Agent logs in using vaulted credentials
5. Agent locates and downloads specified invoice
6. Twin.so returns invoice file and metadata
7. Tallyfy receives results and updates task

This pattern could apply to various document retrieval and web-based data extraction scenarios.

### Use cases for browser automation

Combining Tallyfy's workflow management with browser automation could address:

- **Invoice collection** - Retrieve invoices from multiple vendor portals automatically
- **Supplier monitoring** - Check order status and delivery tracking across supplier websites
- **Data extraction** - Pull customer information from web-based systems without APIs
- **Compliance documentation** - Download required documents from regulatory portals
- **Financial aggregation** - Collect account information from multiple banking websites
- **E-commerce operations** - Monitor inventory, pricing, and product listings across platforms

### Important considerations

**Enterprise Partnership Model:**
- Twin.so focuses on enterprise customers with custom implementations
- No self-service signup or standard pricing available publicly
- Expect to work directly with their team for any integration

**Integration Requirements:**
- Custom development needed to connect with Tallyfy
- API integration requires technical implementation work
- Enterprise partnerships likely have minimum volume commitments

**Best Fit Scenarios:**
- High-volume repetitive tasks (like invoice processing at scale)
- Browser-based work that can't be automated through APIs
- Document retrieval from multiple web portals
- Operations requiring navigation of complex web interfaces

**Current Geographic Focus:**
- Most deployments currently in Europe (via Qonto partnership)
- Availability in other regions would need verification with Twin.so

For production integration with Tallyfy, contact Twin.so directly to discuss your specific automation needs and integration requirements.
