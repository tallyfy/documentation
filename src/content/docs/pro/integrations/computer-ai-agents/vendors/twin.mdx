## Leveraging Twin.so AI Agents with Tallyfy

Twin.so offers sophisticated AI agents designed to automate complex operations by directly interacting with web applications through a browser, mimicking human behavior. Developed by Twin Labs (founded 2024), Twin.so has achieved significant real-world deployment success, including their "Invoice Operator" serving 500,000 European SMBs through their partnership with Qonto and OpenAI. This capability makes Twin.so a strong candidate for integration with Tallyfy, especially for automating tasks where traditional API-based automation is unavailable or impractical.

:::warning[Important guidance for AI agent tasks]
Your step-by-step instructions for the AI agent to perform work go into the Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) description. **Start with short, bite-size and easy tasks that are just mundane and tedious.** Do not try and ask an AI agent to do huge, complex decision-driven jobs that are goal-driven - they are prone to indeterministic behavior, hallucination, and it can get very expensive quickly.

### Understanding Twin.so AI Agents

Twin.so's AI agents, often referred to as "skilled agents," are built to understand goals and autonomously navigate and interact with web interfaces. They are not reliant on pre-existing APIs for the applications they automate.

Key characteristics of Twin.so agents include:

*   **Browser-Based Interaction:** Agents operate directly within a web browser (typically a remote Chromium-based browser session), controlling the interface to perform tasks.
*   **Natural Language Goals:** You provide the agent with a `starting URL` and a `goal` defined in natural language. The agent then interprets this goal to carry out the necessary actions.
*   **Production-Scale Deployment:** Successfully deployed at enterprise scale, with Invoice Operator handling millions of invoices monthly across 500,000 European SMBs through Qonto.
*   **OpenAI CUA Integration:** Twin was selected as one of 15 companies to alpha-test OpenAI's Computer-Using Agent (CUA) model, the same technology that powers OpenAI's Operator.
*   **Adaptive and Robust:** Twin.so emphasizes that its agents can adapt to changes in website layouts and are more robust than brittle RPA scripts. They reason in real-time at each step.
*   **Secure Access:** Agents can use your private `access key` or credentials stored securely in Twin.so Vaults to automatically log into authenticated apps on your behalf.
*   **Enterprise Infrastructure:** They provide scalable, low-latency browser infrastructure designed for enterprise-grade security and large-scale operations.
*   **Performance Leadership:** Latest generation Twin A3 achieves 6-second latency per step, $0.03 cost per step, and 84% accuracy - representing industry-leading efficiency in browser automation.

### How Twin.so Works in Detail

Twin.so's automation capability is centered around its **Twin Agent** and proprietary **Twin Model** (also known as Twin's Action Model).

1.  **Task Initialization:** A task for the Twin Agent is defined by two primary components:
    *   A `starting URL`: The webpage where the agent begins its work.
    *   A `goal`: A natural language instruction describing what the agent needs to accomplish.
2.  **Execution Environment:** Tasks are executed in secure, remote browser sessions controlled by Twin.so with specialized Kubernetes infrastructure maintaining latency below 50-100ms even at high volumes.
3.  **The Twin Model - Multimodal Understanding and Action:** This is the core AI powering the agent. It's enhanced by OpenAI's CUA model and optimized for customer use cases:
    *   **Perceive Web Environments:** Understand the layout, elements (buttons, forms, text), and context of a wide variety of websites and web applications.
    *   **Decide Optimal Actions:** Based on the current state of the web environment and the overall `goal`, the model determines the most appropriate next action.
    *   **Translate to Browser Instructions:** The model's decision is translated into machine-readable instructions that are then executed in the remote browser.
4.  **Performance Evolution:** Twin has dramatically improved over three generations:
    *   **Twin A1:** 35s latency/step, $1.10 cost/step, 54% accuracy
    *   **Twin A2:** 19s latency/step, $0.15 cost/step, 68% accuracy  
    *   **Twin A3:** 6s latency/step, $0.03 cost/step, 84% accuracy
5.  **Collaboration with Leading Models:** Twin leverages OpenAI's CUA model and collaborates with OpenAI's research team to improve capabilities for specific customer use cases.
6.  **Output Generation:** Upon completing the task, the agent returns an output with structured results, summaries, or confirmations of task completion.

### Getting Started with Twin.so for Tallyfy Integration

<Steps>

1.  **Access Twin.so Platform:**
    *   Contact Twin.so for enterprise access or explore their platform capabilities through their website. Twin.so focuses on enterprise partnerships rather than self-service onboarding.

2.  **Understand Enterprise Integration:**
    *   Twin.so typically works directly with enterprise customers to build specialized agents tailored to specific industry needs and workflows.

3.  **Obtain API Access:**
    *   For direct API integration with Tallyfy, work with Twin.so's team to establish API access and understand their integration patterns.

4.  **Secure Credentials Setup:**
    *   Use Twin.so's **Vaults** feature to securely store credentials for websites that your automated tasks will need to access. The agent can then use these vaulted credentials via your `access key`.

5.  **Identify Tallyfy Tasks for Automation:**
    *   Review your Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) and identify specific [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) that involve repetitive web browser interactions suitable for Twin.so's capabilities.

6.  **Define Integration Architecture:**
    *   Work with Twin.so's team to architect the integration, which may involve:
        *   **Twin API:** Direct API calls from Tallyfy webhooks or middleware
        *   **Custom Webhooks:** Twin.so calling back to Tallyfy upon task completion
        *   **Enterprise Connectors:** Purpose-built integrations for specific use cases

</Steps>

### How Tallyfy Integrates with Twin.so (Example Scenario)

**Tallyfy Task:** "Fetch Monthly Invoice from OpenAI for Expense Report"

*   **Inputs from Tallyfy [Form Fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/):**
    *   `Service Provider`: OpenAI
    *   `Invoice Month`: February 2025
    *   `Expected Amount`: $92.10
    *   `Login Credentials Vault`: (Reference to Twin.so secure vault)
*   **Integration Steps (Enterprise API):**
    1.  When this Tallyfy task becomes active, a Tallyfy webhook triggers an API call to Twin.so.
    2.  The API call to Twin.so would be to `Start Task` with parameters like:
        *   `starting_url`: `https://platform.openai.com/account/billing` 
        *   `goal`: "Log into OpenAI using vaulted credentials. Navigate to billing section. Find and download the invoice for February 2025 with amount $92.10. If not found, report as 'Invoice not available'."
        *   `access_key`: Reference to securely stored OpenAI credentials.
    3.  Twin.so agent executes the task in their enterprise browser infrastructure.
    4.  The Tallyfy integration monitors task completion through Twin.so's API or webhook callbacks.
    5.  Once the Twin.so task is complete, the API response includes:
        *   Task status (e.g., "completed", "failed").
        *   Retrieved invoice file or download link.
        *   Structured data about the invoice (amount, date, invoice number).
    6.  The integration updates the Tallyfy task with the invoice attachment and extracted data, allowing the process to continue to expense report generation.
