## RPA vs. computer AI agents

RPA and Computer AI Agents both automate tasks - but they're worlds apart in what they can do. Pick the wrong one and you'll either burn money on overkill or spend every Monday fixing broken scripts. Tallyfy orchestrates both types, so understanding the difference matters.

**What to notice:**
- Simple decision point: structured tasks go to RPA, unstructured go to AI Agents
- Both paths lead to task completion but through different methods
- Tallyfy orchestrates the choice and tracks the results

:::warning[Important guidance for AI agent tasks]
Your step-by-step instructions for the AI agent to perform work go into the Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) description. **Start with short, bite-size and easy tasks that are just mundane and tedious.** Do not try and ask an AI agent to do huge, complex decision-driven jobs that are goal-driven - they are prone to indeterministic behavior, hallucination, and it can get very expensive quickly. Think "fill out this specific form" not "overhaul our entire customer service."

### Robotic process automation (RPA): the rule-follower

RPA bots copy what humans do on computers - but only for repetitive, rule-based work. Think of RPA as that coworker who follows directions perfectly but freezes when anything unexpected happens.

*   **Core function:** Automates high-volume, predictable tasks based on defined rules and structured inputs.
*   **Data handling:** Built for **structured data** - spreadsheets, databases, or standardized forms.
*   **How it works:** Bots interact with UIs or APIs by following developer-defined steps (e.g., "Open app X, click button Y at coordinates (100,250), copy from field Z, paste into app A").
*   **Adaptability:** RPA is **not adaptive**. Move a button 10 pixels? The bot breaks. Rename a field? Broken. Anyone who's maintained RPA bots knows that Monday-morning feeling of 47 error notifications.
*   **Decision making:** Limited to simple IF/THEN rules (e.g., "IF field X = 'Approved', do Y, ELSE do Z"). Can't handle uncertainty or complex judgment.
*   **Cognitive skill:** Low. Follows instructions literally without understanding the *intent* behind actions.
*   **Best suited for:**
    *   Legacy system integration where APIs aren't available
    *   High-volume data entry or migration between systems with fixed UIs
    *   Form filling with consistent layouts
    *   Standardized report generation from structured sources
*   **Tallyfy integration:** Tallyfy can trigger RPA bots for specific [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) within a larger [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). A Tallyfy task could tell an RPA bot to pull data from [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) and enter it into a legacy mainframe. Tallyfy manages the process flow, provides inputs, and tracks completion.

### Computer AI agents: the adaptive problem-solver

Computer AI Agents (also called Agentic AI or Computer Use Agents) are a different beast entirely. They use Large Language Models to understand language and computer vision to "see" what's on screen - much more human-like than RPA.

*   **Core function:** Automates complex, changing tasks that need context, interpretation of varied inputs (including unstructured data), planning, and decision-making toward a goal.
*   **Data handling:** Processes both **structured and unstructured data** - emails, web pages, PDFs, on-screen elements, and natural language instructions.
*   **How it works:** You give a goal in plain language (e.g., "Find the contact details for the main distributor of Product X in Germany and update their CRM record"). The agent then plans and executes - browsing the web, finding UI elements, filling forms, and typing text.
*   **Adaptability:** AI Agents are **much more adaptive**. They understand what elements mean, not just where they sit. Button moved? They'll find it. "Submit" changed to "Send"? They get it. It's like having an intern who can think instead of memorizing click coordinates.
*   **Decision making:** Makes context-aware decisions, handles uncertainty, and re-plans when hitting obstacles.
*   **Cognitive skill:** Higher. Interprets instructions, understands context, and works toward goals rather than running a fixed click sequence.
*   **Best suited for:**
    *   Dynamic web apps or sites with frequently changing UIs
    *   Extracting information from unstructured sources (e.g., scraping varied product pages)
    *   Tasks requiring interpretation of on-screen information
    *   Open-ended research and data gathering from web sources
    *   Handling exceptions in a process flow
*   **Tallyfy integration:** Tallyfy defines a task goal (e.g., "Log into the supplier portal for Supplier Y, find all POs from last month for 'Project Alpha', and extract totals and delivery dates") and provides input data. The AI Agent carries out the web interactions. Tallyfy makes this a **Trackable AI** step - managing inputs, expected outputs, and human oversight within the overall process.

### Key differences at a glance

| Feature                    | Robotic Process Automation (RPA)             | Computer AI Agents                             |
| :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Intelligence**   | Rule-based execution                         | AI-driven understanding, reasoning, perception |
| **Task Complexity**        | Simple, repetitive, high-volume              | Complex, dynamic, goal-oriented, multi-step    |
| **Adaptability to Change** | Low (brittle, breaks with UI changes)        | High (can adapt to UI/content variations)      |
| **Data Handling**          | Primarily Structured                         | Structured & Unstructured, visual              |
| **Setup & Maintenance**    | Explicit programming, high maintenance       | Goal definition (often NL), potentially lower maintenance for UI changes |
| **Error Handling**         | Requires pre-defined exception paths         | Can attempt to self-correct or re-plan         |
| **Cognitive Load**         | Automates manual execution                   | Automates tasks requiring some interpretation  |

### The shift toward agentic workflows

*   **Agentic workflows:** AI Agents plan, execute, and adapt to hit a goal. RPA just follows its script line by line.
*   **Accessible automation:** You can tell AI Agents what to do in plain English - no coding required. Tools like Microsoft Copilot Studio and OpenAI Operator are making automation available to everyone, not just developers.

### How Tallyfy orchestrates both

Stable, high-volume tasks? Use RPA. Messy, real-world web interactions? AI Agents. Either way, Tallyfy gives you the framework to manage it:

*   **Clear process definition:** Document every step - whether human, RPA, or AI Agent.
*   **Input/output management:** Feed structured data to your automations and capture results in Tallyfy [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/).
*   **Human-in-the-loop:** Add human checkpoints for review and approval. When RPA hits an exception or AI makes a big call, humans step in.
*   **Trackable AI:** Every automated action is visible and accountable. Monitor performance and improve over time.
*   **Mixed automation:** Combine humans, RPA bots, and AI Agents in one workflow. Example: AI Agent does web research, passes data to RPA for legacy system entry, humans approve the results. Tallyfy manages all the handoffs.

### Limitations and the human element

Computer AI Agents aren't perfect. They still make mistakes, misread instructions, and get confused by edge cases. Impressive - but not magic (yet).

That's why Tallyfy's human oversight matters. Design workflows with human checkpoints for critical decisions or external actions. You get AI automation's speed while keeping control where it counts.

The bottom line: it's not RPA vs. AI Agents. The smartest approach uses both. RPA handles the predictable stuff. AI Agents tackle dynamic web interactions that would break your RPA scripts. Tallyfy orchestrates the whole show.
