## RPA vs. computer AI agents: choosing the right automation for Tallyfy

You need to understand the difference between RPA and Computer AI Agents if you're serious about automation. Both can automate tasks, sure - but they're worlds apart in what they can actually do. Tallyfy orchestrates both types, but here's the thing: pick the wrong tool and you'll either burn money on overkill solutions or spend every Monday fixing broken scripts.

```d2
TallyfyInputs: "Tallyfy Process" {
T1: "Task Type"
T2: "Input Data"
T3: "Rules/Goals"
}
Decision: "Automation Choice" {
D1: "Structured?" {shape: diamond}
D2: "RPA Bot"
D3: "AI Agent"
}
RPAFlow: "RPA Processing" {
R1: "Follow Script"
R2: "Fixed Actions"
R3: "Binary Logic"
}
AIFlow: "AI Processing" {
A1: "Understand Goal"
A2: "Adapt to UI"
A3: "Smart Decisions"
}
Results: "Tallyfy Output" {
O1: "Task Complete"
O2: "Data Captured"
O3: "Audit Trail"
}
T1 -> D1
T2 -> D1
T3 -> D1
D1 -> D2: "Yes"
D1 -> D3: "No"
D2 -> R1
R1 -> R2
R2 -> R3
D3 -> A1
A1 -> A2
A2 -> A3
R3 -> O1

```

**What to notice:**
- Tallyfy determines whether to use RPA (for structured tasks) or AI Agents (for dynamic tasks)
- RPA follows rigid scripts while AI Agents adapt to achieve goals
- Both automation types feed results back into Tallyfy for tracking and continuation

:::warning[Important guidance for AI agent tasks]
Your step-by-step instructions for the AI agent to perform work go into the Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) description. **Start with short, bite-size and easy tasks that are just mundane and tedious.** Do not try and ask an AI agent to do huge, complex decision-driven jobs that are goal-driven - they are prone to indeterministic behavior, hallucination, and it can get very expensive quickly. Think "fill out this specific form" not "revolutionize our customer service."

### Robotic process automation (RPA): the rule-follower

RPA uses software "bots" that copy what humans do on computers - but only if it's repetitive and rule-based. Think of RPA as that coworker who follows directions perfectly but completely freezes when anything unexpected pops up. Zero improvisation skills.

*   **Core Function:** Automates high-volume, stable, and predictable tasks based on clearly defined rules and structured data inputs.
*   **Data Handling:** Mainly built for **structured data** â€“ information organized in a consistent format (e.g., data in spreadsheets, databases, or standardized forms).
*   **How it Works:** RPA bots work with application user interfaces (UIs) or existing APIs by following a sequence of steps clearly defined by a developer (e.g., "Open application X, click button Y at coordinates (100,250), copy data from field Z, paste into application A, field B").
*   **Adaptability & Resilience:** RPA is **not adaptive** - period. Move a button 10 pixels? The bot breaks. Rename a field? Broken. Change the data format slightly? You guessed it. Anyone who's maintained RPA bots knows that sinking feeling when you check your email Monday morning and see 47 error notifications.
*   **Decision Making:** Limited to simple, binary decisions based on pre-programmed rules (e.g., "IF field X contains 'Approved', THEN do Y, ELSE do Z"). It can't handle uncertainty, interpret subtle information, or make complex judgments.
*   **Cognitive Skill:** Low. RPA follows instructions literally and doesn't understand the *intent* behind the actions or the content it processes.
*   **Best Suited For:**
    *   Legacy system integration where APIs aren't available.
    *   Stable, high-volume data entry, validation, or migration between systems with fixed UIs.
    *   Regular form filling with consistent layouts.
    *   Creating standardized reports from structured data sources.
*   **Tallyfy Integration:** Tallyfy can start RPA bots for specific, well-defined [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in a larger [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). For example, a Tallyfy task could tell an RPA bot to take data from Tallyfy [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) and put it into an old mainframe system. Tallyfy manages the overall process flow, provides inputs, and tracks the completion and output of the RPA task.

### Computer AI agents: the adaptive problem-solver

Computer AI Agents (you'll also hear them called AI Agents, Agentic AI, or Computer Use Agents) are a whole different beast. They use artificial intelligence - specifically Large Language Models for understanding language and computer vision to actually "see" what's on screen. Much more human-like.

*   **Core Function:** Automates more complex, often changing tasks that may need understanding context, interpreting varied inputs (including unstructured data), planning, and making decisions to reach a specific goal.
*   **Data Handling:** Can process both **structured and unstructured data** (e.g., text from emails, content on web pages, information in PDFs, on-screen visual elements, natural language instructions).
*   **How it Works:** Users usually give a goal, often in natural language (e.g., "Find the contact details for the main distributor of Product X in Germany and update their record in our web CRM"). The AI agent then uses its understanding of language and its ability to "see" and interpret a screen to create and execute a plan. This might involve web browsing, opening applications, dynamically finding and working with UI elements (buttons, forms), and typing text.
*   **Adaptability & Resilience:** AI Agents are **much more adaptive**. They handle UI changes like a pro because they understand what elements mean, not just where they are. Button moved? No problem - they'll find it. Text changed from "Submit" to "Send"? They get it. It's like having an intern who can actually think instead of just memorizing click coordinates.
*   **Decision Making:** Can make more complex, context-aware decisions. They can figure out meaning, handle some uncertainty, and plan or re-plan if they hit obstacles, aiming to reach the overall goal.
*   **Cognitive Skill:** Higher. AI agents try to interpret instructions, understand context, and reach goals, rather than just running a fixed sequence of clicks and keystrokes. They can do tasks that need some cognitive work.
*   **Best Suited For:**
    *   Working with dynamic web applications or websites with frequently changing UIs.
    *   Getting information from unstructured or semi-structured sources (e.g., scraping data from multiple varied product pages).
    *   Tasks needing interpretation of on-screen information and visual context.
    *   More open-ended research, data gathering, or summary tasks from web sources.
    *   Handling exceptions or changes in a process flow more smartly.
*   **Tallyfy Integration:** Tallyfy defines a task goal (e.g., "Log into the supplier portal for Supplier Y, navigate to order history, find all POs from last month related to 'Project Alpha', and extract their total amounts and delivery dates.") and provides necessary input data. The Computer AI Agent then carries out these web interactions. Tallyfy ensures this is a **Trackable AI** step, managing the inputs, expected outputs, and its role within the end-to-end process, allowing for human oversight and intervention if needed.

### Key differences: beyond surface-level automation

| Feature                    | Robotic Process Automation (RPA)             | Computer AI Agents                             |
| :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------- |
| **Primary Intelligence**   | Rule-based execution                         | AI-driven understanding, reasoning, perception |
| **Task Complexity**        | Simple, repetitive, high-volume              | Complex, dynamic, goal-oriented, multi-step    |
| **Adaptability to Change** | Low (brittle, breaks with UI changes)        | High (can adapt to UI/content variations)      |
| **Data Handling**          | Primarily Structured                         | Structured & Unstructured, visual              |
| **Setup & Maintenance**    | Explicit programming, high maintenance       | Goal definition (often NL), potentially lower maintenance for UI changes |
| **Error Handling**         | Requires pre-defined exception paths         | Can attempt to self-correct or re-plan         |
| **Cognitive Load**         | Automates manual execution                   | Automates tasks requiring some interpretation  |

### The shift towards agentic workflows and democratized automation

*   **Agentic Workflows:** AI Agents create "agentic workflows" - they can plan, execute, and adapt over time to hit a goal. RPA? It just follows its script line by line.
*   **Democratization of Automation:** Here's what's exciting: you can tell AI Agents what to do in plain English. No coding required. Microsoft Copilot Studio, OpenAI Operator - they're making automation accessible to everyone, not just developers. Finally, automation that doesn't need a Computer Science degree.

### Tallyfy: orchestrating the evolving automation landscape

Tallyfy sits perfectly in the middle of this automation evolution. Got stable, high-volume tasks? Use RPA. Need something that can handle messy, real-world web interactions? That's where AI Agents shine. Either way, Tallyfy gives you the framework to manage it all:

*   **Clear Process Definition:** Document every step, whether human, RPA, or AI Agent executed.
*   **Input/Output Management:** Provide structured data to your automations and capture their results in Tallyfy [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/).
*   **Human-in-the-Loop:** Seamlessly add human checkpoints for review and approval. When RPA hits an exception or when AI makes a big decision, humans step in. Simple.
*   **Trackable AI:** Every automated action is visible and accountable. You can monitor performance and improve over time - that's core to how Tallyfy works.
*   **Intelligent Process Automation (IPA):** Mix and match humans, RPA bots, and AI Agents in one workflow. Example: AI Agent does web research, passes data to RPA for legacy system entry, humans approve the results. Tallyfy manages all the handoffs.

### Limitations & the human element

Let's be real: Computer AI Agents aren't perfect. They're advancing fast, but they still make mistakes, misread instructions, or get confused by weird edge cases. They're impressive, but not magic (yet).

That's exactly why Tallyfy's human oversight features matter so much. You design workflows with human checkpoints - especially for critical decisions or external actions. Get the benefits of AI automation while keeping control where it counts.

Here's the bottom line: it's not RPA vs. AI Agents. The smartest approach uses both. RPA handles the boring, predictable stuff. AI Agents tackle the dynamic web interactions that would have your RPA scripts crying for mercy. Tallyfy orchestrates the whole show.
