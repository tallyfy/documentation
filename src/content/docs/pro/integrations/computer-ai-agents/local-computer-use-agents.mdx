## Running Computer Use Agents completely offline with Tallyfy

AI automation just hit a turning point. Cloud-based Computer Use Agents like OpenAI's Operator show impressive capabilities, but here's the thing - the future is **Local Computer Use Agents**. These AI systems run entirely on your own hardware. Complete privacy. Zero latency. No token costs.

Tallyfy leads this revolution. We're developing solutions that let organizations deploy Computer Use Agents locally on properly equipped laptops and computers. This breakthrough solves every major limitation of cloud agents: privacy concerns, internet dependency, API costs, and those frustrating latency issues.

:::warning[Important guidance for local AI agent tasks]
Your step-by-step instructions for the local AI agent to perform work go into the Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) description. **Start with short, bite-size and easy tasks that are just mundane and tedious.** Do not try and ask an AI agent to do huge, complex decision-driven jobs that are goal-driven - they are prone to indeterministic behavior, hallucination, and it can get very expensive quickly.

## Why local Computer Use Agents matter for business

Local Computer Use Agents shift everything from cloud dependency to edge intelligence. A recent KPMG survey found that **65% of companies are experimenting with AI agents**, with the workflow automation market reaching **$12.8 billion by 2025**. Yet most worry about sending sensitive screen data to external services. Local agents fix this.

```d2
Inputs[Tallyfy Task Inputs]: {
I1: "Step Instructions"
I2: "Input Data"
I3: "Security Rules"
}
LocalAgent[Local AI Agent]: {
L1: "Load Local Model"
L2: "Process Locally"
L3: "No Cloud Calls"
L4: "Execute Actions"
L5: "Verify Locally"
}
Outputs[Tallyfy Results]: {
O1: "Action Results"
O2: "Performance Metrics"
O3: "Local Logs"
}
I1 -> L1
I2 -> L2
I3 -> L2
L1 -> L2
L2 -> L3
L3 -> L4
L4 -> L5
L5 -> L2: "Loop"
L5 -> O1
L4 -> O2
L5 -> O3
```

**What to notice:**
- All processing happens locally - no data leaves your infrastructure
- Tallyfy provides instructions and rules while maintaining complete privacy
- Results and metrics are captured locally before being sent back to Tallyfy

**The compelling advantages of local deployment:**

- **Complete Privacy**: Your screen captures, business data, and automation workflows never leave your premises. No cloud servers process your sensitive information.
- **Zero Latency**: Direct hardware execution eliminates network delays, providing instant response times that feel natural and responsive.
- **No Token Costs**: Once deployed, local agents operate without per-use charges. Heavy automation workloads become economically viable.
- **Offline Operation**: Agents continue working without internet connectivity, ensuring business continuity in any environment.
- **Data Sovereignty**: Full control over AI model behavior, data processing, and security compliance requirements.

**Understanding the trade-offs:**

Local agents aren't perfect. You'll need decent hardware - enough VRAM and processing power to run these models. Current local models achieve 85-95% of cloud model performance. But here's what's exciting: rapid improvements in model efficiency and hardware optimization are closing this gap fast.

## How Local Computer Use Agents work

Local Computer Use Agents use a sophisticated multi-component architecture. They replicate and enhance cloud capabilities while running entirely on your hardware.

### Core architecture components

**1. Vision-Language Model (The "Brain")**
At the heart sits a multimodal AI model that processes screenshots and generates action instructions. Modern local models like DeepSeek-R1, Qwen3, and Llama 4 have reached impressive capability levels. DeepSeek-R1 hits 85.8% performance on WebVoyager benchmarks - and that's running locally.

**2. Screen Capture and Processing**
The agent continuously captures screenshots of your computer interface, processes them through OCR and visual analysis, and feeds this visual context to the AI model. Advanced implementations use accessibility APIs for deeper system integration.

**3. Action Execution Engine**
This component translates the AI model's decisions into actual computer interactions - mouse movements, clicks, keyboard input, and application control. Modern implementations combine vision-based universal control with OS-specific automation frameworks for maximum reliability.

**4. Orchestration Framework**
The controlling loop that manages the perception-reasoning-action cycle, handles errors, implements safety measures, and provides the interface between Tallyfy and the local agent.

### The agent execution cycle

Local Computer Use Agents operate through a continuous perception-reasoning-action loop that enables intelligent task completion:

```d2
Act: "Act"
Observe: "Observe"
Perceive: "Perceive"
Reason: "Reason"
Start: "Start"
Start: ""Agent Starts""
Perceive: ""Perceive Screen""
Reason: ""Reason About Task""
Act: ""Execute Action""
Observe: ""Observe Result""
Check: "Goal Achieved?" {shape: diamond}
End: ""Task Complete""
Start -> Perceive
Perceive -> Reason
Reason -> Act
Act -> Observe
Observe -> Check
Check -> : ""No"" Perceive
Check -> : ""Yes"" End
click Perceive "/products/pro/integrations/computer-ai-agents/index/" "Learn about computer AI agents"
click Act "/products/pro/integrations/computer-ai-agents/index/" "Computer AI agents overview"
```

**What to notice:**
- The cycle runs continuously with 2-8 second iterations depending on hardware and model size
- Each step uses specific architectural components (VLM for perception, Action Engine for execution, Orchestration Framework for reasoning)
- The agent only exits the loop when the goal is achieved or a stopping condition is met

1. **Perceive**: Capture current screen state and extract relevant information
2. **Reason**: Process visual context and task instructions to plan next action  
3. **Act**: Execute planned action on the computer interface
4. **Observe**: Capture result and determine if goal is achieved
5. **Iterate**: Continue cycle until task completion or stopping condition

This cycle runs continuously. Modern local models process each iteration in 2-8 seconds (depends on your hardware and model size).

### Technical implementation details

The technical implementation of local Computer Use Agents involves several sophisticated components working in harmony:

**Memory Architecture and Quantization:**
Modern local agents use advanced quantization strategies to optimize memory usage:

```python
# Example memory estimation for local models
def estimate_vram_usage(params_billion, quantization_bits=4, context_length=4096):
    """
    Estimate VRAM usage for local Computer Use Agent models
    
    Args:
        params_billion: Model parameters in billions
        quantization_bits: Quantization level (4, 8, 16)
        context_length: Maximum context window
    
    Returns:
        Estimated VRAM usage in GB
    """
    # Base model size
    model_size_gb = (params_billion * quantization_bits) / 8
    
    # KV cache size (varies by architecture)
    kv_cache_size_gb = (context_length * params_billion * 0.125) / 1024
    
    # Operating overhead
    overhead_gb = 1.5
    
    total_vram = model_size_gb + kv_cache_size_gb + overhead_gb
    return round(total_vram, 2)

# Example calculations for popular models
models = {
    "deepseek-r1:8b": 8,
    "llama4:109b": 109, 
    "qwen3:32b": 32,
    "phi4:14b": 14
}

for model, params in models.items():
    vram_q4 = estimate_vram_usage(params, 4)
    vram_q8 = estimate_vram_usage(params, 8)
    print(f"{model}: {vram_q4}GB (Q4) | {vram_q8}GB (Q8)")
```

**Action Execution Architecture:**
Local agents implement sophisticated action execution through multiple approaches:

1. **Vision-based Universal Control**: Using PyAutoGUI, SikuliX, or OS-native automation APIs
2. **Deep OS Integration**: Leveraging Windows UI Automation, macOS Accessibility API, or Linux AT-SPI
3. **Hybrid Execution**: Combining both approaches for maximum reliability and precision

- Invoice date range: Previous month
- Expected data fields: Invoice number, amount, due date

Local Agent Execution:
1. Navigate to supplier portal
2. Perform secure login using stored credentials  
3. Navigate to invoice section
4. Filter by date range
5. Extract invoice data using OCR and form recognition
6. Structure data according to Tallyfy field requirements
7. Handle any CAPTCHAs or verification prompts

Output to Tallyfy:
- Structured invoice data in designated form fields
- PDF downloads attached to process
- Completion status and execution log

```python
# Example optimization strategies for resource management
class ResourceOptimizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model_cache = {}
        self.quantization_levels = {
            "high_quality": 8,
            "balanced": 4, 
            "aggressive": 2
        }
    
    def optimize_for_hardware(self, available_vram_gb: int):
        """Select optimal model configuration based on available resources"""
        if available_vram_gb >= 24:
            return {
                "model_size": "32b",
                "quantization": "high_quality",
                "batch_size": 4,
                "kv_cache": "q8_0"
            }
        elif available_vram_gb >= 12:
            return {
                "model_size": "8b", 
                "quantization": "balanced",
                "batch_size": 2,
                "kv_cache": "q4_0"
            }
        else:
            return {
                "model_size": "1.5b",
                "quantization": "aggressive", 
                "batch_size": 1,
                "kv_cache": "q2_k"
            }
    
    def dynamic_model_loading(self, task_complexity: str):
        """Load appropriate model based on task requirements"""
        model_mapping = {
            "simple": "phi4:14b",
            "moderate": "qwen3:8b", 
            "complex": "deepseek-r1:32b"
        }
        return model_mapping.get(task_complexity, "qwen3:8b")
```

**Accuracy and Error Handling:**
AI agents still misclick or misinterpret interfaces sometimes. You need robust verification and error recovery:

```python
# Error handling and verification framework
class AgentVerificationSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.action_history = []
        self.verification_strategies = []
    
    def verify_action_result(self, intended_action: str, screenshot_before: str, 
                           screenshot_after: str) -> bool:
        """Verify if the intended action was successful"""
        # Template matching verification
        if self._template_match_verification(intended_action, screenshot_after):
            return True
            
        # Text detection verification  
        if self._text_detection_verification(intended_action, screenshot_after):
            return True
            
        # UI state change verification
        if self._ui_state_change_verification(screenshot_before, screenshot_after):
            return True
            
        return False
    
    def implement_rollback(self, steps_back: int = 1):
        """Rollback failed actions and retry with alternative approach"""
        for _ in range(steps_back):
            if self.action_history:
                last_action = self.action_history.pop()
                self._execute_reverse_action(last_action)
```

**Safety and Boundaries:**
Local agents have the same power as human users. That means comprehensive safety measures are essential:

```python
# Safety framework for local agent deployment
class AgentSafetyFramework:
    def __init__(self):
        self.restricted_actions = [
            "delete_file", "format_drive", "send_email", 
            "financial_transaction", "system_shutdown"
        ]
        self.approval_required = [
            "file_deletion", "email_sending", "payment_processing"
        ]
    
    def safety_check(self, proposed_action: str) -> dict:
        """Comprehensive safety validation before action execution"""
        result = {
            "allowed": True,
            "requires_approval": False,
            "risk_level": "low",
            "restrictions": []
        }
        
        # Check against restricted actions
        if any(restriction in proposed_action.lower() 
               for restriction in self.restricted_actions):
            result["allowed"] = False
            result["risk_level"] = "high"
            
        # Check if approval required
        if any(approval in proposed_action.lower() 
               for approval in self.approval_required):
            result["requires_approval"] = True
            result["risk_level"] = "medium"
            
        return result
    
    def sandbox_execution(self, agent_task: str):
        """Execute agent in sandboxed environment"""
        # Virtual machine isolation
        # Limited file system access
