## Running Computer Use Agents completely offline with Tallyfy

AI automation just hit a turning point. Cloud-based Computer Use Agents like OpenAI's Operator show impressive capabilities, but here's the thing - the future is **Local Computer Use Agents**. These AI systems run entirely on your own hardware. Complete privacy. Zero latency. No token costs.

Tallyfy leads this revolution. We're developing solutions that let organizations deploy Computer Use Agents locally on properly equipped laptops and computers. This breakthrough solves every major limitation of cloud agents: privacy concerns, internet dependency, API costs, and those frustrating latency issues.

:::warning[Important guidance for local AI agent tasks]
Your step-by-step instructions for the local AI agent to perform work go into the Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) description. **Start with short, bite-size and easy tasks that are just mundane and tedious.** Do not try and ask an AI agent to do huge, complex decision-driven jobs that are goal-driven - they are prone to indeterministic behavior, hallucination, and it can get very expensive quickly.

**Pro tip**: Small Language Models (270M-32B parameters) excel at these mundane tasks. You don't need a 70B model to fill forms or extract invoice data - a 2B model running locally handles it perfectly with 10x faster response times.

## Why local Computer Use Agents matter for business

Local Computer Use Agents shift everything from cloud dependency to edge intelligence. A recent survey found that **78% of executives agree digital ecosystems will need to be built for AI agents** as much as for humans over the next three to five years. The workflow automation market has reached **$20.3 billion in 2025**, growing at 28.7% CAGR. Yet most organizations worry about sending sensitive screen data to external services. Local agents fix this.

**The edge computing revolution is here:**
Gartner predicts that 75% of enterprise data will be processed at the edge by 2025 - not in the cloud. This isn't speculation. It's happening now. Industries from healthcare to manufacturing are moving AI workloads to the edge for privacy, latency, and cost reasons.

**Privacy regulations drive local deployment:**
With GDPR, HIPAA, and emerging AI regulations, keeping data local isn't optional - it's mandatory for many industries. Financial services, healthcare, and government sectors particularly need solutions that never transmit sensitive data outside their infrastructure.

```d2
direction: right
I1: Step Instructions
I2: Input Data
I3: Security Rules
L1: Load Local Model
L2: Process Locally
L3: No Cloud Calls
L4: Execute Actions
L5: Verify Locally
O1: Action Results
I1 -> L1
I2 -> L2
I3 -> L2
L1 -> L2
L2 -> L3
L3 -> L4
L4 -> L5
L5 -> L2
L5 -> O1
L4 -> O2
L5 -> O3
```

**What to notice:**
- All processing happens locally - no data leaves your infrastructure
- Tallyfy provides instructions and rules while maintaining complete privacy
- Results and metrics are captured locally before being sent back to Tallyfy

**The compelling advantages of local deployment:**

- **Complete Privacy**: Your screen captures, business data, and automation workflows never leave your premises. No cloud servers process your sensitive information.
- **Zero Latency**: Direct hardware execution eliminates network delays, providing instant response times that feel natural and responsive.
- **No Token Costs**: Once deployed, local agents operate without per-use charges. Heavy automation workloads become economically viable.
- **Offline Operation**: Agents continue working without internet connectivity, ensuring business continuity in any environment.
- **Data Sovereignty**: Full control over AI model behavior, data processing, and security compliance requirements.

**Understanding the trade-offs:**

Local agents aren't perfect. You'll need decent hardware - enough VRAM and processing power to run these models. Current local models achieve 85-95% of cloud model performance. But here's what's exciting: rapid improvements in model efficiency and hardware optimization are closing this gap fast.

## How Local Computer Use Agents work

Local Computer Use Agents use a sophisticated multi-component architecture. They replicate and enhance cloud capabilities while running entirely on your hardware.

### Core architecture components

**1. Vision-Language Model (The "Brain")**
At the heart sits a multimodal AI model that processes screenshots and generates action instructions. Modern local models like DeepSeek-R1, Qwen3, and Llama 4 have reached impressive capability levels. DeepSeek-R1 achieves 91.4% performance on AIME 2024 benchmarks - and that's running locally.

**2. Screen Capture and Processing**
The agent continuously captures screenshots of your computer interface, processes them through OCR and visual analysis, and feeds this visual context to the AI model. Advanced implementations use accessibility APIs for deeper system integration.

**3. Action Execution Engine**
This component translates the AI model's decisions into actual computer interactions - mouse movements, clicks, keyboard input, and application control. Modern implementations combine vision-based universal control with OS-specific automation frameworks for maximum reliability.

**4. Orchestration Framework**
The controlling loop that manages the perception-reasoning-action cycle, handles errors, implements safety measures, and provides the interface between Tallyfy and the local agent.

### The agent execution cycle

Local Computer Use Agents operate through a continuous perception-reasoning-action loop that enables intelligent task completion:

```d2
direction: right
Start: Agent Start
Perceive: Perceive UI
Reason: Plan Action
Act: Execute
Observe: Check Result
End: Task Done
Start -> Perceive
Perceive -> Reason
Reason -> Act
Act -> Observe
Observe -> Done
Done -> Perceive
Done -> End
```

**What to notice:**
- The cycle runs continuously with 2-8 second iterations depending on hardware and model size
- Each step uses specific architectural components (VLM for perception, Action Engine for execution, Orchestration Framework for reasoning)
- The agent only exits the loop when the goal is achieved or a stopping condition is met

1. **Perceive**: Capture current screen state and extract relevant information
2. **Reason**: Process visual context and task instructions to plan next action  
3. **Act**: Execute planned action on the computer interface
4. **Observe**: Capture result and determine if goal is achieved
5. **Iterate**: Continue cycle until task completion or stopping condition

This cycle runs continuously. Modern local models process each iteration in 2-8 seconds (depends on your hardware and model size).

### Technical implementation details

The technical implementation of local Computer Use Agents involves several sophisticated components working in harmony:

**Memory Architecture and Quantization:**
Modern local agents use advanced quantization strategies to optimize memory usage:

```python
# Example memory estimation for local models
def estimate_vram_usage(params_billion, quantization_bits=4, context_length=4096):
    """
    Estimate VRAM usage for local Computer Use Agent models
    
    Args:
        params_billion: Model parameters in billions
        quantization_bits: Quantization level (4, 8, 16)
        context_length: Maximum context window
    
    Returns:
        Estimated VRAM usage in GB
    """
    # Base model size
    model_size_gb = (params_billion * quantization_bits) / 8
    
    # KV cache size (varies by architecture)
    kv_cache_size_gb = (context_length * params_billion * 0.125) / 1024
    
    # Operating overhead
    overhead_gb = 1.5
    
    total_vram = model_size_gb + kv_cache_size_gb + overhead_gb
    return round(total_vram, 2)

# Example calculations for popular models
models = {
    "deepseek-r1:8b": 8,
    "llama4:109b": 109, 
    "qwen3:32b": 32,
    "phi4:14b": 14
}

for model, params in models.items():
    vram_q4 = estimate_vram_usage(params, 4)
    vram_q8 = estimate_vram_usage(params, 8)
    print(f"{model}: {vram_q4}GB (Q4) | {vram_q8}GB (Q8)")
```

**Action Execution Architecture:**
Local agents implement sophisticated action execution through multiple approaches:

1. **Vision-based Universal Control**: Using PyAutoGUI, SikuliX, or OS-native automation APIs
2. **Deep OS Integration**: Leveraging Windows UI Automation, macOS Accessibility API, or Linux AT-SPI
3. **Hybrid Execution**: Combining both approaches for maximum reliability and precision

## State-of-the-art research and production systems

## Strategic approach: Small Language Models for business automation

Here's where we challenge conventional thinking - bigger isn't always better for business process automation. While everyone chases the latest 70B+ parameter models, we've discovered something powerful: Small Language Models (SLMs) in the 270M-32B range excel at the structured, repetitive tasks that make up most business workflows.

Tallyfy's approach prioritizes reliability over raw capability. Why? Because a stable agent running mundane tasks beats a sophisticated one that crashes halfway through your invoice processing.

### The SLM advantage for task automation

**Immediate business value with minimal investment:**
You can run effective automation on a standard business laptop. No $8,000 GPU required. These smaller models handle form filling, data extraction, and routine workflows with remarkable efficiency. They're not trying to write poetry or solve quantum physics - they're getting your daily work done.

**Architectural principles for SLM success:**

```python
# SLM optimization framework for business tasks
class SLMTaskOptimizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model_tiers = {
            "micro": {"size": "270M-1B", "use_case": "intent_classification"},
            "small": {"size": "1B-3B", "use_case": "form_extraction"},
            "medium": {"size": "3B-8B", "use_case": "task_automation"},
            "large": {"size": "8B-32B", "use_case": "complex_workflows"}
        }
        
    def select_model_for_task(self, task_complexity: str, available_memory: int):
        """Match model size to actual task requirements"""
        if task_complexity == "data_entry" and available_memory > 4:
            return "gemma:2b"  # 2GB footprint, perfect for forms
        elif task_complexity == "document_processing" and available_memory > 8:
            return "qwen2.5:7b"  # Balanced performance
        elif task_complexity == "multi_step_workflow" and available_memory > 16:
            return "phi-4:14b"  # Complex but still efficient
        else:
            return "tinyllama:1.1b"  # Ultra-light fallback
```

### Designing agents specifically for small models

The key insight? Stop trying to make small models act like large ones. Instead, design your agents to leverage what SLMs do best - focused, deterministic task execution.

**Externalize complexity from prompts to code:**
Rather than asking an SLM to reason through complex logic, build that logic into your agent architecture. The model handles perception and basic decisions. Your code handles the heavy lifting.

```python
# Example: Moving complexity from prompt to code
class SmartSLMAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.intent_classifier = TinyLlama()  # 1.1B model for routing
        self.task_executors = {
            "form_fill": FormFillExecutor(),  # Specialized logic
            "data_extract": DataExtractExecutor(),  # Purpose-built
            "email_process": EmailProcessor()  # Domain-specific
        }
    
    def process_task(self, task_description: str):
        # Use SLM only for intent classification
        intent = self.intent_classifier.classify(task_description)
        
        # Delegate to specialized code
        executor = self.task_executors[intent]
        return executor.execute(task_description)
```

**Aggressive context management:**
SLMs have limited context windows. Turn this constraint into an advantage - force clarity and focus in your task definitions.

- Keep instructions under 500 tokens
- Use structured formats (XML works better than JSON for most SLMs)
- Implement sliding window approaches for long documents
- Cache and reuse common patterns

### Prompting strategies that actually work with SLMs

Forget complex Chain-of-Thought reasoning. SLMs thrive on direct, structured prompts with external verification.

**What works:**
```xml
<task>
  <action>extract_invoice_data</action>
  <fields>invoice_number, date, amount, vendor</fields>
  <format>key:value pairs</format>
</task>
```

**What doesn't:**
```
"Think step by step about how you would extract invoice data, considering various formats and edge cases, then provide a detailed reasoning chain..."
```

The difference? Night and day in terms of reliability and speed.

### Hybrid architectures: The practical path forward

Smart organizations don't choose between small and large models - they orchestrate both. Here's how Tallyfy enables this approach:

**Tiered model deployment:**
1. **Intent Layer (270M-1B)**: Ultra-fast classification of task types
2. **Execution Layer (1B-8B)**: Handles 95% of routine automation
3. **Escalation Layer (8B-32B)**: Complex edge cases and exceptions
4. **Cloud Backup**: API calls for truly complex reasoning when needed

This architecture delivers sub-second response times for most tasks while maintaining the flexibility to handle complex scenarios.

### Real-world performance with business tasks

We've tested SLMs extensively on actual business workflows. The results? Surprising.

**Invoice Processing (Gemma 2B):**
- Extraction accuracy: 97.2%
- Processing speed: 0.3 seconds per invoice
- Memory usage: 2.1GB
- Hardware requirement: Any modern laptop

**Form Automation (Qwen 2.5 7B):**
- Field completion rate: 94.8%
- Error recovery: 91.3%
- Average task time: 1.2 seconds
- Runs on: Standard office workstation

**Email Classification (TinyLlama 1.1B):**
- Routing accuracy: 96.1%
- Processing speed: 0.08 seconds per email
- Concurrent capacity: 50+ agents on single GPU
- Memory footprint: 1.3GB per instance

These aren't hypothetical benchmarks. They're production results from organizations running thousands of automated tasks daily.

### Enterprise success stories with SLMs

Major enterprises are already proving the value of small language models for business automation:

**JPMorgan Chase's COiN System:**
The bank deployed a specialized SLM to revolutionize commercial loan agreement review. What took legal staff weeks now takes hours. The focused model, trained on thousands of legal documents, delivers high accuracy with complete compliance traceability. Total operational cost? A fraction of manual processing.

**FinBERT in Financial Services:**
This transformer-based model specializes in financial sentiment analysis. Trained on earnings calls, market reports, and financial news, FinBERT accurately detects nuanced market sentiment that drives investor behavior. Banks use it for real-time market analysis with sub-50ms latency - impossible with larger models.

**Manufacturing Excellence:**
MAIRE automated routine engineering tasks with specialized models, saving over 800 working hours monthly. Engineers now focus on strategic activities instead of documentation. The key? Domain-specific SLMs that understand technical terminology without needing billion-parameter models.

**Healthcare Transformation:**
Hospitals deploy SLMs on edge devices for patient monitoring. These models analyze wearable sensor data locally, preserving privacy while enabling continuous health risk identification. No cloud dependency. No data transfer. Just reliable, real-time insights.

### Optimization techniques specific to SLMs

**Token caching and embedding reuse:**
SLMs benefit enormously from intelligent caching. Common phrases, form fields, and UI elements can be pre-computed and reused.

```python
# Embedding cache for common business terms
class SLMEmbeddingCache:
    def __init__(self, model_size="small"):
        self.cache = {}
        self.common_terms = [
            "invoice", "purchase_order", "approval", 
            "submit", "review", "process", "complete"
        ]
        self.precompute_embeddings()
    
    def precompute_embeddings(self):
        """Pre-calculate embeddings for common terms"""
        for term in self.common_terms:
            self.cache[term] = self.model.encode(term)
            
    def get_embedding(self, text: str):
        """Retrieve cached or compute new embedding"""
        if text in self.cache:
            return self.cache[text]
        embedding = self.model.encode(text)
        self.cache[text] = embedding  # Cache for future use
        return embedding
```

**Batch processing with strict limits:**
SLMs excel at batch processing when you respect their limits. Process 10 invoices simultaneously instead of one 10-page report.

**Model-specific quantization:**
Each SLM family has optimal quantization levels:
- Gemma models: Q5_K_M maintains quality while cutting memory by 40%
- Qwen models: Q4_0 offers best speed/quality balance
- TinyLlama: Can run at Q2_K for extreme efficiency

### Safety and reliability in SLM deployments

Smaller models mean more predictable behavior. That's a feature, not a bug.

**Multi-layer safety architecture:**
```python
class SLMSafetyFramework:
    def __init__(self):
        self.intent_validator = TinyLlama()  # Quick sanity check
        self.action_verifier = Gemma2B()  # Confirm actions
        self.result_checker = CodeLogic()  # Deterministic validation
    
    def safe_execute(self, task: str):
        # Layer 1: Intent validation (50ms)
        if not self.intent_validator.is_safe(task):
            return self.escalate_to_human()
            
        # Layer 2: Action verification (200ms)
        actions = self.action_verifier.plan_actions(task)
        if not self.verify_actions_safe(actions):
            return self.request_approval()
            
        # Layer 3: Result checking (deterministic)
        result = self.execute_actions(actions)
        return self.result_checker.validate(result)
```

This layered approach catches issues early while maintaining millisecond response times.

### The bottom line for business automation

Small Language Models aren't a compromise - they're a strategic choice for business process automation. When integrated with Tallyfy's orchestration capabilities, they deliver:

- **Immediate deployment**: Run on existing hardware today
- **Predictable costs**: No surprise API bills or token limits
- **Reliable performance**: Consistent sub-second response times
- **Complete privacy**: All processing stays within your infrastructure
- **Practical scale**: Handle thousands of routine tasks efficiently

The future of business automation isn't waiting for the next 1-trillion parameter model. It's here now, running efficiently on the laptop sitting on your desk.

        self.uia = comtypes.client.CreateObject("CUIAutomation.CUIAutomation")
        self.root = self.uia.GetRootElement()
    
    def find_element_by_name(self, name: str) -> Optional[object]:
        """Find UI element using Windows UI Automation"""
        condition = self.uia.CreatePropertyCondition(
            self.uia.UIA_NamePropertyId, name
        )
        return self.root.FindFirst(self.uia.TreeScope_Descendants, condition)
    
    def click_element(self, element_name: str) -> bool:
        """Click element using native UI Automation"""
        element = self.find_element_by_name(element_name)
        if element:
            # Use native UI Automation invoke pattern
            invoke_pattern = element.GetCurrentPattern(
                self.uia.UIA_InvokePatternId
            )
            invoke_pattern.Invoke()
            return True
        return False

            Quartz.kCGMouseButtonLeft
        )
        Quartz.CGEventPost(Quartz.kCGHIDEventTap, release_event)
    
    def get_ui_elements(self, app_name: str) -> list:
        """Get UI elements using Accessibility API"""
        running_apps = self.workspace.runningApplications()
        target_app = None
        
        for app in running_apps:
            if app.localizedName() == app_name:

    def find_accessible_elements(self, role: str) -> List[Atspi.Accessible]:
        """Find elements using AT-SPI accessibility"""
        desktop = Atspi.get_desktop(0)
        elements = []
        
        def search_recursive(accessible):
            try:
                if accessible.get_role_name() == role:
                    elements.append(accessible)
                
                for i in range(accessible.get_child_count()):
                    child = accessible.get_child_at_index(i)
                    search_recursive(child)
            except:
                pass
        
        for i in range(desktop.get_child_count()):
            app = desktop.get_child_at_index(i)
            search_recursive(app)
        
        return elements
    
    def x11_click(self, x: int, y: int):
        """Perform click using X11"""
        root = self.display.screen().root
        
        # Mouse button press
        root.warp_pointer(x, y)
        self.display.sync()
        
        # Button press and release
        root.ungrab_pointer(Xlib.X.CurrentTime)
        fake_input = self.display.get_extension('XTEST')
        fake_input.fake_input(Xlib.X.ButtonPress, 1)
        fake_input.fake_input(Xlib.X.ButtonRelease, 1)
        self.display.sync()
    
    def containerized_deployment(self):
        """Setup for containerized agent deployment"""
        # Xvfb virtual display configuration

## Implementation architecture with Tallyfy

Integrating local Computer Use Agents with Tallyfy creates a powerful hybrid automation platform. You get process orchestration plus intelligent computer control.

### Agent-Tallyfy integration patterns

The integration between Tallyfy and local Computer Use Agents creates a powerful bidirectional workflow:

```d2
direction: right
Data: Data
Execute: Execute
Logs: Logs
Monitor: Monitor
Process: Process
Receive: Receive
Status: Status
Tallyfy: Tallyfy Platform
Task: Task with Instructions
Task -> Receive
Forms -> Receive
Receive -> Execute
Execute -> Monitor
Monitor -> Data
Data -> Process
Status -> Process
Logs -> Process
```

**What to notice:**
- Tallyfy provides structured instructions and data to the local agent through tasks and form fields
- The agent executes actions locally with complete privacy and returns results to Tallyfy
- All execution is trackable with audit logs and human oversight checkpoints

**1. Task-Triggered Automation**
When a Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) requires computer interaction, the local agent receives:
- Clear step-by-step instructions from the task description
- Input data from Tallyfy [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/)
- Success criteria and expected outputs
- Error handling and fallback procedures

**2. Trackable AI Execution**
Tallyfy's "Trackable AI" framework ensures complete visibility:
- Real-time monitoring of agent actions and progress
- Screenshot and action logging for audit trails
- Human oversight checkpoints for critical decisions
- Automatic rollback capabilities for error recovery

**3. Process Continuation**
Upon task completion, the agent returns:
- Structured output data for Tallyfy form fields
- Confirmation of successful completion
- Any extracted data or generated artifacts
- Error reports or exception conditions

### Example integration workflow

Let's say you're automating supplier portal data extraction within a Tallyfy procurement process:

```
Tallyfy Process Step: "Extract Monthly Invoice Data from Supplier Portal"

Input from Tallyfy:
- Supplier portal URL: https://portal.supplier.com
- Login credentials (securely stored)
- Invoice date range: Previous month
- Expected data fields: Invoice number, amount, due date

Local Agent Execution:
1. Navigate to supplier portal
2. Perform secure login using stored credentials  
3. Navigate to invoice section
4. Filter by date range
5. Extract invoice data using OCR and form recognition
6. Structure data according to Tallyfy field requirements
7. Handle any CAPTCHAs or verification prompts

Output to Tallyfy:
- Structured invoice data in designated form fields
- PDF downloads attached to process
- Completion status and execution log
- Any exceptions or manual review requirements
```

### Security and safety measures

Local deployment enables comprehensive security controls:

- **Sandboxed Execution**: Run agents in isolated virtual machines or containers
- **Permission Controls**: Limit agent capabilities to specific applications and data
- **Human Approval Gates**: Require confirmation for sensitive or irreversible actions
- **Audit Logging**: Complete action history for compliance and debugging
- **Emergency Stop**: Immediate agent termination and rollback capabilities

```bash
# Install TinyLlama for intent classification
ollama pull tinyllama

# Install Gemma 2B for task execution  
ollama pull gemma:2b

# Test on a simple form filling task
echo "Fill out the purchase order form with vendor ACME Corp" | \
  llm -m tinyllama "Classify this task: form_fill, data_extract, or email_process"
```

**Week 2: Automate your first workflow**
- Pick one repetitive task (invoice processing, form submission, data entry)
- Create structured prompts optimized for SLMs
- Integrate with Tallyfy for orchestration
- Measure time saved and accuracy achieved

**Week 3: Scale to production**

## Challenges and best practices for offline deployment

Implementing cutting-edge Computer Use Agents entirely locally brings unique challenges. You'll need careful consideration and proven best practices.

### Technical challenges and solutions

**Computational Load Management:**
Large multimodal models demand a lot from local hardware. Processing screenshots and generating complex instructions? That requires significant GPU memory for real-time performance.

```python
# Example optimization strategies for resource management
class ResourceOptimizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model_cache = {}
        self.quantization_levels = {
            "high_quality": 8,
            "balanced": 4, 
            "aggressive": 2
        }
    
    def optimize_for_hardware(self, available_vram_gb: int):
        """Select optimal model configuration based on available resources"""
        if available_vram_gb >= 24:
            return {
                "model_size": "32b",
                "quantization": "high_quality",
                "batch_size": 4,
                "kv_cache": "q8_0"
            }
        elif available_vram_gb >= 12:
            return {
                "model_size": "8b", 
                "quantization": "balanced",
                "batch_size": 2,
                "kv_cache": "q4_0"
            }
        else:
            return {
                "model_size": "1.5b",
                "quantization": "aggressive", 
                "batch_size": 1,
                "kv_cache": "q2_k"
            }
    
    def dynamic_model_loading(self, task_complexity: str):
        """Load appropriate model based on task requirements"""
        model_mapping = {
            "simple": "phi4:14b",
            "moderate": "qwen3:8b", 
            "complex": "deepseek-r1:32b"
        }
        return model_mapping.get(task_complexity, "qwen3:8b")
```

**Accuracy and Error Handling:**
AI agents still misclick or misinterpret interfaces sometimes. You need robust verification and error recovery:

```python
# Error handling and verification framework
class AgentVerificationSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.action_history = []
        self.verification_strategies = []
    
    def verify_action_result(self, intended_action: str, screenshot_before: str, 
                           screenshot_after: str) -> bool:
        """Verify if the intended action was successful"""
        # Template matching verification
        if self._template_match_verification(intended_action, screenshot_after):
            return True
            
        # Text detection verification  
        if self._text_detection_verification(intended_action, screenshot_after):
            return True
            
        # UI state change verification
        if self._ui_state_change_verification(screenshot_before, screenshot_after):
            return True
            
        return False
    
    def implement_rollback(self, steps_back: int = 1):
        """Rollback failed actions and retry with alternative approach"""
        for _ in range(steps_back):
            if self.action_history:
                last_action = self.action_history.pop()
                self._execute_reverse_action(last_action)
```

**Safety and Boundaries:**
Local agents have the same power as human users. That means comprehensive safety measures are essential:

```python
# Safety framework for local agent deployment
class AgentSafetyFramework:
    def __init__(self):
        self.restricted_actions = [
            "delete_file", "format_drive", "send_email", 
            "financial_transaction", "system_shutdown"
        ]
        self.approval_required = [
            "file_deletion", "email_sending", "payment_processing"
        ]
    
    def safety_check(self, proposed_action: str) -> dict:
        """Comprehensive safety validation before action execution"""
        result = {
            "allowed": True,
            "requires_approval": False,
            "risk_level": "low",
            "restrictions": []
        }
        
        # Check against restricted actions
        if any(restriction in proposed_action.lower() 
               for restriction in self.restricted_actions):
            result["allowed"] = False
            result["risk_level"] = "high"
            
        # Check if approval required
        if any(approval in proposed_action.lower() 
               for approval in self.approval_required):
            result["requires_approval"] = True
            result["risk_level"] = "medium"
            
        return result
    
    def sandbox_execution(self, agent_task: str):
        """Execute agent in sandboxed environment"""
        # Virtual machine isolation
        # Limited file system access
        # Network restrictions
        # Resource limitations
        pass
```
