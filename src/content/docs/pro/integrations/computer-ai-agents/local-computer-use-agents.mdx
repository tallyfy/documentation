## Running Computer Use Agents completely offline with Tallyfy

The revolution in AI automation has reached a pivotal moment. While cloud-based Computer Use Agents like OpenAI's Operator have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, the future belongs to **Local Computer Use Agents** - sophisticated AI systems that run entirely on your own hardware, providing complete privacy, zero latency, and unlimited usage without token costs.

Tallyfy is at the forefront of this revolution, developing cutting-edge solutions that enable organizations to deploy Computer Use Agents locally on suitably powered laptops and computers. This breakthrough eliminates the fundamental limitations of cloud-based agents: data privacy concerns, internet dependency, API costs, and latency issues.

:::warning[Important guidance for local AI agent tasks]
Your step-by-step instructions for the local AI agent to perform work go into the Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) description. **Start with short, bite-size and easy tasks that are just mundane and tedious.** Do not try and ask an AI agent to do huge, complex decision-driven jobs that are goal-driven - they are prone to indeterministic behavior, hallucination, and it can get very expensive quickly.

## Why local Computer Use Agents matter for business

Local Computer Use Agents represent a paradigm shift from cloud dependency to edge intelligence. Recent industry analysis shows that **65% of companies are experimenting with AI agents**, yet most remain concerned about sending sensitive screen data to external services. Local agents solve this fundamental challenge.

**The compelling advantages of local deployment:**

- **Complete Privacy**: Your screen captures, business data, and automation workflows never leave your premises. No cloud servers process your sensitive information.
- **Zero Latency**: Direct hardware execution eliminates network delays, providing instant response times that feel natural and responsive.
- **No Token Costs**: Once deployed, local agents operate without per-use charges. Heavy automation workloads become economically viable.
- **Offline Operation**: Agents continue working without internet connectivity, ensuring business continuity in any environment.
- **Data Sovereignty**: Full control over AI model behavior, data processing, and security compliance requirements.

**Understanding the trade-offs:**

While local agents offer unprecedented advantages, they do require consideration of hardware requirements and accuracy expectations. Current local models achieve 85-95% of cloud model performance while requiring adequate VRAM and processing power. However, rapid improvements in model efficiency and hardware optimization are quickly closing this gap.

## How Local Computer Use Agents work

Local Computer Use Agents operate through a sophisticated multi-component architecture that replicates and enhances the capabilities of cloud-based systems while running entirely on your hardware.

### Core architecture components

**1. Vision-Language Model (The "Brain")**
At the core is a multimodal AI model that processes screenshots and generates action instructions. Modern local models like DeepSeek-R1, Qwen3, and Llama 4 have reached remarkable capability levels - with DeepSeek-R1 achieving 85.8% performance on WebVoyager benchmarks while running locally.

**2. Screen Capture and Processing**
The agent continuously captures screenshots of your computer interface, processes them through OCR and visual analysis, and feeds this visual context to the AI model. Advanced implementations use accessibility APIs for deeper system integration.

**3. Action Execution Engine**
This component translates the AI model's decisions into actual computer interactions - mouse movements, clicks, keyboard input, and application control. Modern implementations combine vision-based universal control with OS-specific automation frameworks for maximum reliability.

**4. Orchestration Framework**
The controlling loop that manages the perception-reasoning-action cycle, handles errors, implements safety measures, and provides the interface between Tallyfy and the local agent.

### The agent execution cycle

1. **Perceive**: Capture current screen state and extract relevant information
2. **Reason**: Process visual context and task instructions to plan next action  
3. **Act**: Execute planned action on the computer interface
4. **Observe**: Capture result and determine if goal is achieved
5. **Iterate**: Continue cycle until task completion or stopping condition

This cycle operates continuously, with modern local models processing each iteration in 2-8 seconds depending on hardware configuration and model size.
