## The gap Teams can't fill

Microsoft Teams is where your team communicates. But communication isn't process.

When someone asks "can you approve this?" in a Teams message, there's no assigned owner, no deadline, no escalation. If that message gets buried in a busy channel, the work simply doesn't happen. Teams can't track whether a request was completed or hold anyone accountable.

Teams Approvals (built on Power Automate) handles simple linear approvals - but it can't manage multi-step processes with conditional routing, parallel tasks, or cross-department coordination.

**What Teams handles:**

- Real-time messaging and channels
- Video meetings and calls
- File sharing via SharePoint
- Basic approvals via Power Automate

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Request tracking with clear ownership and deadlines
- Multi-department approval workflows
- SLA enforcement and automatic escalation
- Process visibility and completion metrics
- Conditional routing based on request type or data
- Audit trails for compliance

Teams is where people talk. Tallyfy is where work gets tracked and done.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

When a request comes in through Teams, Tallyfy creates a structured workflow with assigned owners, deadlines, and escalation rules. Every step is tracked - nothing gets lost in chat history.

### Request management

Turn Teams messages into tracked work:
- Convert any message into a Tallyfy task with one click
- Launch structured workflows from slash commands
- Collect request details via forms before creating work
- Link Teams conversations to Tallyfy tasks for context

### Process execution

Complete workflows without leaving Teams:
- Receive task notifications in your activity feed
- Approve or reject requests directly from Teams
- Post workflow status updates to channels automatically
- Track progress across all your assigned work

### Team coordination

Pair Teams collaboration with structured workflows:
- New channel creation triggers project setup workflows
- Guest access triggers compliance and security reviews
- Document uploads trigger review and approval processes
- Meeting action items become tracked Tallyfy tasks
