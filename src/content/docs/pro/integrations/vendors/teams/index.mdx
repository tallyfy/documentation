## Quick Summary

We're integrating with Microsoft Teams to bring structured workflows directly into where your teams already work. Instead of switching between Teams for communication and other tools for processes, Tallyfy workflows live inside Teams - triggered by messages, completed in channels, and tracked without leaving your collaboration space.

<Aside type="tip" title="Native Platform Integration">
Microsoft Teams offers comprehensive APIs through Microsoft Graph, Power Automate integration, and a rich app ecosystem. Custom apps can be built with minimal code using Teams Toolkit.
</Aside>

## Why This Integration Matters

Teams is where work happens - meetings, chats, file sharing, and collaboration. But informal communication often lacks the structure needed for consistent execution. Critical requests get buried in chat. Approvals happen through scattered messages. Processes rely on people remembering what to do.

Our integration transforms Teams from a communication tool into a workflow engine. Start workflows from messages. Complete tasks in channels. Track progress in tabs. All without leaving Teams.

## What We're Building

### Workflow Triggers from Teams

Turn conversations into action:

- **Message-Based Workflows**: React to a message with a workflow emoji to trigger a process
- **Command Workflows**: Type `/tallyfy expense-report` to start workflows
- **Form Workflows**: Adaptive cards in channels collect data and launch workflows  
- **Meeting Workflows**: Action items from meetings automatically become workflows

### Workflow Execution in Teams

Complete work where you communicate:

- **Channel Workflows**: Tasks appear in relevant channels for team completion
- **Personal Tasks**: Individual assignments show in Teams activity feed
- **Approval Flows**: Approve/reject directly from Teams notifications
- **Status Updates**: Workflow progress posts to channels automatically

### Teams-Specific Automations

Leverage Teams collaboration features:

- **Team Provisioning**: New project channels trigger setup workflows
- **Guest Access**: External user additions trigger compliance workflows
- **File Workflows**: Document uploads trigger review/approval processes
- **Meeting Followups**: Recording availability triggers distribution workflows

## How to Connect Today

### Option 1: Microsoft Graph API

Direct integration using Graph API:

```javascript
// Example: Create workflow from Teams message
const handleTeamsMessage = async (context) => {
  // Get message details
  const message = context.activity;
  const teamId = message.channelData.team.id;
  const channelId = message.channelData.channel.id;
  const user = message.from;
  
  // Parse workflow trigger
  if (message.text.includes('@tallyfy')) {
    const workflowType = extractWorkflowType(message.text);
    
    // Create workflow with Teams context
    const workflow = await fetch('https://api.tallyfy.com/v1/workflows', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TALLYFY_KEY',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        template_id: workflowType,
        name: `${workflowType} - ${user.name}`,
        data: {
          requester_name: user.name,
          requester_email: user.aadObjectId,
          team_id: teamId,
          team_name: message.channelData.team.name,
          channel_id: channelId,
          channel_name: message.channelData.channel.name,
          message_content: message.text,
          message_url: `https://teams.microsoft.com/l/message/${channelId}/${message.id}`,
          timestamp: message.timestamp
        }
      })
    });
    
    // Post confirmation to Teams
    await postToTeams(channelId, `âœ… Workflow started: ${workflow.id}`);
  }
};
```

### Option 2: Teams App with Adaptive Cards

Build interactive Teams app:

```javascript
// Adaptive Card for workflow initiation
const workflowCard = {
  type: 'AdaptiveCard',
  body: [
    {
      type: 'TextBlock',
      text: 'Start New Workflow',
      size: 'Large',
      weight: 'Bolder'
    },
    {
      type: 'Input.ChoiceSet',
      id: 'workflowType',
      choices: [
        { title: 'Expense Report', value: 'expense' },
        { title: 'Time Off Request', value: 'timeoff' },
        { title: 'IT Request', value: 'itrequest' }
      ]
    },
    {
      type: 'Input.Text',
      id: 'description',
      placeholder: 'Describe your request',
      isMultiline: true
    }
  ],
  actions: [
    {
      type: 'Action.Submit',
      title: 'Start Workflow',
      data: { action: 'create_workflow' }
    }
  ]
};
```

### Option 3: Power Automate Integration

Use Power Automate for no-code integration:

1. Create Power Automate flow triggered by Teams events
2. Add Tallyfy connector actions
3. Map Teams data to workflow fields
4. Configure approval actions in Teams
5. Set up notifications and updates

### Option 4: Teams Webhook Integration

Simple webhook-based integration:

```javascript
// Incoming webhook to Teams channel
const notifyTeams = async (workflowUpdate) => {
  const teamsWebhookUrl = 'https://outlook.office.com/webhook/YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL';
  
  await fetch(teamsWebhookUrl, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      '@type': 'MessageCard',
      title: 'Workflow Update',
      text: `${workflowUpdate.name} - ${workflowUpdate.status}`,
      potentialAction: [{
        '@type': 'OpenUri',
        name: 'View Workflow',
        targets: [{ uri: workflowUpdate.url }]
      }]
    })
  });
};
```
