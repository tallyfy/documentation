## The gap Square Payroll can't fill

Square Payroll integrates tightly with Square's point-of-sale and payment ecosystem. But Square's merchant focus means cross-department coordination still requires manual work.

When Square Payroll processes a new hire, they appear in the Square system. IT still needs to provision accounts beyond Square. Training needs to schedule orientation. Finance needs expense setup. Those handoffs happen outside Square's ecosystem entirely.

**What Square Payroll manages:**

- Payroll processing for Square merchants
- Time tracking integrated with Square POS
- Benefits administration for small teams
- Tip calculations and distribution

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Cross-department coordination beyond Square
- IT provisioning and system access setup
- Multi-step approval workflows
- Compliance documentation coordination
- Training and onboarding across teams

Square Payroll serves merchants within its ecosystem - but employee processes span every department. Tallyfy coordinates workflows across all your teams, not just one.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

When a Square Payroll event fires - hire, termination, payroll completion - Tallyfy launches a structured workflow that coordinates teams beyond Square's ecosystem.

### Employee onboarding

When Square records a new hire, Tallyfy kicks off:
- IT account setup and equipment provisioning
- Training schedule and compliance tracking
- Finance expense account configuration
- Team introduction workflows

### Shift and labor coordination

When Square tracks labor events, Tallyfy handles:
- Overtime approval workflows
- Compliance verification for breaks and hours
- Multi-location staffing coordination
- Exception routing to managers
