## The gap Square Payroll cannot fill

Square Payroll integrates tightly with Square's point-of-sale and payment ecosystem. But Square's focus on the merchant ecosystem means cross-department coordination requires manual intervention.

When Square Payroll processes a new hire, they appear in the Square system. But IT needs to provision accounts beyond Square. Training needs to schedule orientation. Finance needs expense setup. These cross-department handoffs happen outside Square's ecosystem.

**What Square Payroll manages:**

- Payroll processing for Square merchants
- Time tracking integrated with Square POS
- Benefits administration for small teams
- Tip calculations and distribution

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Cross-department coordination beyond Square
- IT provisioning and system access setup
- Multi-step approval workflows
- Compliance documentation coordination
- Training and onboarding across teams

Square Payroll serves merchants within the Square ecosystem. But employee processes span every department. Tallyfy orchestrates workflows across ALL your teams - not just one.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

When a Square Payroll event fires - hire, termination, payroll completion - Tallyfy launches a structured workflow that coordinates teams beyond the Square ecosystem.

### Employee onboarding

When Square records a new hire, Tallyfy orchestrates:
- IT account setup and equipment provisioning
- Training schedule and compliance tracking
- Finance expense account configuration
- Team introduction workflows

### Shift and labor coordination

When Square tracks labor events, Tallyfy handles:
- Overtime approval workflows
- Compliance verification for breaks and hours
- Multi-location staffing coordination
- Exception routing to managers
