## The gap Kofax cannot fill

Kofax excels at intelligent document capture and process automation - extracting data from invoices, forms, and documents with high accuracy. But documents don't exist in isolation. They're part of broader business processes that require human review, approval chains, and cross-department coordination.

When Kofax extracts invoice data, who approves payment? When it captures a contract, who reviews the terms? When it processes an application, who makes the final decision? Kofax handles document capture and data extraction - the human workflows that surround those documents need separate coordination.

**What Kofax automates:**

- Intelligent document capture and OCR
- Data extraction from structured and unstructured documents
- Document classification and routing
- RPA for document-heavy processes

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Workflow coordination after document capture
- Human review and approval chains
- Exception handling for low-confidence extractions
- Cross-department routing based on document content
- SLA tracking for the full document lifecycle
- Accountability for document processing outcomes

Kofax captures and extracts. Tallyfy orchestrates - coordinating the human activities, approvals, and follow-up actions that transform captured documents into completed business processes.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

Tallyfy serves as the orchestration layer that connects Kofax document processing with human workflows.

### Document workflow orchestration

When Kofax processes documents, Tallyfy:
- Receives extracted data and confidence scores
- Routes low-confidence extractions to human reviewers
- Triggers approval workflows based on document type and content
- Tracks the document through its full lifecycle

### Human review integration

Tallyfy manages document review:
- Kofax flags extraction for review → Tallyfy assigns to specialist
- Reviewer corrects or approves → Tallyfy triggers next steps
- High-confidence extractions skip review → proceed automatically
- Complete audit trail of all decisions

### Post-capture workflows

After Kofax extracts document data, Tallyfy orchestrates:
- Multi-level approval chains
- Cross-department notifications and tasks
- Integration with downstream systems
- Archive and retention workflows
