## The gap ServiceNow can't fill

ServiceNow dominates enterprise ITSM - incident management, change requests, and IT service delivery. But many workflows triggered by IT events involve non-IT teams who don't live in ServiceNow.

When a ServiceNow incident needs procurement action, HR involvement, or facilities coordination - you've got two bad options. Force everyone into ServiceNow (expensive, complex) or lose visibility when work leaves IT.

**What ServiceNow manages:**

- IT incident and problem management
- Change and release management
- IT asset management
- IT service catalog

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Cross-department workflows beyond IT
- Business process coordination for non-IT users
- Simple workflows that don't justify ServiceNow complexity
- Vendor and external party task coordination
- Business approvals outside IT governance
- Operational handoffs to non-technical teams

ServiceNow manages IT workflows. Tallyfy coordinates the business processes that IT events trigger across your organization.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

Tallyfy extends ServiceNow's reach into business processes - without forcing everyone into ITSM complexity.

### Cross-department coordination

When IT events affect other teams, Tallyfy:
- Launches business workflows triggered by ServiceNow
- Assigns tasks to non-IT team members
- Tracks completion without ServiceNow licenses
- Reports status back to IT

### Business process management

For workflows that don't fit ITSM, Tallyfy:
- Handles simple processes without ServiceNow overhead
- Manages business approvals and reviews
- Coordinates vendor and external actions
- Provides lightweight workflow for business teams

### Operational handoffs

When IT work triggers business actions, Tallyfy handles:
- New system onboarding processes
- Security incident response coordination
- Business continuity procedures
- Compliance documentation workflows
