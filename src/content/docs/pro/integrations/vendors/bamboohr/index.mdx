## The gap BambooHR can't fill

BambooHR stores employee data and handles basic HR admin. But it hits an automation ceiling - it can't coordinate the cross-department work that employee changes trigger.

When someone's hired in BambooHR, the system knows their name, department, and start date. It can't tell IT to provision a laptop, notify Facilities to prepare a desk, or schedule orientation. These handoffs happen manually - through emails, spreadsheets, and hoping someone remembers.

**What BambooHR manages:**

- Employee records and personal information
- Time-off tracking and balances
- Basic onboarding task lists
- Performance review scheduling

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Cross-department coordination for IT, Facilities, and Finance
- Multi-step approvals beyond basic manager sign-off
- Visibility into onboarding completion across teams
- Conditional routing based on role, location, or department
- Escalation when tasks are overdue

BambooHR serves your HR team. Employee processes span every department. Tallyfy coordinates workflows across all your teams - not just one.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

When BambooHR records an employee change - new hire, departure, promotion - Tallyfy launches a structured workflow that coordinates every downstream team. Every step has an owner, a deadline, and escalation if it stalls.

### Employee onboarding

When BambooHR adds a new employee, Tallyfy kicks off:
- IT equipment provisioning and account setup
- Facilities workspace and access card preparation
- Training schedule based on role and department
- Finance expense account and payroll validation
- Manager introductions and team onboarding tasks

### Organizational changes

When BambooHR records a promotion or transfer, Tallyfy coordinates:
- Access permission updates across all systems
- Equipment changes for new responsibilities
- Training requirements for the new role
- Announcements and knowledge transfer workflows

### Offboarding

When BambooHR records a departure, Tallyfy ensures:
- IT access revocation across all systems
- Equipment return tracking
- Knowledge transfer completion
- Exit interview and feedback collection
