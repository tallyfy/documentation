## The gap BambooHR cannot fill

BambooHR stores your employee data and handles basic HR administration. But BambooHR has an automation ceiling - it cannot coordinate the cross-department work that employee changes trigger.

When someone is hired in BambooHR, the system knows their name, department, and start date. But it cannot tell IT to provision their laptop. It cannot notify Facilities to prepare their desk. It cannot schedule their orientation or set up their expense account. These handoffs happen manually - through emails, spreadsheets, and hoping someone remembers.

**What BambooHR manages:**

- Employee records and personal information
- Time-off tracking and balances
- Basic onboarding task lists
- Performance review scheduling

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Cross-department coordination for IT, Facilities, and Finance
- Multi-step approval workflows beyond basic manager sign-off
- Real-time visibility into onboarding completion across teams
- Conditional routing based on role, location, or department
- Integration handoffs with payroll and other systems
- Structured escalation when tasks are overdue

BambooHR serves your HR team. But employee processes span every department. Tallyfy orchestrates workflows across ALL your teams - not just one.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

When BambooHR records an employee change - new hire, departure, promotion - Tallyfy launches a structured workflow that coordinates every downstream team. Every step has an owner, a deadline, and escalation if it stalls.

### Employee onboarding

When BambooHR adds a new employee, Tallyfy orchestrates:
- IT equipment provisioning and account setup
- Facilities workspace and access card preparation
- Training schedule based on role and department
- Finance expense account and payroll setup validation
- Manager introduction and team integration tasks

### Organizational changes

When BambooHR records a promotion or transfer, Tallyfy coordinates:
- Access permission updates across all systems
- Equipment changes for new responsibilities
- Training requirements for the new role
- Announcement and knowledge transfer workflows

### Offboarding

When BambooHR records a departure, Tallyfy ensures:
- IT access revocation across all systems
- Equipment return tracking
- Knowledge transfer completion
- Exit interview and feedback collection
