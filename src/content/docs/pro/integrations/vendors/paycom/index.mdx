## The gap Paycom cannot fill

Paycom provides single-database HCM with payroll, HR, and talent management in one platform. But when employee events trigger cross-department coordination, manual processes take over.

Paycom's single-database approach centralizes HR data. But IT still needs separate notifications for account provisioning. Facilities needs alerts for workspace setup. Training needs to coordinate schedules. These cross-department handoffs happen outside Paycom's walls.

**What Paycom manages:**

- Single-database payroll and HR
- Talent acquisition and management
- Time and labor management
- Employee self-service

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Cross-department process coordination
- IT provisioning beyond Paycom's ecosystem
- Equipment ordering and delivery tracking
- Multi-stakeholder approval chains
- External vendor and contractor workflows

Paycom centralizes your HR data. But business processes span every department. Tallyfy orchestrates workflows across ALL your teams - not just one.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

When a Paycom employee event occurs - hire, role change, time-off request, departure - Tallyfy launches a structured workflow that coordinates teams beyond the HCM platform.

### Employee onboarding

When Paycom records a new hire, Tallyfy orchestrates:
- IT account and equipment provisioning
- Facilities workspace and access setup
- Training enrollment beyond Paycom LMS
- Finance expense account configuration
- Team introduction workflows

### Payroll coordination

When Paycom processes payroll events, Tallyfy handles:
- Exception approval workflows
- Accounting reconciliation tasks
- Multi-step compensation change approvals
- Audit documentation workflows
