## What ADP Workforce Now can't do

ADP Workforce Now covers HR, payroll, and talent management well. But when employee events happen - a hire, promotion, or termination - the coordination across departments still falls on people.

It won't trigger IT provisioning when someone joins. It won't notify Facilities to set up a workspace. It can't route compensation approvals through multiple departments. Those handoffs happen through email and manual tracking.

**What ADP handles:**

- Payroll and tax services
- HR administration and employee records
- Talent management and recruiting
- Benefits and time management

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Cross-department approval routing for compensation and role changes
- IT and Facilities coordination during onboarding
- Multi-team workflows spanning HR, Finance, and Legal
- Real-time process visibility across the organization
- Escalation when approvals stall

ADP serves your HR team. Tallyfy coordinates workflows across ALL your teams.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

When an ADP event fires, Tallyfy launches a structured workflow with clear ownership, deadlines, and escalation paths.

### Enterprise onboarding

When ADP records a new hire, Tallyfy kicks off:
- IT equipment provisioning and system access
- Facilities workspace and building access
- Compliance training and certification tracking
- Finance expense and corporate card setup
- Security clearance and background check coordination

### Approval workflows

When ADP records changes requiring approval, Tallyfy handles:
- Multi-level compensation change approvals
- Role change routing through HR, Finance, and Legal
- Promotion workflows with budget validation
- Exception handling when approvals are delayed
