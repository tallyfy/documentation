## The gap ADP Workforce Now cannot fill

ADP Workforce Now provides comprehensive HR, payroll, and talent management. But the moment employee events occur, coordination across multiple departments requires manual intervention.

ADP Workforce Now cannot orchestrate IT provisioning when someone is hired. It cannot coordinate Facilities for workspace setup. It cannot route complex approvals through multiple departments for compensation changes. These cross-system handoffs happen through email and manual tracking.

**What ADP Workforce Now manages:**

- Comprehensive payroll and tax services
- HR administration and employee records
- Talent management and recruiting
- Benefits and time management

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Cross-department approval routing for compensation and role changes
- IT and Facilities coordination during onboarding
- Multi-stakeholder workflows spanning HR, Finance, and Legal
- Real-time process visibility across the organization
- Structured escalation when approvals stall

ADP Workforce Now serves your HR organization. But enterprise processes require coordination across every department. Tallyfy orchestrates workflows across ALL your teams - not just one.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

When an ADP Workforce Now event fires - hire, promotion, termination - Tallyfy launches a structured workflow with clear ownership, deadlines, and escalation.

### Enterprise onboarding

When ADP records a new hire, Tallyfy orchestrates:
- IT equipment provisioning and system access
- Facilities workspace and building access
- Compliance training and certification tracking
- Finance expense and corporate card setup
- Security clearance and background check coordination

### Approval workflows

When ADP records changes requiring approval, Tallyfy handles:
- Multi-level compensation change approvals
- Role change routing through HR, Finance, and Legal
- Promotion workflows with budget validation
- Exception handling when approvals are delayed
