## Quick Summary

We're integrating with ADP Workforce Now to transform your comprehensive HR data into intelligent workflows that span your entire organization.

ADP Workforce Now offers extensive API access through API Central, with robust libraries for payroll, HR, time tracking, and benefits. Quick activation and comprehensive developer resources make integration straightforward.

## Why This Integration Matters

ADP Workforce Now manages the full employee lifecycle for mid-size companies, but HR data alone doesn't run your business. Every status change triggers dozens of tasks across departments. Every payroll run needs approvals, allocations, and reporting. Every compliance requirement needs tracking and documentation.

Our integration transforms ADP from a data repository into an automation engine, ensuring every HR event triggers the right workflows across your organization.

## What We're Building

### Enterprise Onboarding Orchestration

Complex onboarding made simple:

- **Multi-Department Coordination**: HR entry in ADP triggers IT provisioning, facilities setup, finance systems, and department-specific workflows
- **Role-Based Complexity**: Different paths for executives, managers, individual contributors, contractors, and interns
- **Compliance Excellence**: Background checks, I-9 verification, license tracking, and certification workflows
- **Progressive Integration**: Day 1, week 1, month 1, and quarter 1 milestone workflows

### Advanced Workforce Management

Beyond basic time and attendance:

- **Complex Approval Chains**: Multi-tier approvals based on amount, type, department, and policy
- **Project Time Allocation**: Automatic distribution to cost centers with variance workflows
- **Shift Management**: Coverage workflows when employees call out or swap shifts
- **Labor Budget Tracking**: Real-time alerts when approaching thresholds

### Comprehensive Compliance Automation

Stay ahead of regulations:

- **Multi-State Compliance**: State-specific workflows for taxes, leave laws, and reporting
- **ACA Management**: Track hours, manage eligibility, and generate required reports
- **Certification Tracking**: Professional licenses, clearances, and training expiry workflows
- **Audit Preparedness**: Automatic documentation collection and organization

  switch(event.eventNameCode) {
    case 'worker.hire':
      await createComprehensiveOnboarding(event.data);
      break;
      
    case 'worker.rehire':
      await createRehireWorkflow(event.data);
      break;
      
    case 'worker.leave.request':
      await createLeaveManagementWorkflow(event.data);
      break;
      
    case 'worker.termination':
      await createOffboardingWorkflow(event.data);
      break;
      
    case 'position.change':
      await createTransferWorkflow(event.data);
      break;
  }
  
  res.status(200).json({ processed: true });
