## What Copper doesn't cover

Copper lives inside Google Workspace - it's a CRM that works directly in Gmail and Google Calendar. It captures relationship data automatically. That's great. But deals need more than relationship tracking - they need coordinated tasks across teams.

When a deal moves forward in Copper, the actual work involves multiple people: solutions architects scoping requirements, finance approving pricing, legal reviewing contracts. Copper captures emails and calendar events - not the structured task sequences that push deals to close.

**What Copper handles:**

- Gmail and Calendar integration
- Automatic contact and activity capture
- Pipeline and deal tracking
- Google Workspace native CRM

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Micro-tasks between each sales stage
- Cross-team coordination beyond email
- Structured approval workflows
- Task assignment with deadlines and accountability
- Post-sale handoffs with Operations
- Audit trails for deal execution

Copper captures what happens in Google Workspace. Tallyfy coordinates the work that happens across your organization.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

Tallyfy connects Copper deal changes with the detailed workflows that need to happen across teams.

### Beyond email coordination

When deals progress in Copper, Tallyfy:
- Launches structured task workflows
- Assigns work to the right people with deadlines
- Tracks completion outside of email threads
- Gives everyone involved real-time visibility

### Structured approvals

When deals need approvals, Tallyfy:
- Routes to the right approvers based on deal type
- Handles multi-level approval chains
- Documents approval history
- Escalates delays automatically

### Post-sale coordination

When deals close in Copper, Tallyfy kicks off:
- Structured customer handoffs
- Implementation workflows
- Account provisioning tasks
- Training and onboarding sequences
