## The gap Copper cannot fill

Copper lives inside Google Workspace - CRM that works directly in Gmail and Google Calendar. This tight integration captures relationship data automatically. But deals require more than relationship tracking - they require coordinated tasks across teams.

When a deal advances in Copper, the work that makes it advance involves multiple people: solutions architects scoping requirements, finance approving pricing, legal reviewing contracts. Copper captures emails and calendar events - but not the structured task sequences that move deals forward.

**What Copper manages:**

- Gmail and Calendar integration
- Automatic contact and activity capture
- Pipeline and deal tracking
- Google Workspace native CRM

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Micro-tasks between each sales stage
- Cross-team coordination beyond email
- Structured approval workflows
- Task assignment with deadlines and accountability
- Post-sale handoffs with Operations
- Audit trails for deal execution

Copper captures what happens in Google Workspace. Tallyfy orchestrates the work that happens across your entire organization.
