## The gap Zenefits can't fill

Zenefits (now TriNet Zenefits) provides all-in-one HR for SMBs - covering benefits, payroll, and compliance. But the moment HR events need cross-department coordination, things fall outside Zenefits' scope.

A new hire gets recorded in Zenefits. Paperwork and benefits enrollment? Handled. But IT still needs to provision accounts. Facilities needs workspace setup. Training needs to schedule onboarding. These cross-department processes need coordination that Zenefits doesn't provide.

**What Zenefits manages:**

- HR administration and employee records
- Benefits administration and enrollment
- Payroll processing
- Compliance documentation

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Cross-department process coordination
- IT provisioning and access management
- Equipment ordering and tracking
- Multi-team approval chains
- External vendor and contractor workflows

Zenefits serves your SMB HR needs - but employee processes span every department. Tallyfy coordinates workflows across ALL your teams, not just one.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

When a Zenefits employee event fires - hire, benefits change, time-off request, departure - Tallyfy launches a structured workflow that coordinates every downstream team.

### Employee onboarding

When Zenefits records a new hire, Tallyfy coordinates:
- IT account setup and equipment provisioning
- Facilities workspace and building access
- Training schedule and compliance tracking
- Finance expense account configuration
- Team introduction workflows

### Benefits coordination

When Zenefits processes benefits changes, Tallyfy handles:
- Multi-step enrollment verification workflows
- Dependent documentation collection
- Payroll deduction confirmations
- Compliance documentation tracking
