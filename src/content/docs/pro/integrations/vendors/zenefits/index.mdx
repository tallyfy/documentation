## The gap Zenefits cannot fill

Zenefits (now TriNet Zenefits) provides all-in-one HR for SMBs - HR, benefits, payroll, and compliance. But the moment HR events trigger cross-department coordination, processes fall outside Zenefits' scope.

When Zenefits records a new hire, the HR system handles paperwork and benefits enrollment. But IT needs to provision accounts. Facilities needs workspace setup. Training needs to schedule onboarding. These cross-department processes require coordination beyond what Zenefits provides.

**What Zenefits manages:**

- HR administration and employee records
- Benefits administration and enrollment
- Payroll processing
- Compliance documentation

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Cross-department process coordination
- IT provisioning and access management
- Equipment ordering and tracking
- Multi-stakeholder approval chains
- External vendor and contractor workflows

Zenefits serves your SMB HR needs. But employee processes span every department. Tallyfy orchestrates workflows across ALL your teams - not just one.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

When a Zenefits employee event fires - hire, benefits change, time-off request, departure - Tallyfy launches a structured workflow that coordinates every downstream team.

### Employee onboarding

When Zenefits records a new hire, Tallyfy orchestrates:
- IT account setup and equipment provisioning
- Facilities workspace and building access
- Training schedule and compliance tracking
- Finance expense account configuration
- Team introduction workflows

### Benefits coordination

When Zenefits processes benefits changes, Tallyfy handles:
- Multi-step enrollment verification workflows
- Dependent documentation collection
- Payroll deduction confirmations
- Compliance documentation tracking
