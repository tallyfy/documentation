## The gap Pipedrive cannot fill

Pipedrive gives sales teams a visual pipeline to track deals. But moving a deal from one stage to the next requires more than dragging a card - it requires coordinated tasks across multiple people that Pipedrive cannot orchestrate.

When a deal moves to "Proposal Sent" in Pipedrive, the proposal itself needed technical input, pricing approval, and legal review. When it moves to "Negotiation," someone needs to track revision requests and approval chains. Pipedrive shows where deals are - not what must happen to move them forward.

**What Pipedrive manages:**

- Visual sales pipeline
- Deal tracking and activities
- Email integration
- Sales reporting

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Micro-tasks required at each stage
- Cross-team coordination for proposals
- Approval workflows for pricing and contracts
- Post-win handoffs to Operations
- Deadline enforcement on internal tasks
- Audit trails for deal execution

Pipedrive tells you a deal is in the proposal stage. Tallyfy ensures the proposal gets created, reviewed, and approved correctly.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

Tallyfy serves as the orchestration layer that connects Pipedrive stage changes with the detailed workflows that must happen at each stage.

### Proposal coordination

When deals reach proposal stage in Pipedrive, Tallyfy:
- Launches proposal development workflows
- Assigns technical scoping to the right engineer
- Routes pricing for approval based on deal size
- Tracks who contributed what and when

### Contract execution

When deals move to negotiation in Pipedrive, Tallyfy:
- Coordinates revision request handling
- Routes contract changes through legal
- Manages approval chains for exceptions
- Ensures nothing falls through cracks

### Win/loss workflows

When deals close in Pipedrive, Tallyfy orchestrates:
- Customer onboarding handoff
- Win review documentation
- Or loss analysis and feedback capture
- Account setup tasks
