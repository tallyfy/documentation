## Integration options

Paylocity offers REST APIs through their developer program. Pick the approach that fits your partnership status and technical needs.

### REST API integration

Use Paylocity's REST API to trigger Tallyfy processes when employee events happen:

```javascript
const handlePaylocityEvent = async (event) => {
  if (event.eventType === 'employee.created') {
    const employee = await paylocityAPI.get(
      `/v2/companies/${companyId}/employees/${event.employeeId}`
    );

    // Launch a Tallyfy process (called a "run") from a template
    const run = await fetch(
      `https://go.tallyfy.com/api/organizations/${orgId}/runs`,
      {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Authorization': `Bearer ${tallyfyToken}`,
          'X-Tallyfy-Client': 'APIClient',
          'Accept': 'application/json',
          'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          checklist_id: 'TEMPLATE_ID_HERE',
          name: `Onboarding - ${employee.firstName} ${employee.lastName}`,
          prerun: {
            employee_id: employee.employeeId,
            full_name: `${employee.firstName} ${employee.lastName}`,
            email: employee.workEmail,
            department: employee.departmentCode,
            location: employee.workLocation,
            job_title: employee.jobTitle,
            manager: `${employee.supervisorFirstName} ${employee.supervisorLastName}`,
            start_date: employee.hireDate
          }
        })
      }
    );

    return run.json();
  }
};
```

### Webhook integration

Register webhooks to get real-time notifications from Paylocity:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const crypto = require('crypto');
const app = express();

app.post('/paylocity-webhook', express.json(), async (req, res) => {
  // Verify webhook signature
  const signature = req.headers['x-paylocity-signature'];
  const payload = JSON.stringify(req.body);
  const expected = crypto
    .createHmac('sha256', process.env.PAYLOCITY_WEBHOOK_SECRET)
    .update(payload)
    .digest('hex');

  if (signature !== expected) {
    return res.status(401).send('Invalid signature');
  }

  const { eventType, data } = req.body;

  switch (eventType) {
    case 'employee.hired':
      await launchOnboardingWorkflow(data);
      break;
    case 'employee.terminated':
      await launchOffboardingWorkflow(data);
      break;
    case 'payroll.completed':
      await launchPayrollReviewWorkflow(data);
      break;
  }

  res.status(200).send('OK');
});
```

## Data mapping

Common Paylocity fields to map to Tallyfy kick-off form variables:

| Paylocity field | Tallyfy variable | Description |
|-----------------|------------------|-------------|
| `employeeId` | `employee_id` | Unique employee identifier |
| `firstName` + `lastName` | `full_name` | Employee full name |
| `workEmail` | `email` | Work email address |
| `departmentCode` | `department` | Department code |
| `costCenter` | `cost_center` | Cost center assignment |
| `workLocation` | `location` | Work location code |
| `jobTitle` | `job_title` | Job title |
| `supervisorFirstName` | `manager` | Direct supervisor |
| `employeeType` | `employee_type` | Full-time, part-time, or contractor |
| `hireDate` | `start_date` | Employee start date |

## Authentication

Paylocity uses OAuth 2.0[^1] with the client credentials flow. Store credentials securely - don't expose them in client-side code.

```javascript
const getPaylocityToken = async () => {
  const response = await fetch(
    'https://api.paylocity.com/IdentityServer/connect/token',
    {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
      },
      body: new URLSearchParams({
        grant_type: 'client_credentials',
        client_id: process.env.PAYLOCITY_CLIENT_ID,
        client_secret: process.env.PAYLOCITY_CLIENT_SECRET,
        scope: 'WebLinkAPI'
      })
    }
  );

  return response.json();
};
```

## iPaaS alternatives

If direct API work isn't an option, consider these platforms:

- **Merge API** - unified HRIS API with Paylocity support
- **Finch** - employment system API with a Paylocity connector
- **Flexspring** - HR integration platform
- **Workato** - enterprise automation recipes
