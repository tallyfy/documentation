## Quick Summary

We're integrating with Paylocity to transform their powerful HCM data into automated workflows that run your entire employee lifecycle. From the moment someone applies to their last day (and beyond), every HR event in Paylocity triggers precisely orchestrated workflows across your organization - no manual handoffs, no dropped balls, no compliance gaps.

<Aside type="note" title="Developer-Friendly Platform">
Paylocity offers open APIs with webhook support and an active developer program. They require either being a customer or having a customer sponsor to access their sandbox, but integration is straightforward once approved.

## Why This Integration Matters

Paylocity excels at core HR and payroll, but your employee processes span far beyond their platform. Every hire needs IT equipment, system access, training schedules, and workspace setup. Every departure requires access revocation, knowledge transfer, and exit procedures.

Today, your HR team manually coordinates these handoffs through emails, spreadsheets, and constant follow-ups. Tomorrow, Paylocity events will automatically trigger Tallyfy workflows that ensure every step happens on time, every time.

## What We're Building

### Intelligent Onboarding Orchestration

Transform new hire chaos into smooth operations:

- **Pre-Boarding Automation**: As soon as someone's entered in Paylocity, launch background checks, equipment ordering, and workspace preparation
- **Day One Readiness**: Pull role, department, and manager data to configure system access, training paths, and team introductions
- **Progressive Onboarding**: Trigger 30/60/90-day check-ins, training milestones, and performance reviews
- **Role-Specific Workflows**: Different paths for sales vs engineering vs operations, automatically determined by Paylocity data

### Dynamic Payroll Workflows

Connect payroll processing to financial operations:

- **Timesheet Intelligence**: Launch approval workflows based on overtime, exceptions, or department thresholds
- **Commission Calculations**: Automate multi-tier commission reviews with proper approvals
- **Garnishment Management**: Handle complex garnishment workflows with legal compliance
- **Multi-State Processing**: Coordinate tax registrations and compliance when employees work across states

### Compliance and Risk Management

Leverage Paylocity data for bulletproof compliance:

- **I-9 and E-Verify**: Track verification deadlines with automated reminders
- **Certification Tracking**: Monitor professional licenses, clearances, and training expiries
- **FMLA Administration**: Orchestrate leave requests, documentation, and return-to-work processes
- **Audit Preparedness**: Maintain complete documentation trails for all HR actions

## How to Connect Today

### Option 1: Paylocity API Integration

Direct integration using Paylocity's REST APIs:

```javascript
// Example: Create onboarding workflow from Paylocity new hire
const initiateOnboarding = async (webhookData) => {
  // Parse Paylocity webhook payload
  const employee = webhookData.employee;
  
  // Create comprehensive onboarding workflow
  const workflow = await fetch('https://api.tallyfy.com/v1/workflows', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TALLYFY_KEY',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      template_id: 'employee_onboarding_advanced',
      name: `Onboarding - ${employee.firstName} ${employee.lastName}`,
      data: {
        // Paylocity employee data
        employee_id: employee.employeeId,
        first_name: employee.firstName,
        last_name: employee.lastName,
        email: employee.workEmail,
        
        // Position details
        job_title: employee.jobTitle,
        department: employee.departmentName,
        reports_to: employee.supervisorName,
        
        // Logistics
        start_date: employee.hireDate,
        location: employee.workLocation,
        remote_status: employee.remoteWorker,
        
        // Compensation (if needed for equipment tiers)
        salary_band: employee.payGrade,
        employee_type: employee.employeeType
      }
    })
  });
  
  return workflow.json();
};
