## The gap Paylocity cannot fill

Paylocity manages your employee records and processes payroll. But the moment someone is hired in Paylocity, a cascade of manual coordination begins that Paylocity doesn't handle.

Paylocity cannot tell IT to order a laptop. It cannot assign desk setup to Facilities. It cannot schedule orientation with Training or notify Finance to create an expense account. These handoffs happen in email threads, spreadsheets, and chat messages - if they happen at all.

**What Paylocity manages:**

- Employee data and personnel records
- Payroll processing and tax compliance
- Benefits administration and enrollment
- Time tracking and attendance

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Cross-department coordination for onboarding and offboarding
- IT equipment provisioning and system access setup
- Multi-team approval chains for role changes and compensation
- Real-time visibility into process completion across departments
- Structured handoffs with clear ownership and deadlines
- Compliance tracking across certification and training requirements

Paylocity serves your HR team. But employee lifecycle processes span every department - IT, Facilities, Training, Finance, and Legal. Tallyfy orchestrates workflows across ALL your teams, not just one.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

When a Paylocity employee event fires - new hire, termination, role change - Tallyfy launches a structured workflow that coordinates every downstream action. Every step has an owner, a deadline, and escalation rules if something stalls.

### Employee onboarding

When Paylocity records a new hire, Tallyfy orchestrates:
- IT equipment ordering and system access provisioning
- Facilities workspace setup and building access
- Training schedule and compliance certification tracking
- Finance expense account and corporate card setup
- Manager introductions and team integration tasks

### Payroll coordination

When Paylocity processes payroll events, Tallyfy handles:
- Exception approval workflows for overtime and adjustments
- Multi-tier commission review and sign-off chains
- Garnishment processing with legal compliance checkpoints
- Multi-state tax registration coordination

### Offboarding

When Paylocity records a termination, Tallyfy ensures:
- IT access revocation on the correct date
- Equipment return tracking and verification
- Knowledge transfer completion before last day
- Exit interview scheduling and feedback collection
