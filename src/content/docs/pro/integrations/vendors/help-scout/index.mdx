## The gap Help Scout cannot fill

Help Scout brings humanity to support - conversations that feel like email, not tickets. This personal touch delights customers. But the conversational model shares the same structural gap as all helpdesk tools: conversations capture discussions, not workflows.

When a Help Scout conversation requires product input, engineering investigation, or cross-team coordination, the thread captures what was said. Help Scout doesn't orchestrate the multi-step workflows needed to fully resolve complex issues.

**What Help Scout manages:**

- Email-like customer conversations
- Shared inboxes with collision detection
- Knowledge base (Docs)
- Customer profiles and history

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Structured workflows from conversations
- Multi-team coordination with accountability
- Internal process triggers from customer needs
- Post-conversation follow-up sequences
- Systematic improvement workflows
- Root cause analysis processes

Help Scout humanizes support conversations. Tallyfy structures the work that makes customers successful beyond the inbox.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

Tallyfy serves as the orchestration layer that connects Help Scout conversations with the structured workflows that deliver complete resolution.

### Beyond the inbox

When conversations need action, Tallyfy:
- Launches structured task workflows
- Assigns work to teams outside support
- Tracks completion with deadlines
- Provides visibility into resolution progress

### Team coordination

When conversations involve multiple teams, Tallyfy:
- Routes tasks to the right departments
- Handles parallel work streams
- Aggregates updates back to support
- Ensures nothing falls through cracks

### Continuous improvement

When patterns emerge from conversations, Tallyfy orchestrates:
- Bug report workflows with engineering
- Feature request evaluation processes
- Documentation improvement workflows
- Training and onboarding updates
