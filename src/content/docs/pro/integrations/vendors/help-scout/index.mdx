## Where Help Scout stops and Tallyfy starts

Help Scout makes support feel personal - conversations that read like email, not tickets. Customers love it. But every helpdesk tool shares the same blind spot: conversations capture what people said, not the work that needs to happen next.

When a Help Scout thread needs product input, an engineering fix, or sign-off from three departments, the conversation records the discussion. It doesn't track the multi-step work required to actually resolve the issue.

**What Help Scout handles well:**

- Email-like customer conversations
- Shared inboxes with collision detection
- Knowledge base (Docs)
- Customer profiles and history

**What slips through:**

- Structured workflows triggered by conversations
- Cross-team coordination with clear accountability
- Internal process kicks from customer needs
- Follow-up sequences after the conversation closes
- Root cause analysis processes

Help Scout keeps support human. Tallyfy structures the behind-the-scenes work that actually gets issues resolved.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

Tallyfy connects Help Scout conversations to the structured workflows that drive full resolution.

### Beyond the inbox

When conversations need action, Tallyfy:
- Launches structured task workflows
- Assigns work to teams outside support
- Tracks completion with deadlines
- Shows resolution progress in real time

### Cross-team coordination

When conversations involve multiple departments, Tallyfy:
- Routes tasks to the right teams
- Runs parallel work streams
- Rolls updates back to support
- Keeps nothing from falling through cracks

### Continuous improvement

When patterns surface from conversations, Tallyfy runs:
- Bug report workflows with engineering
- Feature request evaluation processes
- Documentation update workflows
- Training and onboarding refreshes
