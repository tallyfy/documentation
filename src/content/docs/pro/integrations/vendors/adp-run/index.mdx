## Quick Summary

We're integrating with ADP Run to transform small business payroll data into automated workflows that handle everything from new hire onboarding to tax compliance. When you process payroll, add employees, or manage benefits in ADP Run, Tallyfy automatically orchestrates all related business processes - ensuring accuracy, compliance, and efficiency for your growing business.

<Aside type="note" title="API Central Access">
ADP provides API Central for custom integrations, which can be activated within minutes. However, becoming an ADP Marketplace partner requires approval, making it a gated API for third-party developers.
</Aside>

## Why This Integration Matters

ADP Run simplifies payroll for small businesses, but payroll is just one piece of your operations puzzle. Every new hire needs equipment, training, and accounts beyond just getting paid. Every pay run triggers accounting tasks, tax filings, and reporting needs.

Our integration makes ADP Run data automatically flow into structured workflows, eliminating manual coordination and ensuring nothing falls through the cracks as you grow.

## What We're Building

### Small Business Onboarding

Streamline hiring without the enterprise complexity:

- **Simple Start**: New employee in ADP triggers welcome email, equipment order, and first-day checklist
- **Compliance Made Easy**: I-9 reminders, handbook acknowledgments, and state requirements tracked automatically
- **Role-Based Setup**: Different workflows for different positions - all triggered from ADP Run data
- **First Payroll Prep**: Ensure all setup complete before first pay run

### Payroll Process Automation

Transform payroll from deadline scramble to smooth operation:

- **Pre-Payroll Checks**: Timesheet approval workflows before processing
- **Exception Handling**: Overtime or unusual amounts trigger review workflows
- **Post-Payroll Tasks**: Accounting entries, report distribution, and filing reminders
- **Tax Compliance**: Quarter-end and year-end workflows triggered automatically

### Benefits and Time-Off Management

Coordinate beyond basic tracking:

- **PTO Approvals**: Request workflows with coverage planning
- **Benefits Changes**: Life events trigger enrollment workflows
- **Open Enrollment**: Automated communication and tracking
- **Leave Management**: FMLA and state leave compliance workflows

## How to Connect Today

### Option 1: ADP API Central

Direct integration for ADP Run customers:

```javascript
// Example: Create onboarding workflow from ADP Run
const handleADPNewHire = async (event) => {
  // Get employee details from ADP Run
  const employee = await adpAPI.getWorker(event.workerId);
  
  // Create small business onboarding workflow
  const workflow = await fetch('https://api.tallyfy.com/v1/workflows', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TALLYFY_KEY',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      template_id: 'small_business_onboarding',
      name: `Onboarding - ${employee.legalName.formattedName}`,
      data: {
        // ADP Run employee data
        employee_id: employee.associateOID,
        name: employee.legalName.formattedName,
        email: employee.emails[0].emailUri,
        
        // Job information
        position: employee.workerAssignments[0].jobTitle,
        department: employee.workerAssignments[0].organizationalUnits[0].nameCode,
        
        // Payroll setup
        start_date: employee.workerAssignments[0].hireDate,
        pay_rate: employee.workerAssignments[0].baseRemuneration.hourlyRateAmount,
        
        // Location for compliance
        work_state: employee.workerAssignments[0].workLocation.address.countrySubdivisionLevel1
      }
    })
  });
  
  return workflow.json();
};
```

### Option 2: File-Based Integration

For businesses without API access:

```javascript
// Process ADP Run payroll export
const processADPExport = async (csvFile) => {
  const employees = parseCSV(csvFile);
  
  for (const employee of employees) {
    if (employee.status === 'NEW') {
      // Trigger onboarding workflow
      await createOnboardingWorkflow(employee);
    } else if (employee.status === 'TERMINATED') {
      // Trigger offboarding workflow
      await createOffboardingWorkflow(employee);
    }
  }
};
```

### Option 3: Partner Integrations

Connect through integration platforms:

- **Finch**: Unified employment API with ADP Run support
