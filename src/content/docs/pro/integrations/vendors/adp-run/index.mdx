## What ADP Run can't do

ADP Run handles payroll and basic HR for small businesses. But the moment someone's hired in ADP, manual coordination kicks in across systems that don't talk to each other.

ADP Run can't tell IT to set up email accounts, notify Facilities to prepare a workspace, or trigger training enrollment. Teams end up chasing handoffs between separate portals.

**What ADP Run covers:**

- Payroll processing and tax filing
- Basic employee records
- Time and attendance tracking
- Benefits administration

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Cross-department coordination between HR, IT, and Finance
- Multi-step approval workflows spanning teams
- Real-time visibility into onboarding completion
- Structured handoffs with clear ownership and deadlines

ADP Run covers HR and payroll. But employee processes touch every department. Tallyfy runs workflows across all your teams - not just one.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

When an ADP Run employee event fires - hire, termination, role change - Tallyfy launches a structured workflow that coordinates every downstream action across your organization.

### Employee onboarding

When ADP Run records a new hire, Tallyfy kicks off:
- IT account setup and equipment provisioning
- Facilities workspace and access preparation
- Training schedule and compliance tracking
- Finance expense account configuration

### Offboarding

When ADP Run records a termination, Tallyfy makes sure:
- IT access gets revoked on the correct date
- Equipment return is tracked
- Final payroll coordination happens on time
