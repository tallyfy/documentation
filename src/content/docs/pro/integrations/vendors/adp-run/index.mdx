## The gap ADP Run cannot fill

ADP Run handles payroll processing and basic HR for small businesses. But the moment someone is hired in ADP, a cascade of manual coordination begins across systems that don't talk to each other.

ADP Run cannot tell IT to set up email accounts. It cannot notify Facilities to prepare a workspace. It cannot trigger training enrollment or expense account setup. Teams must manually coordinate these handoffs between separate portals and systems.

**What ADP Run manages:**

- Payroll processing and tax filing
- Basic employee records
- Time and attendance tracking
- Benefits administration

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Cross-department coordination between HR, IT, and Finance
- Portal-switching friction between disconnected systems
- Multi-step approval workflows spanning teams
- Real-time visibility into onboarding completion
- Structured handoffs with clear ownership and deadlines

ADP Run serves your HR and payroll needs. But employee processes span every department. Tallyfy orchestrates workflows across ALL your teams - not just one.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

When an ADP Run employee event fires - hire, termination, role change - Tallyfy launches a structured workflow that coordinates every downstream action across your organization.

### Employee onboarding

When ADP Run records a new hire, Tallyfy orchestrates:
- IT account setup and equipment provisioning
- Facilities workspace and access preparation
- Training schedule and compliance tracking
- Finance expense account configuration

### Offboarding

When ADP Run records a termination, Tallyfy ensures:
- IT access revocation on the correct date
- Equipment return tracking
- Final payroll coordination
