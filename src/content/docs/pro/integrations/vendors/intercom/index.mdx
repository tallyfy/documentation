## The gap Intercom cannot fill

Intercom excels at conversational support - live chat, bots, and messaging that feel natural. But conversations are inherently unstructured. They capture what customers say, not the workflows needed to act on it.

When an Intercom conversation reveals a bug, requires a product change, or needs input from engineering, the chat thread captures the discussion. Intercom doesn't orchestrate the multi-team work that actually resolves the customer's underlying need.

**What Intercom manages:**

- Live chat and messaging
- Bot-driven support automation
- Customer data and segments
- Conversation history and handoffs

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Structured workflows from conversation insights
- Multi-team coordination beyond chat
- Internal process triggers from customer requests
- Post-conversation follow-up workflows
- Feature request tracking with accountability
- Customer success handoffs with clear ownership

Intercom manages the conversation. Tallyfy orchestrates the work that happens after the chat ends.
