description: Tallyfy complements Intercom by providing structured workflow orchestration
  for the multi-team work and follow-up actions that happen after customer conversations
  end since Intercom handles chat and messaging well but cannot coordinate cross-department
  processes or track accountability for feature requests and customer success handoffs.

## The gap Intercom cannot fill

Intercom excels at conversational support - live chat, bots, and messaging that feel natural. But conversations are inherently unstructured. They capture what customers say, not the workflows needed to act on it.

When an Intercom conversation reveals a bug, requires a product change, or needs input from engineering, the chat thread captures the discussion. Intercom doesn't orchestrate the multi-team work that actually resolves the customer's underlying need.

**What Intercom manages:**

- Live chat and messaging
- Bot-driven support automation
- Customer data and segments
- Conversation history and handoffs

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Structured workflows from conversation insights
- Multi-team coordination beyond chat
- Internal process triggers from customer requests
- Post-conversation follow-up workflows
- Feature request tracking with accountability
- Customer success handoffs with clear ownership

Intercom manages the conversation. Tallyfy orchestrates the work that happens after the chat ends.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

Tallyfy serves as the orchestration layer that connects Intercom conversations with the structured workflows that deliver on customer needs.

### From conversation to action

- Launches structured task workflows

### Customer success workflows

When conversations identify opportunities, Tallyfy:
- Triggers onboarding check-in processes
- Coordinates feature adoption campaigns
- Routes expansion opportunities to sales
- Tracks customer health actions

### Product feedback loops

When conversations surface feature requests, Tallyfy orchestrates:
- Structured feature request intake
- Product team evaluation workflows
- Customer communication on decisions
- Beta program coordination
