  that follows customer conversations - coordinating cross-department processes, tracking
  feature requests with accountability, and managing customer success handoffs that
  Intercom's chat and messaging tools don't cover.

## What Intercom can't do

Intercom is great at conversational support - live chat, bots, and messaging that feel natural. But conversations are unstructured by nature. They capture what customers say, not the work needed to act on it.

When a chat reveals a bug, requires a product change, or needs engineering input, the thread captures the discussion. It doesn't coordinate the multi-team work that actually resolves the customer's problem.

**What Intercom handles:**

- Live chat and messaging
- Bot-driven support automation
- Customer data and segments
- Conversation history

**What it doesn't cover:**

- Structured workflows triggered by conversation insights
- Multi-team coordination beyond chat
- Post-conversation follow-up with deadlines
- Feature request tracking with accountability
- Customer success handoffs with clear ownership

Intercom manages the conversation. Tallyfy manages the work that follows.

## How Tallyfy fills the gap

Tallyfy connects Intercom conversations to the structured workflows that deliver on customer needs.

### From conversation to action

When chats need follow-up, Tallyfy:
- Launches structured task workflows
- Assigns work to the right teams
- Tracks completion with deadlines
- Sends status updates back to support

### Customer success workflows

When conversations reveal opportunities, Tallyfy:
- Triggers onboarding check-in processes
- Coordinates feature adoption campaigns
- Routes expansion opportunities to sales

### Product feedback loops

When conversations surface feature requests, Tallyfy runs:
- Structured feature request intake
- Product team evaluation workflows
- Customer communication on decisions
- Beta program coordination
