## The gap HiBob cannot fill

HiBob (Bob) excels at modern HR - beautiful interfaces, employee self-service, and smart automation within HR. But people processes extend beyond HR data management to coordination across every department.

When someone joins in Bob, the HR system handles onboarding paperwork. But IT needs to provision accounts and equipment. Facilities needs to prepare workspace. Finance needs to set up expense access. These cross-department processes require coordination that Bob cannot orchestrate.

**What HiBob manages:**

- Modern HR interface and employee self-service
- Time-off management and approvals
- Performance cycles and reviews
- Employee records and organizational structure

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Cross-department process coordination
- IT provisioning and access management
- Equipment ordering and delivery tracking
- Multi-stakeholder approval chains
- External vendor and contractor workflows

HiBob serves your HR team beautifully. But employee processes span every department. Tallyfy orchestrates workflows across ALL your teams - not just one.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

When a HiBob employee event fires - hire, role change, time-off request, departure - Tallyfy launches a structured workflow that coordinates every downstream team.

### Employee onboarding

When Bob records a new hire, Tallyfy orchestrates:
- IT account setup and equipment provisioning
- Facilities workspace and building access
- Training schedule and compliance tracking
- Finance expense account configuration
- Team introduction and buddy assignment

### Time-off coordination

When Bob approves time-off, Tallyfy handles:
- Coverage arrangement workflows
- Knowledge transfer for extended leave
- Return-to-work preparation
- Task reassignment during absence
