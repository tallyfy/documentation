## Quick Summary

We're integrating with HiBob to transform their modern HR platform into the engine for all your people workflows. When employees join, request time off, or change roles in Bob, Tallyfy automatically orchestrates every related process - from equipment provisioning to manager approvals to compliance tracking - all while maintaining Bob as your central people platform.

<Aside type="tip" title="Developer-Friendly Platform">
HiBob provides comprehensive REST APIs with webhooks, OAuth 2.0 authentication, and SDKs in multiple languages. Their Developer Hub offers excellent documentation and sandbox environments for testing.

## Why This Integration Matters

HiBob excels at modern HR - beautiful interfaces, employee self-service, and smart automation. But people processes extend beyond HR data management. Every new hire needs IT setup, training schedules, and team integration. Every promotion triggers compensation reviews, access changes, and announcement workflows.

Our integration bridges this gap. Bob manages the people data. Tallyfy orchestrates the processes. Together, they create a seamless employee experience from hire to retire.

## What We're Building

### Smart Onboarding Flows

Transform new hire chaos into smooth experiences:

- **Pre-Boarding Magic**: As soon as someone's added to Bob, trigger equipment orders, account setup, and welcome communications
- **First Day Delight**: Pull role, team, and location data to orchestrate personalized onboarding experiences
- **Cultural Integration**: Automatically assign buddies, schedule coffee chats, and trigger team introductions
- **Progressive Onboarding**: 30/60/90-day check-ins based on start date with manager feedback loops

### Time-Off Orchestration

Go beyond approval to full coordination:

- **Coverage Workflows**: Time-off requests trigger coverage arrangement workflows
- **Handoff Processes**: Extended leave triggers knowledge transfer workflows
- **Return Planning**: PTO end dates trigger return-to-work preparation
- **Balance Management**: Low balance alerts trigger policy reminder workflows

### Employee Lifecycle Automation

Connect Bob events to comprehensive workflows:

- **Promotion Workflows**: Role changes trigger comp reviews, announcement, and access updates
- **Transfer Management**: Department moves trigger equipment, access, and introduction workflows
- **Performance Cycles**: Review periods trigger multi-step evaluation workflows
- **Offboarding Excellence**: Terminations trigger IT, knowledge transfer, and exit workflows

## How to Connect Today

### Option 1: HiBob REST API

Direct integration using Bob's modern APIs:

```javascript
// Example: Create onboarding workflow from Bob new hire
const handleBobNewHire = async (employeeData) => {
  // Get complete employee profile from Bob
  const employee = await bobAPI.get(`/people/${employeeData.id}`, {
    includeCustomFields: true,
    includeWorkHistory: true
  });
  
  // Get manager and team information
  const manager = await bobAPI.get(`/people/${employee.reportsTo.id}`);
  const team = await bobAPI.get(`/teams/${employee.team.id}`);
  
  // Create personalized onboarding workflow
  const workflow = await fetch('https://api.tallyfy.com/v1/workflows', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TALLYFY_KEY',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      template_id: 'bob_smart_onboarding',
      name: `Onboarding - ${employee.displayName}`,
      data: {
        // Bob employee data
        employee_id: employee.id,
        display_name: employee.displayName,
        email: employee.email,
        personal_email: employee.personalEmail,

        department: employee.work.department,
        team_name: team.name,
        team_members: team.members,

        manager_name: manager.displayName,
        manager_email: manager.email,
        skip_level: employee.work.reportsToIdSecondary,
        
        // Location and setup
        work_location: employee.work.location,
        site: employee.work.site,
        desk_location: employee.work.custom.desk_number,
        
        // Start details
        start_date: employee.work.startDate,
        contract_type: employee.work.employmentType,
        
        // Custom fields from Bob

        dietary_restrictions: employee.custom.dietary_needs,

      await createOnboardingWorkflow(event.employee);
      break;
      
    case 'timeoff.requested':
      await createCoverageWorkflow(event.timeoff);
      break;
      
    case 'employee.updated':
      if (event.changes.includes('work.title')) {
        await createPromotionWorkflow(event.employee);
      }
      break;
      
    case 'employee.terminated':
      await createOffboardingWorkflow(event.employee);
