## What HiBob can't coordinate on its own

HiBob (Bob) is great at modern HR - clean interfaces, employee self-service, and automation inside the HR department. But people processes don't stop at HR.

When someone joins in Bob, the HR system handles onboarding paperwork. IT still needs to provision accounts and equipment. Facilities needs to prepare a workspace. Finance needs to set up expense access. Bob can't coordinate all those teams at once.

**What HiBob handles well:**

- Employee self-service and HR records
- Time-off management and approvals
- Performance cycles and reviews

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Cross-department coordination after HR events
- IT provisioning and access management
- Equipment ordering and delivery tracking
- Multi-team approval chains
- External vendor and contractor workflows

Bob serves your HR team well. But employee processes span every department - and Tallyfy coordinates workflows across all your teams, not just one.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

When a HiBob event fires - hire, role change, time-off request, departure - Tallyfy launches a structured workflow that coordinates every downstream team.

### Employee onboarding

When Bob records a new hire, Tallyfy kicks off:
- IT account setup and equipment provisioning
- Facilities workspace and building access
- Training schedule and compliance tracking
- Finance expense account configuration
- Team introduction and buddy assignment

### Time-off coordination

When Bob approves time-off, Tallyfy handles:
- Coverage arrangement workflows
- Knowledge transfer for extended leave
- Return-to-work preparation
- Task reassignment during absence
