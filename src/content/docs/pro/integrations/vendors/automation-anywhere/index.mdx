## The gap Automation Anywhere cannot fill

Automation Anywhere's cloud-native platform excels at automating repetitive digital tasks. But business processes don't end when a bot finishes - they continue with human activities that Automation Anywhere cannot coordinate.

When an Automation Anywhere bot processes a purchase order, the PO still needs human approval. When it extracts data from emails, someone needs to verify exceptions. When it updates a CRM, a sales rep needs to follow up. These human steps happen outside the bot's visibility.

**What Automation Anywhere automates:**

- Document processing with IQ Bot
- Data extraction and transformation
- Cross-application workflows
- Cloud and desktop automation

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Process visibility across automated and manual steps
- Accountability for end-to-end process outcomes
- Human judgment steps embedded in automated flows
- SLA tracking that spans bots and people
- Exception escalation to the right human reviewers
- Coordination when multiple bots and humans share a process

Automation Anywhere automates tasks. Tallyfy orchestrates processes - providing the visibility and accountability layer that connects bot work with human work.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

Tallyfy serves as the orchestration layer that connects Automation Anywhere with human workflows, creating complete process automation.

### End-to-end visibility

When Automation Anywhere bots execute, Tallyfy provides:
- Real-time status across all steps - automated and manual
- Single dashboard showing bot completion and human task progress
- Process-level metrics combining bot and human performance
- Audit trail spanning the entire process lifecycle

### Accountability framework

Tallyfy ensures nothing falls through the cracks:
- Every human step has an owner and deadline
- Exceptions automatically route to appropriate reviewers
- Escalation rules prevent stalled processes
- Completion tracking across all participants

### Intelligent routing

When bots encounter edge cases, Tallyfy handles:
- Classification of exception types
- Routing to specialized human reviewers
- Priority assignment based on business impact
- Return-to-automation once resolved
