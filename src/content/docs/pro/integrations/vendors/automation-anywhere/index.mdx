## Where Automation Anywhere stops short

Automation Anywhere is great at automating repetitive digital tasks. But business processes don't end when a bot finishes - they continue with human activities that Automation Anywhere can't coordinate.

When a bot processes a purchase order, it still needs human approval. When it extracts data from emails, someone has to verify exceptions. When it updates a CRM, a sales rep needs to follow up. These human steps happen outside the bot's visibility.

**What Automation Anywhere automates:**

- Document processing with IQ Bot
- Data extraction and transformation
- Cross-application workflows
- Cloud and desktop automation

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Visibility across automated and manual steps
- Accountability for end-to-end process outcomes
- Human judgment steps inside automated flows
- SLA tracking that spans bots and people
- Exception escalation to the right reviewers

Automation Anywhere automates tasks. Tallyfy manages the full process - connecting bot work with human work through visibility and accountability.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

Tallyfy acts as the coordination layer between Automation Anywhere bots and human workflows.

### Full process visibility

When Automation Anywhere bots run, Tallyfy provides:
- Real-time status across all steps - automated and manual
- A single dashboard showing bot completion and human task progress
- Process-level metrics combining bot and human performance
- An audit trail spanning the entire process

### Accountability for every step

Tallyfy makes sure nothing gets missed:
- Every human step has an owner and deadline
- Exceptions automatically route to the right reviewers
- Escalation rules prevent stalled processes
- Completion tracking across all participants

### Intelligent routing

When bots hit edge cases, Tallyfy handles:
- Classifying exception types
- Routing to the right human reviewers
- Assigning priority based on business impact
- Returning to automation once resolved
