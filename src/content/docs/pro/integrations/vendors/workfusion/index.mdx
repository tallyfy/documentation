## The gap WorkFusion can't fill

WorkFusion combines AI and RPA to automate judgment-intensive processes. Its machine learning models improve over time, handling increasingly sophisticated decisions. But even the best AI can't handle every scenario - human expertise is essential for edge cases, model training, and final approvals.

When WorkFusion's AI processes a complex claim, borderline cases still need human judgment. New document types need human guidance. High-stakes outcomes need human oversight. WorkFusion augments human work - but it can't manage the human activities that surround its automation.

**What WorkFusion automates:**

- AI-powered document processing
- Intelligent automation with machine learning
- Complex decision automation
- Continuous learning from human feedback

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Human-in-the-loop coordination for model training
- Exception escalation to experts
- Approval workflows for high-stakes AI decisions
- Visibility across AI automation and human work
- Accountability for end-to-end outcomes
- Coordination when AI confidence is low

WorkFusion augments human decision-making with AI. Tallyfy handles the complete process - coordinating AI automation with human oversight, exception handling, and approval workflows.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

Tallyfy acts as the coordination layer connecting WorkFusion AI automation with human workflows.

### Human-in-the-loop coordination

When WorkFusion processes work, Tallyfy manages:
- Routing low-confidence items to human reviewers
- Collecting human decisions to improve AI models
- Escalating edge cases to the right experts
- Tracking human-AI collaboration metrics

### AI-human handoffs

Tallyfy keeps transitions smooth:
- AI processes routine items automatically
- Borderline cases route to a human review queue
- Human decisions feed back to improve AI
- High-stakes items always include human approval

### Exception management

When AI encounters uncertainty:
- WorkFusion flags the item with a confidence score
- Tallyfy routes it based on confidence thresholds
- A specialist reviews and decides
- The decision gets recorded for model improvement
