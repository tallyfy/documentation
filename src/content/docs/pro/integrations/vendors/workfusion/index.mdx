## The gap WorkFusion cannot fill

WorkFusion combines AI and RPA to automate complex, judgment-intensive processes. Its machine learning models improve over time, handling increasingly sophisticated decisions. But even the best AI cannot handle every scenario - human expertise is essential for edge cases, model training, and final approvals.

When WorkFusion's AI processes a complex claim, borderline cases still need human judgment. When it classifies documents, new document types need human guidance. When it makes a decision, high-stakes outcomes need human oversight. WorkFusion augments human work - but cannot orchestrate the human activities that surround its automation.

**What WorkFusion automates:**

- AI-powered document processing
- Intelligent automation with machine learning
- Complex decision automation
- Continuous learning from human feedback

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Human-in-the-loop orchestration for model training
- Exception escalation to subject matter experts
- Approval workflows for high-stakes AI decisions
- Process visibility spanning AI automation and human work
- Accountability for end-to-end outcomes
- Coordination when AI confidence is low

WorkFusion augments human decision-making with AI. Tallyfy orchestrates the complete process - coordinating AI automation with human oversight, exception handling, and approval workflows.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

Tallyfy serves as the orchestration layer that connects WorkFusion AI automation with human workflows.

### Human-in-the-loop coordination

When WorkFusion processes work, Tallyfy manages:
- Routing low-confidence items to human reviewers
- Collecting human decisions to improve AI models
- Escalating edge cases to subject matter experts
- Tracking human-AI collaboration metrics

### AI-human handoffs

Tallyfy ensures smooth transitions:
- AI processes routine items automatically
- Borderline cases route to human review queue
- Human decisions feed back to improve AI
- High-stakes items always include human approval

### Exception management

When AI encounters uncertainty:
- WorkFusion flags item with confidence score
- Tallyfy routes based on confidence thresholds
- Specialist reviews and decides
- Decision recorded for model improvement
