## The gap Close cannot fill

Close excels at inside sales - built-in calling, email sequences, and pipeline management for high-velocity sales teams. But between each call and each stage change, tasks must happen that Close cannot coordinate.

When a sales rep logs a qualifying call in Close, the next steps often involve other people: scheduling a demo with a solutions engineer, getting pricing approved, having legal review custom terms. Close tracks the deal and the communications - but not the multi-person tasks that move deals forward.

**What Close manages:**

- Built-in calling and SMS
- Email sequences and tracking
- Pipeline and deal management
- Sales team activity

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Micro-tasks between calls and meetings
- Cross-team coordination for demos and proposals
- Approval workflows for pricing exceptions
- Post-call follow-up task assignment
- Handoffs to Operations after close
- Audit trails for deal execution

Close helps reps work fast. Tallyfy ensures the supporting work across your organization happens just as fast.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

Tallyfy serves as the orchestration layer that connects Close activities with the detailed workflows that support each deal.

### Call follow-up workflows

After calls logged in Close, Tallyfy:
- Launches follow-up task sequences
- Assigns prep work to relevant team members
- Tracks completion before next touchpoint
- Escalates if tasks are overdue

### Demo and proposal coordination

When deals need demos or proposals, Tallyfy:
- Coordinates scheduling with solutions engineers
- Routes technical requirements gathering
- Manages proposal development across teams
- Tracks approvals and revisions

### Post-sale workflows

When deals close in Close, Tallyfy orchestrates:
- Immediate handoff to Customer Success
- Account setup and provisioning
- Onboarding kickoff tasks
- Training scheduling
