  sales calls - like demo scheduling with solutions engineers, pricing approvals, and
  post-sale handoffs - that Close's calling and pipeline tools can't coordinate alone.

## What Close can't do on its own

Close is great for inside sales - calling, email sequences, and pipeline tracking for fast-moving teams. But between calls and stage changes, tasks pile up that Close can't coordinate.

A rep logs a qualifying call. Now what? Someone needs to schedule a demo with a solutions engineer. Pricing needs approval. Legal has to review custom terms. Close tracks the deal and comms - not the multi-person work that actually moves deals forward.

**What Close handles:**

- Built-in calling and SMS
- Email sequences and tracking
- Pipeline and deal management

**What falls through:**

- Tasks between calls and meetings
- Cross-team coordination for demos and proposals
- Pricing exception approvals
- Post-call follow-up assignments
- Handoffs to Operations after close

Close helps reps work fast. Tallyfy makes sure the supporting work across your org keeps pace.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

Tallyfy connects Close activities with the workflows that support each deal - so nothing gets dropped between stages.

### Call follow-up workflows

After calls logged in Close, Tallyfy:
- Launches follow-up task sequences
- Assigns prep work to the right team members
- Tracks completion before the next touchpoint
- Escalates overdue tasks automatically

### Demo and proposal coordination

When deals need demos or proposals, Tallyfy:
- Coordinates scheduling with solutions engineers
- Routes technical requirements gathering
- Manages proposal development across teams
- Tracks approvals and revisions

### Post-sale workflows

When deals close, Tallyfy kicks off:
- Handoff to Customer Success
- Account setup and provisioning
- Onboarding tasks
- Training scheduling
