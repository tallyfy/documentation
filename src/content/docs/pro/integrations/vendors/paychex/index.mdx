## The gap Paychex cannot fill

Paychex Flex handles payroll processing, HR, and benefits administration. But the moment payroll runs or an employee status changes, coordination across departments requires manual intervention.

Paychex cannot orchestrate IT account setup when someone is hired. It cannot coordinate Facilities for workspace preparation. It cannot route approval workflows for overtime exceptions or compensation changes. These cross-system handoffs happen through email and manual tracking.

**What Paychex manages:**

- Payroll processing and tax filing
- HR administration and employee records
- Benefits administration
- Time and attendance tracking

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Cross-department coordination for IT, Facilities, and Training
- Multi-step approval workflows for payroll exceptions
- Reconciliation workflows between payroll and accounting
- Real-time visibility into onboarding completion
- Structured handoffs with clear ownership and deadlines

Paychex serves your HR and payroll needs. But employee processes span every department. Tallyfy orchestrates workflows across ALL your teams - not just one.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

When a Paychex employee event fires - hire, termination, payroll completion - Tallyfy launches a structured workflow that coordinates every downstream action across your organization.

### Payroll coordination

When Paychex processes payroll, Tallyfy handles:
- Pre-payroll timesheet approval workflows
- Exception routing for overtime and adjustments
- Accounting reconciliation tasks
- Cost center allocation verification

### Employee onboarding

When Paychex records a new hire, Tallyfy orchestrates:
- IT account setup and equipment provisioning
- Facilities workspace preparation
- Training schedule and compliance tracking
- Finance expense account configuration
