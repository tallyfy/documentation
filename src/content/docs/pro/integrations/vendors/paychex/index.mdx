## Quick Summary

We're building native integration with Paychex Flex to automatically sync payroll and HR data into intelligent workflows. When payroll runs, employees change status, or benefits update in Paychex, Tallyfy workflows instantly orchestrate the right follow-up actions across your entire organization - from accounting reconciliation to compliance documentation.

<Aside type="tip" title="Paychex Marketplace Available">
Paychex has an active marketplace and developer program with extensive APIs. While we pursue official partnership, you can connect immediately using their open API platform or integration partners like Flexspring.

## Why This Integration Matters

Paychex processes payroll for over 740,000 businesses, but payroll is just the beginning of countless downstream processes. Every pay run triggers accounting entries, tax filings, and reporting workflows. Every employee change cascades through benefits, compliance, and operational systems.

Without integration, your team manually bridges these gaps - exporting reports, re-entering data, and hoping nothing falls through the cracks. Our integration makes Paychex data flow seamlessly into structured workflows that run themselves.

## What We're Building

### Payroll Orchestration Workflows

Transform payroll from a deadline scramble to a smooth operation:

- **Pre-Payroll Processing**: Launch approval workflows for timesheet review, PTO requests, and commission calculations
- **Payroll Run Automation**: Trigger accounting workflows when payroll completes, including journal entries and cash flow updates
- **Post-Payroll Reconciliation**: Automate benefits deductions verification, tax liability tracking, and reporting distribution
- **Exception Handling**: Flag and route payroll anomalies like overtime spikes or missing timecards for review

### Employee Lifecycle Automation

Connect Paychex employee events to comprehensive workflows:

- **Onboarding Excellence**: Pull new hire data including compensation, tax elections, and benefits to launch complete onboarding
- **Status Change Management**: Detect full-time/part-time changes, LOAs, or terminations to trigger appropriate workflows
- **Anniversary Tracking**: Automate review cycles, benefit eligibility changes, and milestone recognition
- **Multi-State Compliance**: Handle state registrations and tax updates when employees relocate

### Benefits and Compliance

Leverage Paychex benefits data for critical workflows:

- **Open Enrollment Orchestration**: Coordinate communications, track elections, and ensure deadline compliance
- **Life Event Processing**: Automate qualifying event workflows for benefits changes
- **401(k) Administration**: Sync contribution changes and loan requests with plan administrators
- **ACA Compliance**: Track hours, manage affordability, and generate required reporting

## How to Connect Today

### Option 1: Direct API Integration

Use Paychex's comprehensive API platform:

```javascript
// Example: Trigger workflow when payroll completes
const handlePayrollComplete = async (payrollData) => {
  // Get payroll details from Paychex
  const payrollDetails = await paychexAPI.getPayrollRun(payrollData.id);
  
  // Create accounting reconciliation workflow
  const workflow = await fetch('https://api.tallyfy.com/v1/workflows', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TALLYFY_KEY',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      template_id: 'payroll_reconciliation',
      name: `Payroll ${payrollDetails.pay_date}`,
      data: {
        pay_date: payrollDetails.pay_date,
        total_gross: payrollDetails.total_gross,
        total_net: payrollDetails.total_net,
        total_taxes: payrollDetails.total_taxes,
        employee_count: payrollDetails.employee_count,
        department_breakdown: payrollDetails.by_department
      }
    })
  });
  
  return workflow.json();
};
```
