## Quick Summary

We're integrating with QuickBooks Payroll to automatically transform payroll data into intelligent workflows that handle everything from expense approvals to tax compliance. When you run payroll, add employees, or process timesheets in QuickBooks, Tallyfy orchestrates all the downstream processes - ensuring accurate financials, proper approvals, and complete compliance.

<Aside type="caution" title="API Migration Required">
QuickBooks requires migration to their new Payroll API by October 31, 2024. The new API offers improved capabilities but requires Intuit partnership approval for production access.
</Aside>

## Why This Integration Matters

QuickBooks Payroll processes millions of paychecks, but payroll is just the start of numerous financial workflows. Every pay run needs accounting entries, tax filings, and benefit reconciliations. Every new employee triggers onboarding tasks across departments.

Without integration, your team manually bridges QuickBooks with other systems - exporting reports, copying data, and chasing approvals. Our integration makes QuickBooks data automatically flow into structured workflows that ensure accuracy and compliance.

## What We're Building

### Payroll Processing Automation

Transform payroll from scramble to smooth operation:

- **Pre-Payroll Review**: Launch timesheet approval workflows before processing
- **Exception Management**: Route overtime, bonuses, and adjustments for approval
- **Post-Payroll Reconciliation**: Automate journal entries and department allocations
- **Tax Compliance**: Trigger filing reminders and payment workflows

### Employee Lifecycle Management

Connect QuickBooks employee events to workflows:

- **New Hire Onboarding**: Pull employee data to launch comprehensive onboarding
- **Contractor Management**: 1099 setup, approval, and compliance workflows
- **Termination Processing**: Final pay calculations and exit workflows
- **Year-End Processes**: W-2/1099 distribution and corrections

### Financial Integration Workflows

Leverage QuickBooks data for financial processes:

- **Expense Management**: Route employee expenses through approval chains
- **Cash Flow Planning**: Trigger alerts when payroll impacts cash position
- **Budget Tracking**: Monitor labor costs against departmental budgets
- **Audit Preparation**: Maintain documentation for payroll audits

## How to Connect Today

### Option 1: QuickBooks Payroll API

Direct integration with OAuth 2.0:

```javascript
// Example: Trigger workflow after payroll run
const handlePayrollComplete = async (payrollData) => {
  // Get payroll details from QuickBooks
  const paycheck = await quickbooksAPI.getPaycheck(payrollData.paycheckId);
  
  // Create accounting reconciliation workflow
  const workflow = await fetch('https://api.tallyfy.com/v1/workflows', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TALLYFY_KEY',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      template_id: 'payroll_reconciliation',
      name: `Payroll - ${paycheck.payDate}`,
      data: {
        pay_date: paycheck.payDate,
        employee: paycheck.employee.displayName,
        
        // Earnings breakdown
        regular_hours: paycheck.earnings.regular.hours,
        regular_amount: paycheck.earnings.regular.amount,
        overtime_hours: paycheck.earnings.overtime?.hours || 0,
        overtime_amount: paycheck.earnings.overtime?.amount || 0,
        
        // Deductions
        federal_tax: paycheck.deductions.federalTax,
        state_tax: paycheck.deductions.stateTax,
        benefits: paycheck.deductions.benefits,
        
        // Employer costs
        employer_taxes: paycheck.employerTaxes,
        employer_benefits: paycheck.employerBenefits,
        
        // Accounting
        department: paycheck.class,
        location: paycheck.location,
        journal_entry_required: true
      }
    })
  });
  
  return workflow.json();
};
```

### Option 2: QuickBooks Webhooks

Set up real-time event notifications:

```javascript
// Configure webhook endpoint
app.post('/webhooks/quickbooks', async (req, res) => {
  const notification = req.body;
  
  for (const event of notification.eventNotifications) {
    if (event.dataChangeEvent.entities[0].name === 'Employee') {
      // New employee added
      await createOnboardingWorkflow(event.dataChangeEvent.entities[0].id);
    } else if (event.dataChangeEvent.entities[0].name === 'Paycheck') {
      // Payroll processed
      await createReconciliationWorkflow(event.dataChangeEvent.entities[0].id);
    }
  }
  
  res.status(200).send('OK');
});
```

### Option 3: Integration Platforms

Use unified accounting APIs:

- **Merge**: Unified Accounting API with QuickBooks support
- **Finch**: Employment API including QuickBooks Payroll
- **Knit**: QuickBooks-specific integration tools
- **Apideck**: Unified APIs for accounting and HRIS

### Option 4: Report-Based Integration

For immediate needs without API approval:

1. Schedule QuickBooks reports (Payroll Summary, Employee List)
2. Export to CSV or Excel format
3. Upload to Tallyfy for processing
4. Trigger workflows based on data changes
5. Maintain audit trail of all imports
