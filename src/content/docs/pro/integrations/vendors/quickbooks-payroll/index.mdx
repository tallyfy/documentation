## The gap QuickBooks Payroll can't fill

QuickBooks Payroll handles payroll processing and integrates with QuickBooks accounting. But every payroll event triggers downstream coordination that QuickBooks can't manage.

Timesheets need verifying before processing. Exceptions need routing through approval chains. Accounting needs reconciliation tasks. New hires need IT provisioning, equipment, and training. These cross-department handoffs all happen outside QuickBooks.

**What QuickBooks Payroll manages:**

- Payroll processing and tax filing
- Direct deposit and payment distribution
- Basic employee records
- Integration with QuickBooks accounting

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Multi-step approval workflows for exceptions
- Cross-department coordination for onboarding
- IT provisioning and equipment setup
- Reconciliation workflows with accounting review
- Month-end close coordination

QuickBooks Payroll processes your pay runs - but business processes span every department. Tallyfy coordinates workflows across ALL your teams, not just one.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

When a QuickBooks Payroll event fires - pay run, new hire, exception - Tallyfy launches a structured workflow that coordinates every downstream team.

### Payroll coordination

When QuickBooks processes payroll, Tallyfy handles:
- Pre-payroll timesheet approval workflows
- Exception routing for overtime and bonuses
- Accounting reconciliation and review tasks
- Cost center allocation verification

### Employee onboarding

When QuickBooks records a new hire, Tallyfy coordinates:
- IT account setup and equipment provisioning
- Training schedule and compliance tracking
- Finance expense account configuration
- Manager introduction workflows
