## The gap Rippling cannot fill

Rippling unifies HR, IT, and Finance on one platform with strong internal automation. But enterprise approval hierarchies and regulatory compliance workflows require coordination that extends beyond Rippling's ecosystem.

Rippling's if-then automation handles simple triggers well. But complex multi-conditional workflows - where approval routing depends on salary thresholds AND manager level AND department AND budget availability - require significant configuration. And workflows involving external vendors, contractors, or compliance partners need orchestration beyond Rippling's boundaries.

**What Rippling manages:**

- Unified employee database across HR, IT, and Finance
- Device provisioning and app access management
- Payroll and benefits administration
- Internal if-then automation rules

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Enterprise approval hierarchies with complex conditions
- Compliance audit trails for regulatory requirements (SOC 2, GDPR)
- Coordination with external vendors, contractors, and partners
- Multi-stakeholder workflows spanning outside Rippling's ecosystem
- Change management rollouts across departments

Rippling unifies your internal HR, IT, and Finance data. But business processes extend beyond Rippling to external partners and complex approval chains. Tallyfy orchestrates workflows across ALL your stakeholders - internal and external.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

When a Rippling employee event fires - hire, role change, termination - Tallyfy launches a structured workflow that coordinates stakeholders both inside and outside Rippling's platform.

### Enterprise approvals

When Rippling records changes requiring complex approval, Tallyfy handles:
- Multi-conditional routing (salary + level + department + budget)
- Sequential approval chains with deadline enforcement
- Escalation when approvers don't respond
- Audit trails for compliance documentation

### Compliance workflows

When regulatory processes are triggered, Tallyfy orchestrates:
- Policy rollout coordination across all departments
- External vendor and contractor compliance verification
- Documentation collection and approval chains
- Audit preparation with complete trails

### External coordination

When processes extend beyond Rippling, Tallyfy manages:
- Vendor onboarding with compliance checks
- Contractor workflows with legal review
- Partner coordination for implementations
