## Why This Integration Matters

Rippling revolutionized workforce management by unifying HR, IT, and Finance. But even with Rippling's automation, countless processes still require human coordination - equipment approvals, training schedules, project assignments, and compliance tasks.

Our integration bridges this gap. Rippling handles the systems. Tallyfy handles the processes. Together, they create truly automated operations where nothing requires manual follow-up.

## What We're Building

### Unified Onboarding Workflows

Go beyond basic provisioning to complete readiness:

- **Pre-Arrival Preparation**: As soon as someone signs their offer in Rippling, trigger workspace setup, equipment ordering, and team notifications
- **Device Configuration**: Rippling provisions the laptop, Tallyfy ensures it's configured with project-specific tools and access
- **Team Integration**: Automatically schedule meet-and-greets, assign mentors, and create first-week agendas
- **Progressive Onboarding**: 30/60/90-day check-ins triggered by hire date with manager reviews

### IT Operations Orchestration

Extend Rippling's IT management with process workflows:

- **Access Requests**: Route non-standard access requests through approval chains
- **Equipment Lifecycle**: Track laptop refresh cycles, warranty expirations, and replacement workflows
- **Security Incidents**: When Rippling detects issues, Tallyfy orchestrates the response
- **Software Approvals**: Manage requests for tools outside standard stack

### Finance Process Automation

Connect Rippling's finance features to workflows:

- **Expense Approvals**: Route expense reports through complex approval matrices
- **Corporate Card Management**: Orchestrate card requests, limit changes, and violation reviews
- **Budget Workflows**: Trigger processes when headcount or spending approaches limits
- **Vendor Management**: Coordinate new vendor setup and compliance

## How to Connect Today

### Option 1: Rippling REST API

Direct integration using Rippling's modern APIs:

```javascript
// Example: Create comprehensive onboarding from Rippling hire
const createOnboardingWorkflow = async (ripplingEmployee) => {
  // Use field expansion to get all needed data in one call
  const employee = await ripplingAPI.get(`/employees/${ripplingEmployee.id}`, {
    expand: ['department', 'manager', 'compensation', 'equipment']
  });
  
  // Determine workflow template based on role
  const template = determineTemplate(employee.jobTitle, employee.department);
  
  // Create workflow with full context
  const workflow = await fetch('https://api.tallyfy.com/v1/workflows', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TALLYFY_KEY',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      template_id: template,
      name: `Onboarding - ${employee.fullName}`,
      data: {
        // Employee details from Rippling
        employee_id: employee.id,
        name: employee.fullName,
        email: employee.workEmail,
        personal_email: employee.personalEmail,
        
        // Role and organization
        title: employee.jobTitle,
        department: employee.department.name,
        team: employee.team,
        manager: employee.manager.name,
        
        // Logistics
        start_date: employee.startDate,
        work_location: employee.workLocation,
        remote_type: employee.employmentType,
        
        // Equipment from Rippling
        laptop_model: employee.equipment.laptop?.model,
        needs_monitor: employee.workLocation === 'OFFICE',
        
        // Compensation tier (for equipment/perk decisions)
