## The gap Power Automate Desktop can't fill

Power Automate Desktop (PAD) brings RPA to every Windows user - automating clicks, keystrokes, and legacy app interactions. But desktop automation is just one piece of your business processes. The human activities that happen before, after, and alongside PAD flows need coordination too.

Who verifies data after PAD enters it into a legacy system? Who reviews extracted output? Who resolves errors? PAD automates desktop tasks - it can't coordinate the broader processes those tasks belong to.

**What PAD automates:**

- Legacy desktop application interaction
- UI-based data entry and extraction
- Local file and folder operations
- Windows automation tasks

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Coordinating desktop automation with human work
- Exception handling beyond the desktop flow
- Visibility into where desktop automation fits in broader processes
- Human approvals and reviews of automated outputs
- SLA tracking across human and automated steps
- Accountability for end-to-end process completion

PAD automates what happens on desktops. Tallyfy coordinates the full process - connecting desktop automation with human activities, cloud services, and cross-department workflows.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

Tallyfy acts as the coordination layer connecting Power Automate Desktop with human workflows and cloud-based processes.

### Process coordination

When PAD flows run, Tallyfy:
- Triggers desktop automation at the right point in the process
- Assigns human tasks before and after desktop automation
- Tracks completion across all steps - cloud, desktop, and human
- Routes exceptions to the right reviewers

### Human - automation handoffs

Tallyfy manages smooth transitions:
- Human completes preparation task → Tallyfy triggers PAD flow
- PAD flow completes → Tallyfy assigns verification task
- Human approves → process moves to next stage
- Full audit trail maintained throughout

### Exception management

When PAD hits errors:
- Tallyfy gets notified via Power Automate cloud flow
- Routes to a human troubleshooter with context
- Tracks resolution and outcome
- Restarts automation when it's ready
