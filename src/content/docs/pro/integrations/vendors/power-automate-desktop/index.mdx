## The gap Power Automate Desktop cannot fill

Power Automate Desktop (PAD) brings RPA to every Windows user - automating clicks, keystrokes, and legacy application interactions. But desktop automation is just one piece of your business processes. The human activities that happen before, after, and alongside PAD flows need coordination too.

When PAD enters data into a legacy system, who verifies it was entered correctly? When it extracts information from desktop applications, who reviews the output? When it hits an error, who resolves it? PAD automates desktop tasks - it cannot orchestrate the broader processes those tasks belong to.

**What Power Automate Desktop automates:**

- Legacy desktop application interaction
- UI-based data entry and extraction
- Local file and folder operations
- Windows automation tasks

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Process orchestration spanning desktop automation and human work
- Exception handling beyond the desktop flow
- Visibility into where desktop automation fits in broader processes
- Human approvals and reviews of automated outputs
- SLA tracking across human and automated steps
- Accountability for end-to-end process completion

Power Automate Desktop automates what happens on desktops. Tallyfy orchestrates processes - coordinating desktop automation with human activities, cloud services, and cross-department workflows.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

Tallyfy serves as the orchestration layer that connects Power Automate Desktop with human workflows and cloud-based processes.

### Process orchestration

When PAD flows execute, Tallyfy:
- Triggers desktop automation at the right point in the process
- Assigns human tasks before and after desktop automation
- Tracks completion across all steps - cloud, desktop, and human
- Routes exceptions to appropriate reviewers

### Human-automation coordination

Tallyfy manages seamless transitions:
- Human completes preparation task → Tallyfy triggers PAD flow
- PAD flow completes → Tallyfy assigns verification task
- Human approves → process continues to next stage
- Complete audit trail maintained

### Exception management

When PAD encounters errors:
- Tallyfy receives notification via Power Automate cloud flow
- Routes to human troubleshooter with context
- Tracks resolution and outcome
- Restarts automation when ready

Connect Power Automate Desktop with Tallyfy using Power Automate cloud flows as the bridge.
</Aside>

**Power Automate (cloud)**: Use [Power Automate](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/) cloud flows to trigger PAD flows and connect to Tallyfy.

**Hybrid pattern**: Cloud flow receives Tallyfy webhook → triggers PAD on local machine → sends completion back to Tallyfy.

**API**: Use [Tallyfy's API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) with Power Automate HTTP actions.
