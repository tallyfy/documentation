## The gap Jira Service Management can't fill

Jira Service Management connects IT support with development through Jira. When tickets need engineering work, the handoff is smooth. But many service requests need action from teams who don't use Jira - HR, Finance, Legal, Operations.

When a JSM ticket triggers procurement, requires facilities work, or needs marketing involvement, you're back to email and manual tracking. JSM handles the IT-to-Dev flow. It doesn't cover the broader business workflows that service requests often kick off.

**What Jira Service Management handles:**

- IT service request handling
- Incident and problem management
- Connection to Jira development workflows
- Self-service portal and knowledge base

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Business process coordination outside Jira
- Non-technical team task management
- Cross-department handoffs with accountability
- Approval workflows beyond IT
- Vendor and external coordination

JSM bridges IT and Development. Tallyfy bridges IT with the rest of your business.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

Tallyfy acts as the coordination layer that extends Jira Service Management into business processes - without requiring everyone to use Jira.

### Business team coordination

When service requests need non-IT action, Tallyfy:
- Triggers business workflows from JSM tickets
- Assigns tasks to people outside Jira
- Tracks completion with deadlines
- Syncs status back to the service desk

### Approval workflows

When requests need business sign-off, Tallyfy:
- Routes to the right business approvers
- Handles multi-level approval chains
- Documents approval history
- Enforces compliance requirements

### Operational handoffs

When IT service delivery triggers business action, Tallyfy coordinates:
- New employee equipment and access setup
- Vendor onboarding coordination
- Security compliance workflows
- Business continuity procedures
