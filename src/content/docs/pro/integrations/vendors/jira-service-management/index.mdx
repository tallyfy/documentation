## The gap Jira Service Management cannot fill

Jira Service Management connects IT support with development through Jira. When tickets need engineering attention, the handoff is seamless. But many service requests require action from teams who don't use Jira - HR, Finance, Legal, Operations.

When a JSM ticket triggers procurement, requires facilities work, or needs marketing involvement, you're back to email and manual tracking. JSM manages the IT-to-Dev flow. It doesn't orchestrate the broader business workflows that service requests often require.

**What Jira Service Management manages:**

- IT service request handling
- Incident and problem management
- Connection to Jira development workflows
- Self-service portal and knowledge base

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Business process coordination outside Jira
- Non-technical team task management
- Cross-department handoffs with accountability
- Approval workflows beyond IT
- Vendor and external coordination
- Operational follow-up processes

JSM bridges IT and Development. Tallyfy bridges IT with the rest of your business.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

Tallyfy serves as the orchestration layer that extends Jira Service Management into business processes without requiring everyone to use Jira.

### Business team coordination

When service requests need non-IT action, Tallyfy:
- Triggers business workflows from JSM tickets
- Assigns tasks to people outside Jira
- Tracks completion with deadlines
- Syncs status back to the service desk

### Approval workflows

When requests need business approval, Tallyfy:
- Routes to appropriate business approvers
- Handles multi-level approval chains
- Documents approval history
- Enforces compliance requirements

### Operational handoffs

When IT service delivery triggers business action, Tallyfy orchestrates:
- New employee equipment and access setup
- Vendor onboarding coordination
- Security compliance workflows
- Business continuity procedures
