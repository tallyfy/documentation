## Quick Summary

We're building deep integration with Justworks to automatically sync employee data, trigger workflows based on HR events, and eliminate manual data entry between your PEO platform and business processes. When someone's hired, terminated, or changes roles in Justworks, Tallyfy workflows instantly kick off the right processes - from IT provisioning to compliance training.

<Aside type="note" title="Current Status">
Justworks launched their Partner API in 2024 with Electric as their first native integration. While we work on becoming an official partner, you can connect today using our middleware platform or API integration tools.
</Aside>

## Why This Integration Matters

Justworks customers manage critical HR operations through their PEO platform, but the real work happens across dozens of other systems. Every new hire triggers IT setup, training assignments, equipment ordering, and compliance tasks. Without integration, HR teams manually copy data and chase down tasks across departments.

Our integration eliminates this chaos by automatically flowing Justworks data into structured workflows that ensure nothing falls through the cracks.

## What We're Building

### Automated Employee Lifecycle Management

When employee events happen in Justworks, workflows automatically trigger:

- **New Hire Onboarding**: Pull employee details, department, manager, and start date to launch comprehensive onboarding workflows
- **Role Changes**: Detect promotions or transfers to trigger access updates, training requirements, and notification workflows  
- **Offboarding**: When someone's terminated in Justworks, instantly start IT deprovisioning, exit interviews, and final pay processes

### Payroll Process Automation

Connect payroll runs to downstream processes:

- **Pre-Payroll Checklists**: Launch approval workflows before each pay period
- **Time-Off Synchronization**: Sync PTO requests and approvals between systems
- **Expense Reimbursements**: Trigger review workflows for expense submissions
- **Benefits Enrollment**: Automate open enrollment communications and tracking

### Compliance and Documentation

Leverage Justworks data for compliance workflows:

- **I-9 Verification**: Track and remind about employment verification deadlines
- **State Registration**: Trigger workflows when employees work in new states
- **Policy Acknowledgments**: Ensure employees complete required training and sign policies
- **Audit Trails**: Maintain complete records of all HR-triggered processes

## How to Connect Today

### Option 1: API Integration (Recommended)

Use our REST API to push Justworks events into Tallyfy:

```javascript
// Example: Create workflow when new employee added in Justworks
const createOnboardingWorkflow = async (employee) => {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.tallyfy.com/v1/workflows', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      template_id: 'employee_onboarding',
      name: `Onboarding - ${employee.name}`,
      data: {
        employee_id: employee.id,
        employee_name: employee.name,
        department: employee.department,
        manager: employee.manager_name,
        start_date: employee.start_date,
        location: employee.location,
        role: employee.position
      }
    })
  });
  
  return response.json();
};
```

### Option 2: Webhook Automation

Since Justworks Partner API supports webhooks, set up automated triggers:

1. Configure webhooks in Justworks Partner API (when available)
2. Point webhooks to Tallyfy's webhook endpoint
3. Map Justworks events to workflow triggers
4. Test with employee changes to verify automation

### Option 3: iPaaS Platforms

Use integration platforms that support Justworks:

- **Merge API**: Connect through their unified HRIS API
- **Finch**: Use their employment API for Justworks data
- **Workato**: Build recipes connecting Justworks to Tallyfy
- **Make.com**: Create scenarios for HR automation

### Option 4: CSV Import Bridge

For immediate needs without API access:

1. Export employee data from Justworks Reports
2. Use Tallyfy's bulk import to create workflows
3. Schedule regular exports for updates
4. Maintain mapping spreadsheet for consistency

## Real-World Use Cases

### Tech Startup Onboarding

A 200-person SaaS company uses Justworks for PEO services. When HR adds a new engineer:

1. Justworks data flows to Tallyfy via API
2. IT provisions laptop, accounts, and access based on role
3. Manager receives day-one meeting checklist
4. HR tracks I-9 completion and handbook acknowledgment
5. Finance sets up payroll and benefits elections
6. Facilities orders desk setup for office location

Total time saved: 4 hours per hire, 98% fewer missed tasks

### Multi-State Compliance

A retail chain with employees in 15 states uses the integration to:

- Track state-specific training requirements
- Ensure proper tax registrations when employees relocate
- Manage varying sick leave and PTO policies
- Document state-mandated break and meal periods
- Maintain location-specific safety training records

### Seasonal Workforce Management

A hospitality company hiring 500+ seasonal workers:
