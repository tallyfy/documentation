## The gap Justworks can't fill

Justworks handles payroll, benefits, and compliance for growing companies. But when employee events happen, coordinating work across departments beyond HR still requires manual effort.

A new hire triggers paperwork and benefits in Justworks - but IT needs to provision accounts, facilities needs to prep a workspace, training needs to schedule sessions, and finance needs to set up expense access. Those handoffs happen outside Justworks entirely.

**What Justworks manages:**

- Payroll processing and PEO services
- Benefits administration and compliance
- HR support and employee records
- Time-off tracking

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Cross-department coordination beyond HR
- IT provisioning and system access
- Equipment ordering and delivery tracking
- Multi-step approval workflows
- Visibility into onboarding completion

Justworks covers HR and payroll. Tallyfy coordinates workflows across every other team involved.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

When an employee event fires in Justworks - hire, termination, role change - Tallyfy launches a structured workflow that coordinates every downstream team outside the PEO platform.

### Employee onboarding

When Justworks records a new hire, Tallyfy kicks off:
- IT account setup and equipment provisioning
- Facilities workspace and access prep
- Training schedule and compliance tracking
- Finance expense account configuration
- Team introduction workflows

### Offboarding coordination

When Justworks processes a termination, Tallyfy ensures:
- IT access revocation on the correct date
- Equipment return tracking
- Knowledge transfer workflows
- Final process documentation
