## The gap Justworks cannot fill

Justworks provides PEO services with payroll, benefits, and compliance for growing companies. But the moment employee events occur, coordination across departments beyond HR requires manual intervention.

When Justworks processes a new hire, they handle employment paperwork and benefits. But IT needs to provision accounts. Facilities needs to prepare workspace. Training needs to schedule onboarding. Finance needs expense access setup. These cross-department handoffs happen outside Justworks.

**What Justworks manages:**

- PEO services with payroll processing
- Benefits administration and compliance
- HR support and employee records
- Time-off tracking and management

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Cross-department coordination beyond HR
- IT provisioning and system access setup
- Equipment ordering and delivery tracking
- Multi-step approval workflows
- Real-time visibility into onboarding completion

Justworks handles your HR and payroll needs. But employee processes span every department. Tallyfy orchestrates workflows across ALL your teams - not just one.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

When a Justworks employee event fires - hire, termination, role change - Tallyfy launches a structured workflow that coordinates every downstream team outside the PEO platform.

### Employee onboarding

When Justworks records a new hire, Tallyfy orchestrates:
- IT account setup and equipment provisioning
- Facilities workspace and access preparation
- Training schedule and compliance tracking
- Finance expense account configuration
- Team introduction workflows

### Offboarding coordination

When Justworks processes a termination, Tallyfy ensures:
- IT access revocation on correct date
- Equipment return tracking
- Knowledge transfer workflows
- Final process documentation
