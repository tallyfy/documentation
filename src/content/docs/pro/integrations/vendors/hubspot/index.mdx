## The gap HubSpot cannot fill

HubSpot tracks your deals through pipeline stages and unifies marketing with sales. But here's what HubSpot misses: the dozens of micro-tasks that must happen between each stage transition and during the marketing-to-sales handoff.

When a marketing qualified lead becomes sales qualified in HubSpot, it looks like one status change. In reality, it requires research, discovery call scheduling, talking point preparation, and stakeholder identification. Each involves multiple people, deadlines, and conditional logic. HubSpot's workflows can automate emails - but not multi-team task coordination.

**What HubSpot manages:**

- Marketing automation and lead scoring
- Deal pipeline and stages
- Customer communications
- Reporting and analytics

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Micro-tasks between each sales stage
- Marketing-to-sales handoff coordination
- Cross-team task assignment with accountability
- Conditional workflows involving multiple departments
- Post-sale onboarding across Operations and Success teams
- Audit trails for deal execution

HubSpot shows a lead became an opportunity. Tallyfy ensures every micro-task that makes that transition successful actually happens.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap
