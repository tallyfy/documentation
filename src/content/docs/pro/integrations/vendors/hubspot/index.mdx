## The gap HubSpot can't fill

HubSpot tracks deals through pipeline stages and connects marketing with sales. But it misses the dozens of micro-tasks that need to happen between each stage change and during marketing-to-sales handoffs.

When a lead goes from marketing qualified to sales qualified in HubSpot, it looks like a single status flip. In reality, it needs research, discovery call scheduling, talking point prep, and contact mapping. Each step involves multiple people, deadlines, and conditional logic. HubSpot's workflows can send emails - but they can't coordinate tasks across teams.

**What HubSpot handles:**

- Marketing automation and lead scoring
- Deal pipeline and stages
- Customer communications
- Reporting and analytics

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Micro-tasks between sales stages
- Marketing-to-sales handoff coordination
- Cross-team task assignment with accountability
- Conditional workflows across multiple departments
- Post-sale onboarding across Operations and Success teams
- Audit trails for deal execution

HubSpot shows a lead became an opportunity. Tallyfy makes sure every micro-task behind that transition actually gets done.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

Tallyfy connects HubSpot pipeline changes with the detailed workflows that need to happen between them.
