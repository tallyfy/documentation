## The gap Zendesk cannot fill

Zendesk excels at capturing customer conversations across channels - email, chat, phone, social. But tickets are inherently unstructured. They capture what was said, not what needs to happen next.

When a support ticket requires action from multiple teams - engineering needs to investigate, product needs to evaluate, documentation needs updating - Zendesk tracks the conversation. It doesn't orchestrate the cross-team workflow that actually resolves the issue.

**What Zendesk manages:**

- Multi-channel ticket capture
- Agent assignment and routing
- Customer communication history
- Knowledge base articles

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Structured workflows after ticket creation
- Multi-team coordination with accountability
- Escalation workflows with enforced deadlines
- Post-resolution follow-up processes
- Root cause analysis workflows
- Product improvement tracking from support issues

Zendesk captures support requests. Tallyfy transforms them into structured processes that ensure nothing falls through the cracks.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

Tallyfy serves as the orchestration layer that connects Zendesk tickets with the structured workflows needed to fully resolve complex issues.

### Structured resolution workflows

When tickets need more than a reply, Tallyfy:
- Launches multi-step investigation workflows
- Assigns tasks to specific teams with deadlines
- Tracks completion across all involved parties
- Provides visibility into resolution progress

### Escalation management

When issues need escalation, Tallyfy:
- Routes to the right managers based on issue type
- Enforces SLA-driven deadlines
- Documents escalation history
- Ensures follow-through on commitments

### Post-resolution processes

When tickets close in Zendesk, Tallyfy orchestrates:
- Root cause analysis workflows
- Knowledge base update processes
- Customer follow-up sequences
- Product improvement tracking
