## The gap Zendesk can't fill

Zendesk is great at capturing customer conversations across channels - email, chat, phone, social. But tickets are unstructured. They capture what was said, not what needs to happen next.

When a ticket requires action from multiple teams - engineering investigates, product evaluates, docs need updating - Zendesk tracks the conversation. It doesn't coordinate the cross-team workflow that actually resolves the issue.

**What Zendesk handles:**

- Multi-channel ticket capture
- Agent assignment and routing
- Customer communication history
- Knowledge base articles

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Structured workflows after ticket creation
- Multi-team coordination with accountability
- Escalation workflows with enforced deadlines
- Post-resolution follow-up processes
- Root cause analysis workflows

Zendesk captures support requests. Tallyfy turns them into structured processes so nothing slips through.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

Tallyfy connects Zendesk tickets with the structured workflows needed to fully resolve complex issues.

### Structured resolution workflows

When tickets need more than a reply, Tallyfy:
- Launches multi-step investigation workflows
- Assigns tasks to specific teams with deadlines
- Tracks completion across all involved parties
- Shows resolution progress in real time

### Escalation management

When issues need escalation, Tallyfy:
- Routes to the right managers based on issue type
- Enforces SLA-driven deadlines
- Documents escalation history
- Ensures follow-through on commitments

### Post-resolution processes

After tickets close in Zendesk, Tallyfy handles:
- Root cause analysis workflows
- Knowledge base update processes
- Customer follow-up sequences
- Product improvement tracking
