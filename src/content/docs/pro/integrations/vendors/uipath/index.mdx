## Where UiPath falls short

UiPath is great at automating repetitive, rule-based tasks on screens. But most business processes need BOTH automated AND human activities - and UiPath can't coordinate both.

A UiPath bot extracts data from an invoice. What happens next? Who reviews exceptions? How do you track whether the full process actually completed? UiPath automates individual tasks - it doesn't connect entire processes that span bots and people.

**What UiPath automates:**

- Screen scraping and data extraction
- Form filling and data entry
- Rule-based decisions on structured data
- Legacy system interactions via UI

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Handoffs between bots and human workers
- Exceptions requiring human judgment
- End-to-end visibility across automated and manual steps
- Accountability for process outcomes
- Routing to different teams based on exceptions

UiPath automates tasks. Tallyfy coordinates processes - combining bots and humans in unified workflows with full visibility.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

Tallyfy acts as the coordination layer connecting UiPath with human workflows to create end-to-end process automation.

### Process coordination

When UiPath bots run, Tallyfy:
- Triggers the right bot at the right time via webhooks
- Routes exceptions to human reviewers immediately
- Tracks completion across all steps - automated and manual
- Escalates when SLAs are at risk

### Human-bot handoffs

Tallyfy manages smooth transitions:
- Bot completes data extraction → Tallyfy assigns human review
- Human approves exception → Tallyfy triggers next bot via Orchestrator API
- Full audit trail of who did what and when

### Exception management

When UiPath hits something it can't handle:
- Tallyfy receives the exception notification
- Routes it to the right human reviewer
- Tracks resolution time and outcome
- Resumes automation once the exception is resolved

## Connect today

<Aside type="note" title="Integration Status">
Native UiPath integration is planned. Connect via Orchestrator API or webhooks today.
</Aside>

**UiPath Orchestrator API**: Trigger UiPath jobs from Tallyfy webhooks and receive completion notifications.

**Middleware**: Connect via [Zapier](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/zapier/) or [Power Automate](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/) for simpler setups.

**API**: Use [Tallyfy's API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) to trigger workflows when bots complete and call Orchestrator endpoints when human tasks finish.
