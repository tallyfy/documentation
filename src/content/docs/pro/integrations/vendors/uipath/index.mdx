## The gap UiPath cannot fill

UiPath excels at automating repetitive, rule-based tasks on screens. But most business processes require BOTH automated AND human activities - and UiPath cannot orchestrate both.

When a UiPath bot completes data extraction from an invoice, what happens next? Who reviews exceptions? What if the bot encounters an edge case? How do you track whether the full process completed? UiPath automates individual tasks - it cannot coordinate entire processes that span bots and humans.

**What UiPath automates:**

- Screen scraping and data extraction
- Form filling and data entry
- Rule-based decisions on structured data
- Legacy system interactions via UI

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Handoffs between bots and human workers
- Exception handling requiring human judgment
- End-to-end process visibility across automated and manual steps
- Accountability for process outcomes
- Conditional routing to different teams based on exceptions
- Coordination across multiple bots and humans

UiPath automates tasks. Tallyfy orchestrates processes - combining bots and humans in unified workflows with complete visibility.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

Tallyfy serves as the orchestration layer that connects UiPath with human workflows, creating end-to-end process automation.

### Process orchestration

When UiPath bots execute, Tallyfy:
- Triggers the right bot at the right time via webhooks
- Routes exceptions to human reviewers immediately
- Tracks completion across all steps - automated and manual
- Escalates when SLAs are at risk

### Human-bot handoffs

Tallyfy manages seamless transitions:
- Bot completes data extraction → Tallyfy assigns human review
- Human approves exception → Tallyfy triggers next bot via Orchestrator API
- Complete audit trail of who did what and when

### Exception management

When UiPath encounters something it cannot handle:
- Tallyfy receives the exception notification
- Routes to the appropriate human reviewer
- Tracks resolution time and outcome
- Resumes automation once exception is resolved

## Connect today

<Aside type="note" title="Integration Status">
Native UiPath integration is planned. Connect via Orchestrator API or webhooks today.
</Aside>

**UiPath Orchestrator API**: Trigger UiPath jobs from Tallyfy webhooks and receive completion notifications.

**Middleware**: Connect via [Zapier](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/zapier/) or [Power Automate](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/) for simpler integration patterns.

**API**: Use [Tallyfy's API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) to trigger workflows when bots complete and call Orchestrator endpoints when human tasks finish.
