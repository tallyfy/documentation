## The gap Salesforce cannot fill

Salesforce tracks your deals through pipeline stages - Lead, Qualified, Proposal, Negotiation, Closed Won. But here's what Salesforce misses: the dozens of micro-tasks that must happen between each stage transition.

When a deal moves from "Qualified" to "Proposal" in Salesforce, it looks like one click. In reality, it's a cascade of coordinated activities: technical reviews, pricing approvals, legal checks, resource allocation, competitor analysis, and demo preparation. Each involves multiple people, deadlines, and conditional logic. Salesforce can't track any of this.

**What Salesforce manages:**

- Customer and contact data
- Opportunity pipeline and stages
- Sales activities and communications
- Forecasting and reporting

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Micro-tasks between each sales stage
- Cross-team handoffs (Sales → Legal → Finance → Operations)
- Deadline enforcement on internal deal tasks
- Conditional workflows based on deal size or type
- Post-sale onboarding coordination
- Audit trails for deal execution

Two deals at the same stage in Salesforce can have completely different outcomes. The difference? Execution of the micro-tasks between stages. Tallyfy makes these invisible tasks visible, trackable, and automatic.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

Tallyfy serves as the orchestration layer that connects Salesforce stage changes with the detailed workflows that must happen between them.

### Micro-task orchestration

When deals move through Salesforce stages, Tallyfy:
- Launches the right workflow for each stage transition
- Assigns tasks to the right people with deadlines
- Routes work based on deal characteristics (size, type, region)
- Tracks completion across all stakeholders

### Cross-team coordination

Tallyfy handles handoffs Salesforce cannot:
- Sales qualifies deal → Technical team scopes requirements
- Pricing approved → Legal reviews contract terms
- Deal closed → Operations begins onboarding
- Complete visibility across all teams

### Post-sale workflows

When deals close in Salesforce, Tallyfy orchestrates:
- Customer onboarding sequences
- Implementation project kickoff
- Account provisioning and access setup
- Training and enablement scheduling
