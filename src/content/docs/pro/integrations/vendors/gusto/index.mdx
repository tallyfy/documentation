## The gap Gusto cannot fill

Gusto handles payroll, benefits, and HR for small and mid-sized businesses. But Gusto's modules require manual reconciliation, and it cannot coordinate the IT provisioning, training, and facilities setup that new hires need.

When someone is hired in Gusto, the system processes their payroll and benefits. But it cannot tell IT to create their email account. It cannot schedule their orientation or set up their expense access. These coordination tasks happen in separate systems through manual handoffs.

**What Gusto manages:**

- Payroll processing and tax filing
- Benefits administration
- Time-off tracking
- Basic onboarding paperwork (offer letters, e-signatures)

**What falls through the cracks:**

- IT provisioning and system account setup
- Module synchronization requiring manual reconciliation
- Timesheet exceptions and complex shift handling
- Cross-department coordination for Facilities and Training
- Structured workflows beyond basic onboarding checklists

Gusto serves your HR and payroll needs. But employee processes span every department. Tallyfy orchestrates workflows across ALL your teams - not just one.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

When a Gusto employee event fires - hire, termination, status change - Tallyfy launches a structured workflow that coordinates every downstream team.

### Employee onboarding

When Gusto records a new hire, Tallyfy orchestrates:
- IT email and system account creation
- Equipment provisioning based on role
- Training schedule and compliance tracking
- Finance expense account setup
- Manager introduction workflows

### Payroll coordination

When Gusto processes payroll events, Tallyfy handles:
- Exception approval workflows for overtime
- Expense report routing and approval chains
- Benefits change validations
- Multi-step approval for compensation adjustments
