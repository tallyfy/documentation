## The gap Gusto can't fill

Gusto handles payroll, benefits, and HR for small and mid-sized businesses - but it can't coordinate the IT provisioning, training, or facilities setup that new hires actually need.

When someone's hired in Gusto, payroll and benefits get processed. But nobody in IT gets told to create an email account. Orientation doesn't get scheduled. Expense access doesn't get set up. These tasks live in separate systems and depend on manual handoffs.

**What Gusto manages:**

- Payroll processing and tax filing
- Benefits administration
- Time-off tracking
- Basic onboarding paperwork (offer letters, e-signatures)

**What falls through the cracks:**

- IT provisioning and system account setup
- Cross-department coordination for Facilities and Training
- Timesheet exceptions and complex shift handling
- Structured workflows beyond basic onboarding checklists

Gusto covers HR and payroll. But employee processes span every department. Tallyfy runs workflows across all your teams - not just one.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

When a Gusto employee event fires - hire, termination, status change - Tallyfy launches a structured workflow that coordinates every downstream team.

### Employee onboarding

When Gusto records a new hire, Tallyfy kicks off:
- IT email and system account creation
- Equipment provisioning based on role
- Training schedule and compliance tracking
- Finance expense account setup
- Manager introduction workflows

### Payroll coordination

When Gusto processes payroll events, Tallyfy handles:
- Exception approval workflows for overtime
- Expense report routing and approval chains
- Benefits change validations
- Multi-step approval for compensation adjustments
