## The orchestration layer your vendors need

Your HR, Finance, and collaboration platforms excel at their core functions. But they cannot coordinate cross-department processes.

When someone is hired in your HR system, IT needs to provision accounts. Facilities needs workspace setup. Training needs to schedule orientation. Finance needs expense configuration. These handoffs happen through email and manual tracking - not the vendor platform.

Tallyfy fills this gap by orchestrating workflows across ALL your teams, not just within one vendor's ecosystem.

## How vendor integrations work

<Aside type="note" title="Integration Status">
Most vendor integrations are planned. Currently, the primary connection method is via middleware platforms like [Zapier](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/zapier/), [Power Automate](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/), or [Make](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/make/). Native integrations with [Slack](/products/pro/integrations/vendors/slack/) are available.
</Aside>

When vendor events occur - new hire, payroll run, message shared - Tallyfy can launch structured workflows that:

- Coordinate multiple departments automatically
- Assign tasks with clear ownership and deadlines
- Track progress across all stakeholders
- Escalate when actions are delayed
- Document completion for compliance

## The gap Tallyfy fills

**HR systems** manage employee data but cannot coordinate IT provisioning, Facilities setup, or Training schedules when someone joins or leaves.

**Finance systems** process transactions but cannot orchestrate multi-stakeholder approvals, month-end close coordination, or reconciliation workflows.

**Communication tools** enable conversations but cannot ensure accountability, track action items, or enforce deadlines.

**RPA platforms** automate repetitive tasks on screens but cannot orchestrate the human activities that happen before, during, and after bot execution. Exception handling, human approvals, and bot-human handoffs all require coordination.

Tallyfy works WITH these vendors as the orchestration layer that coordinates processes spanning multiple teams and systems.

## RPA orchestration

RPA platforms like UiPath, Automation Anywhere, and Blue Prism excel at automating repetitive, rule-based tasks. But most processes require BOTH automated AND human activities. Tallyfy provides the orchestration layer that connects bots with human workflows.

**What RPA automates:**
- Screen scraping and data extraction
- Form filling and data entry
- Rule-based decisions
- Legacy system interactions

**What Tallyfy adds:**
- Human-bot handoffs and exception routing
- End-to-end process visibility
- Accountability for process outcomes
- SLA tracking across automated and manual steps
