## Direct vendor integrations

Tallyfy provides native integrations with specific vendors to streamline your workflow automation. These pre-built connectors eliminate the need for middleware platforms or custom API development when connecting with these popular business applications.

### What are vendor integrations?

Vendor integrations are direct, purpose-built connections between Tallyfy and specific third-party applications. Unlike generic API or middleware approaches, these integrations are optimized for each vendor's unique capabilities and use cases.

Each vendor integration provides:
- **Native functionality** - Features designed specifically for that platform
- **Simplified setup** - No coding or middleware configuration required
- **Optimized performance** - Direct connections without intermediary layers
- **Vendor-specific features** - Leverage unique capabilities of each platform
- **Maintained compatibility** - Updates handled automatically as vendors evolve

### Why use vendor integrations?

**Speed of deployment**: Get up and running in minutes, not days. Pre-built connectors mean no custom development or complex configuration.

**Lower total cost**: Eliminate middleware licensing fees and reduce maintenance overhead. Direct integrations mean fewer systems to manage.

**Better user experience**: Native integrations feel seamless. Your team works in familiar tools while Tallyfy handles the workflow orchestration behind the scenes.

**Reliability**: Direct connections mean fewer points of failure. No middleware downtime or API gateway issues to worry about.

### Vendor integration vs. other approaches

| Integration Type | Best For | Setup Time | Technical Skills |
|-----------------|----------|------------|------------------|
| **Vendor Integration** | Popular platforms with native support | Minutes | None required |
| **Middleware** (Zapier, etc.) | Connecting multiple systems | Hours | Basic |
| **API Integration** | Custom requirements | Days/Weeks | Developer needed |
| **Webhooks** | Real-time events | Hours | Technical |

### Getting started with vendor integrations

1. **Check availability** - Browse the vendor integrations below to see if your platform is supported
2. **Review requirements** - Each integration has specific account requirements (subscription level, permissions)
3. **Follow setup guide** - Detailed instructions walk you through connection and configuration
4. **Test the integration** - Run test workflows to ensure everything connects properly
5. **Deploy to production** - Roll out to your team with confidence

### Integration capabilities

Vendor integrations typically support:

**Process triggers**:
- Launch Tallyfy processes from vendor events
- Start workflows based on specific conditions
- Automate process initiation without manual intervention

**Task management**:
- Create tasks in vendor platforms
- Update task status bidirectionally
- Assign work based on vendor data

**Data synchronization**:
- Pass information between systems
- Keep records updated across platforms
- Maintain single source of truth

**Notifications**:
- Send alerts through vendor channels
- Receive updates in preferred tools
- Centralize communication streams

### Coming soon

We're continuously adding new vendor integrations based on customer demand. If you need an integration that's not currently available, consider:

1. **Requesting the integration** - Contact [Tallyfy support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/) to express interest
2. **Using middleware** - [Zapier](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/zapier/) or [Power Automate](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/) as temporary solutions
3. **API development** - Build custom integrations using our [REST API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/)

### Security and compliance

All vendor integrations maintain enterprise-grade security:
- OAuth 2.0 authentication where supported
- Encrypted data transmission
- No credential storage in Tallyfy
- Audit trails for all activities
- Compliance with vendor security requirements
