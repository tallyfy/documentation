## The coordination layer your vendors need

Your HR, Finance, and collaboration platforms are great at their core functions. But they can't coordinate cross-department processes.

When someone's hired in your HR system, IT needs to provision accounts. Facilities needs workspace setup. Training needs to schedule orientation. Finance needs expense configuration. These handoffs happen through email and manual tracking - not the vendor platform.

Tallyfy fills this gap by coordinating workflows across ALL your teams, not just within one vendor's world.

## How vendor integrations work

<Aside type="note" title="Integration Status">
Most vendor integrations are planned. Currently, the primary connection method is via middleware platforms like [Zapier](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/zapier/), [Power Automate](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/), or [Make](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/make/). Native integrations with [Slack](/products/pro/integrations/vendors/slack/) are available.
</Aside>

When vendor events occur - new hire, payroll run, message shared - Tallyfy can launch structured workflows that:

- Coordinate multiple departments automatically
- Assign tasks with clear ownership and deadlines
- Track progress across all stakeholders
- Escalate when actions are delayed

## Available vendor connections

## The gap Tallyfy fills

**CRM systems** track deals through pipeline stages but can't coordinate micro-tasks between stages - proposal development, technical scoping, pricing approvals, contract reviews, and post-sale handoffs.

**Helpdesk tools** capture tickets and conversations but can't turn unstructured requests into structured process funnels with clear accountability and deadlines.

**HR systems** manage employee data but can't coordinate IT provisioning, Facilities setup, or Training schedules when someone joins or leaves.

**Finance systems** process transactions but can't handle multi-party approvals, month-end close coordination, or reconciliation workflows.

**Communication tools** enable conversations but can't ensure accountability, track action items, or enforce deadlines.

**RPA platforms** automate repetitive screen tasks but can't coordinate the human activities before, during, and after bot execution. Exception handling, approvals, and bot-human handoffs all need coordination.

Tallyfy works WITH these vendors as the coordination layer for processes spanning multiple teams and systems.

## CRM coordination

CRM platforms are great at tracking deals and customer relationships. But deals need more than tracking - they need coordinated tasks across multiple teams that CRMs can't handle.

**What CRMs track:**
- Pipeline stages and deal values
- Customer interactions and communications
- Sales activities and forecasts
- Contact and account data

**What Tallyfy adds:**
- Micro-tasks between each sales stage
- Cross-team proposal and contract workflows
- Approval chains for pricing exceptions
- Post-sale handoffs to Operations and Success
- Audit trails for deal execution

## Helpdesk coordination

Helpdesk platforms capture support tickets and conversations. But complex issues need more than replies - they need structured workflows that turn ticket chaos into process funnels.

**What helpdesks capture:**
- Support tickets and conversations
- Agent assignments and SLAs
- Customer communication history
- Knowledge base articles

**What Tallyfy adds:**
- Structured multi-team resolution workflows
- Escalation processes with enforced deadlines
- Post-resolution follow-up sequences
- Root cause analysis workflows
- Product improvement tracking

- [Help Scout](/products/pro/integrations/vendors/help-scout/)

## RPA coordination

RPA platforms like UiPath, Automation Anywhere, and Blue Prism are great at automating repetitive, rule-based tasks. But most processes need BOTH automated AND human activities. Tallyfy provides the coordination layer that connects bots with human workflows.

**What RPA automates:**
- Screen scraping and data extraction
- Form filling and data entry
- Rule-based decisions
- Legacy system interactions

**What Tallyfy adds:**
- Human-bot handoffs and exception routing
- Full process visibility
- Accountability for outcomes
- SLA tracking across automated and manual steps
