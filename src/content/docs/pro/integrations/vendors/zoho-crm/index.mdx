## The gap Zoho CRM can't fill

Zoho CRM tracks deals through pipeline stages as part of the broader Zoho ecosystem. But the micro-tasks between sales stages need coordination that spans people and departments - not just apps.

When a deal moves from qualification to proposal, multiple team members must complete tasks in sequence. Technical scoping, pricing approval, legal review, resource allocation - each needs assignment, deadlines, and accountability. Zoho's Blueprint workflows handle simple sequences, but they don't cover cross-department coordination.

**What Zoho CRM manages:**

- Lead and contact management
- Deal pipeline and stages
- Sales automation (Blueprint)
- Suite integration (Zoho One)

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Micro-tasks between each sales stage
- Cross-department handoffs with accountability
- Approval chains beyond simple approvals
- Involvement of non-Zoho users in workflows
- Post-sale onboarding spanning multiple teams
- Audit trails for deal execution

Zoho CRM automates within its ecosystem. Tallyfy coordinates across all your teams - whether they use Zoho or not.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap
