## The gap Zoho CRM cannot fill

Zoho CRM tracks your deals through pipeline stages as part of the broader Zoho ecosystem. But even with Zoho's extensive suite, the micro-tasks between sales stages require coordination that spans people and departments - not just apps.

When a deal moves from qualification to proposal in Zoho CRM, multiple team members need to complete specific tasks in sequence. Technical scoping, pricing approval, legal review, resource allocation - each requires assignment, deadlines, and accountability. Zoho's Blueprint workflows help with simple sequences, but not complex cross-department coordination.

**What Zoho CRM manages:**

- Lead and contact management
- Deal pipeline and stages
- Sales automation (Blueprint)
- Suite integration (Zoho One)

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Micro-tasks between each sales stage
- Cross-department handoffs with accountability
- Complex approval chains beyond simple approvals
- Involvement of non-Zoho users in workflows
- Post-sale onboarding spanning multiple teams
- Audit trails for deal execution

Zoho CRM automates within its ecosystem. Tallyfy orchestrates across all your teams - whether they use Zoho or not.
