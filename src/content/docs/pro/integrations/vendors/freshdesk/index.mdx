## The gap Freshdesk cannot fill

Freshdesk streamlines helpdesk operations with ticket management, automations, and a knowledge base. But tickets remain fundamentally unstructured - they capture conversations, not the multi-step workflows needed to resolve complex issues.

When a Freshdesk ticket requires investigation by engineering, approval from management, or coordination across departments, the ticket becomes a conversation thread. Freshdesk tracks what was discussed. It doesn't orchestrate the work that needs to happen.

**What Freshdesk manages:**

- Ticket creation and assignment
- SLA tracking and automation
- Customer communication
- Agent productivity metrics

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Multi-team resolution workflows
- Approval chains for exceptions
- Structured data collection at each step
- Post-ticket follow-up processes
- Systematic improvement workflows
- Cross-department handoffs with accountability

Freshdesk organizes your support queue. Tallyfy structures the work that resolves complex tickets completely.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

Tallyfy serves as the orchestration layer that connects Freshdesk tickets with the structured workflows needed for complete resolution.

### Multi-team coordination

When tickets require multiple teams, Tallyfy:
- Launches parallel workflows to involved departments
- Assigns specific tasks with deadlines
- Tracks completion across all contributors
- Aggregates results back to the support team

### Exception handling

When tickets need special handling, Tallyfy:
- Routes approval requests to appropriate managers
- Handles multi-level approval chains
- Documents decision history
- Enforces compliance requirements

### Systematic improvement

When patterns emerge from tickets, Tallyfy orchestrates:
- Root cause analysis workflows
- Product bug tracking processes
- Documentation improvement workflows
- Training needs identification
