## What Freshdesk can't do

Freshdesk handles ticket management, automations, and knowledge bases well. But tickets are unstructured - they capture conversations, not the multi-step workflows you need to actually resolve complex issues.

When a ticket needs engineering investigation, management approval, or cross-department coordination, it turns into a conversation thread. Freshdesk tracks what was discussed. It doesn't manage the work that needs to happen.

**What Freshdesk covers:**

- Ticket creation and assignment
- SLA tracking and automation
- Customer communication
- Agent productivity metrics

**What's missing:**

- Multi-team resolution workflows
- Approval chains for exceptions
- Structured data collection at each step
- Post-ticket follow-up processes
- Cross-department handoffs with accountability

Freshdesk organizes your support queue. Tallyfy structures the work that actually resolves complex tickets.

## How Tallyfy fills the gap

Tallyfy acts as the coordination layer between Freshdesk tickets and the structured workflows needed for complete resolution.

### Multi-team coordination

When tickets require multiple teams, Tallyfy:
- Launches parallel workflows to involved departments
- Assigns specific tasks with deadlines
- Tracks completion across all contributors
- Sends results back to the support team

### Exception handling

When tickets need special handling, Tallyfy:
- Routes approval requests to the right managers
- Handles multi-level approval chains
- Documents decision history
- Enforces compliance requirements

### Improvement workflows

When patterns emerge from tickets, Tallyfy runs:
- Root cause analysis workflows
- Bug tracking processes
- Documentation update workflows
- Training needs identification
