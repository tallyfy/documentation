## The gap TriNet cannot fill

TriNet provides comprehensive PEO services - handling payroll, benefits, and HR compliance for SMBs. But PEO services focus on HR administration, not coordinating the business processes that employee events trigger.

When TriNet processes a new hire, they handle the employment paperwork. But IT needs to create accounts. Facilities needs to prepare workspace. Training needs to schedule orientation. Finance needs to set up expense access. TriNet cannot coordinate these cross-department handoffs.

**What TriNet manages:**

- Co-employment and payroll processing
- Benefits administration and compliance
- HR consulting and risk management
- Employee records and documentation

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Cross-department coordination beyond HR
- IT provisioning and system access setup
- Facilities and workspace preparation
- Training schedule coordination
- Multi-stakeholder approval workflows

TriNet serves your HR outsourcing needs. But business processes span every department. Tallyfy orchestrates workflows across ALL your teams - not just one.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

When a TriNet employee event fires - hire, termination, status change - Tallyfy launches a structured workflow that coordinates stakeholders both inside and outside the PEO relationship.

### Employee onboarding

When TriNet records a new hire, Tallyfy orchestrates:
- IT account and system access provisioning
- Equipment ordering and delivery tracking
- Training enrollment and compliance tracking
- Finance expense and corporate card setup
- Manager welcome and introduction workflows

### Offboarding coordination

When TriNet processes a termination, Tallyfy ensures:
- IT access revocation on the correct date
- Equipment return tracking
- Knowledge transfer workflows
- Exit interview scheduling
