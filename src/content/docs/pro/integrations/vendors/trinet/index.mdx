## Quick Summary

We're integrating with TriNet to transform PEO data into automated workflows that handle everything from employee onboarding to compliance tracking. When you add employees, process payroll, or manage benefits in TriNet, Tallyfy automatically orchestrates all the surrounding business processes - ensuring nothing falls through the cracks while you focus on growing your business.

<Aside type="note" title="New Marketplace Launch">
TriNet launched their curated marketplace in June 2024 with pre-built integrations and expanded API access. While we work toward official partnership, you can integrate today using their customer APIs.
</Aside>

## Why This Integration Matters

TriNet handles the complex world of HR compliance, payroll, and benefits for SMBs. But your business processes extend far beyond what any PEO can manage - onboarding checklists, equipment provisioning, training schedules, and operational workflows.

Without integration, your team manually coordinates between TriNet and your other systems. Our integration makes TriNet events automatically trigger the right workflows, ensuring smooth operations without the manual work.

## What We're Building

### Complete Onboarding Automation

Transform new hire chaos into organized execution:

- **Pre-Start Preparation**: As soon as someone's entered in TriNet, trigger workspace setup, equipment orders, and team notifications
- **First Day Excellence**: Pull role and department data to configure access, assign mentors, and schedule orientation
- **Benefits Coordination**: Sync enrollment deadlines and choices with follow-up workflows
- **Compliance Tracking**: Ensure I-9, handbook acknowledgments, and state requirements are met

### Payroll and Time Management

Connect payroll processing to business workflows:

- **Timesheet Workflows**: Route approvals based on hours, projects, or exceptions
- **Payroll Reconciliation**: Automate accounting entries and cost allocations
- **Commission Processing**: Multi-tier approval workflows for variable compensation
- **Expense Management**: Integrate expense reports with payroll processing

### Global Workforce Support (New 2024)

Leverage TriNet's new global partnerships:

- **International Hiring**: Coordinate visa, relocation, and onboarding workflows
- **Multi-Country Compliance**: Track requirements across jurisdictions
- **Global Payroll Coordination**: Unified workflows for US and international employees
- **Remote Work Management**: Equipment shipping and time zone coordination

## How to Connect Today
