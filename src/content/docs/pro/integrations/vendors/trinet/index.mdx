## The gap TriNet can't fill

TriNet provides full PEO services - payroll, benefits, and HR compliance for SMBs. But PEO services focus on HR administration, not coordinating the business processes that employee events trigger.

When TriNet processes a new hire, they handle the employment paperwork. IT still needs to create accounts. Facilities needs to prepare a workspace. Training needs to schedule orientation. Finance needs to set up expense access. TriNet can't coordinate these cross - department handoffs.

**What TriNet manages:**

- Co - employment and payroll processing
- Benefits administration and compliance
- HR consulting and risk management
- Employee records and documentation

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Cross - department coordination beyond HR
- IT provisioning and system access setup
- Facilities and workspace preparation
- Training schedule coordination
- Multi - team approval workflows

TriNet handles your HR outsourcing needs - but business processes span every department. Tallyfy coordinates workflows across all your teams, not just one.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

When a TriNet employee event fires - hire, termination, status change - Tallyfy launches a structured workflow that coordinates people both inside and outside the PEO relationship.

### Employee onboarding

When TriNet records a new hire, Tallyfy coordinates:
- IT account and system access provisioning
- Equipment ordering and delivery tracking
- Training enrollment and compliance tracking
- Finance expense and corporate card setup
- Manager welcome and introduction workflows

### Offboarding coordination

When TriNet processes a termination, Tallyfy ensures:
- IT access revocation on the correct date
- Equipment return tracking
- Knowledge transfer workflows
- Exit interview scheduling
