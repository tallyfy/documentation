## What Blue Prism doesn't cover

Blue Prism's digital workforce handles complex automation with strong governance. But even the best bots can't handle every scenario - human judgment is still needed for exceptions, approvals, and edge cases.

When a Blue Prism bot processes loan applications, edge cases need human review. When it reconciles accounts, discrepancies require investigation. When it processes claims, complex cases need underwriter judgment. Blue Prism manages bots - not the humans who work alongside them.

**What Blue Prism automates:**

- Digital workforce management at scale
- Multi-step automation sequences
- Secure credential management
- Compliance logging for bot activities

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Governance over combined human-bot processes
- Coordination between bots and human teams
- Exception workflows that need human judgment
- Full process accountability spanning both sides
- Changing human steps without code changes
- SLA tracking across the entire human-bot workflow

Blue Prism governs digital workers. Tallyfy coordinates those digital workers WITH human workers in unified, governed processes.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

Tallyfy connects Blue Prism with human workflows, extending governance across your entire process.

### Extended governance

When Blue Prism bots run, Tallyfy extends governance to:
- Human activities that follow bot work
- Exception handling procedures
- Approval workflows triggered by bot outputs
- Audit trails spanning bots and humans

### Bot-human coordination

Tallyfy manages handoffs between bots and people:
- Bot completes task - Tallyfy assigns human review
- Human approves - Tallyfy triggers the next bot
- Full accountability chain maintained throughout

### Exception handling

When bots hit exceptions:
- Tallyfy receives notifications via webhook
- Routes to the right human specialist based on exception type
- Tracks resolution time and method
- Sends data back to Blue Prism when it's ready to resume
