## The gap Blue Prism cannot fill

Blue Prism's enterprise-grade digital workforce handles complex automation with strong governance. But even the most sophisticated digital workers cannot handle every scenario - human judgment is still required for exceptions, approvals, and edge cases.

When a Blue Prism digital worker processes loan applications, edge cases need human review. When it reconciles accounts, discrepancies require human investigation. When it processes claims, complex cases need underwriter judgment. Blue Prism orchestrates bots - not the humans who work alongside them.

**What Blue Prism automates:**

- Enterprise-scale digital workforce management
- Complex multi-step automation sequences
- Secure credential management
- Governance and compliance logging for bot activities

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Governance over combined human-bot processes
- Coordination between digital workers and human teams
- Exception workflows requiring human judgment
- End-to-end process accountability spanning both
- Flexibility to modify human steps without code changes
- SLA tracking across the entire human-bot workflow

Blue Prism governs digital workers. Tallyfy provides the orchestration layer that coordinates digital workers WITH human workers in unified, governed processes.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

Tallyfy serves as the orchestration layer that connects Blue Prism with human workflows, extending governance across your entire process.

### Extended governance

When Blue Prism digital workers execute, Tallyfy extends governance to:
- Human activities that follow bot work
- Exception handling procedures
- Approval workflows triggered by bot outputs
- Complete audit trails spanning bots and humans

### Bot-human coordination

Tallyfy manages seamless handoffs:
- Digital worker completes task → Tallyfy assigns human review
- Human approves → Tallyfy triggers next digital worker
- Full accountability chain maintained throughout

### Flexible exception handling

When digital workers encounter exceptions:
- Tallyfy receives exception notifications via webhook
- Routes to appropriate human specialist based on exception type
- Tracks resolution time and method
- Provides data back to Blue Prism when ready to resume
