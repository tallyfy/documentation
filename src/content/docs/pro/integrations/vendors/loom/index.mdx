## Quick Summary

We're integrating with Loom to transform async video communication into structured workflows. When someone records a Loom for training, feedback, or updates, Tallyfy automatically orchestrates the follow-up actions - acknowledgments, responses, task creation, and documentation - ensuring video content drives actual outcomes, not just views.

<Aside type="caution" title="Limited API Access">
Loom doesn't offer an open API currently, but provides an SDK for embedding recording capabilities. We work around this limitation using webhook automation and video link detection to trigger workflows.
</Aside>

## Why This Integration Matters

Loom revolutionized async communication with quick video messages. But videos alone don't ensure action. Training videos need acknowledgment tracking. Feedback videos need response workflows. Update videos need task extraction. Documentation videos need organization.

Our integration bridges this gap. Record in Loom, trigger workflows in Tallyfy. Your videos become the start of structured processes that ensure communication leads to completion.

## What We're Building

### Training and Onboarding Workflows

Transform training videos into trackable programs:

- **Video Course Management**: Loom recordings trigger learning path workflows
- **Acknowledgment Tracking**: Ensure employees watch and confirm understanding
- **Quiz Integration**: Video completion triggers knowledge checks
- **Progress Monitoring**: Track who's completed which training modules

### Feedback and Review Cycles

Turn video feedback into action:

- **Design Reviews**: Loom feedback triggers revision workflows
- **Code Reviews**: Video walkthroughs trigger PR update tasks
- **Performance Feedback**: Manager videos trigger improvement plans
- **Customer Feedback**: Support Looms trigger resolution workflows

### Documentation and Knowledge Management

Organize video knowledge systematically:

- **Process Documentation**: Loom tutorials trigger SOP creation
- **Knowledge Base Updates**: New videos trigger categorization workflows
- **FAQ Creation**: Common question videos trigger article workflows
- **Update Notifications**: Documentation videos trigger team alerts

## How to Connect Today

### Option 1: Loom SDK Integration

Embed recording directly in workflows:

```javascript
// Example: Embed Loom recording in Tallyfy workflow
import { createInstance } from '@loomhq/loom-sdk';

const initializeLoomInWorkflow = async (workflowStep) => {
  // Initialize Loom SDK
  const loomSDK = await createInstance({
    appId: 'YOUR_LOOM_APP_ID',
    buttonId: 'loom-record-button'
  });
  
  // Handle recording completion
  loomSDK.on('insert-click', async (video) => {
    // Create follow-up workflow with video
    const workflow = await fetch('https://api.tallyfy.com/v1/workflows', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TALLYFY_KEY',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        template_id: 'video_followup',
        name: `Review - ${video.title}`,
        data: {
          video_url: video.shareUrl,
          video_id: video.id,
          video_title: video.title,
          duration: video.duration,
          recorder_name: video.creatorName,
          recording_date: new Date().toISOString(),
          workflow_context: workflowStep.context,
          required_viewers: workflowStep.assignedTo,
          completion_deadline: workflowStep.dueDate
        }
      })
    });
    
    return workflow.json();
  });
};
```

### Option 2: Link Detection Automation

Detect Loom links and trigger workflows:

```javascript
// Monitor for Loom links in various channels
const detectLoomAndCreateWorkflow = async (message) => {
  const loomRegex = /(?:https?:\/\/)?(?:www\.)?loom\.com\/share\/([a-zA-Z0-9]+)/g;
  const matches = message.content.match(loomRegex);
  
  if (matches) {
    for (const loomUrl of matches) {
      // Extract video ID
      const videoId = loomUrl.split('/').pop();
      
      // Determine workflow type based on context
      const workflowType = determineWorkflowType(message.channel, message.tags);
      
      // Create appropriate workflow
      await createVideoWorkflow(loomUrl, videoId, workflowType, message);
    }
  }
};
```

### Option 3: Integration Platforms
