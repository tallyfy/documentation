## The gap Loom cannot fill

Loom revolutionized async video communication. But videos are conversations - not processes. Watching a video does not ensure action happened.

When someone records a training video in Loom, it gets watched (maybe). But who confirmed understanding? What tasks resulted? When someone shares feedback via Loom, does the recipient have a deadline? Is there accountability for action? These process coordination gaps exist between video communication and actual execution.

**What Loom manages:**

- Video recording and sharing
- View tracking and analytics
- Comments and reactions
- Video organization and libraries

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Acknowledgment with accountability
- Task extraction from video content
- Deadline enforcement for responses
- Multi-step workflows triggered by videos
- Compliance documentation for training completion

Loom enables video communication. But communication alone does not drive action. Tallyfy turns video content into trackable workflows with clear ownership.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

When a Loom video is shared - for training, feedback, or updates - Tallyfy launches a structured workflow that ensures communication leads to completion.

### Training workflows

When training videos are shared, Tallyfy orchestrates:
- Acknowledgment tracking with deadlines
- Comprehension verification steps
- Follow-up task assignment
- Compliance documentation

### Feedback workflows

When feedback videos are shared, Tallyfy handles:
- Response deadline enforcement
- Action item extraction and assignment
- Revision tracking and approval
- Completion confirmation

<Aside type="note" title="Integration Status">
Native Loom integration is planned. Loom currently offers an SDK for embedding recording capabilities rather than an open API.
</Aside>

**Middleware**: Connect via [Zapier](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/zapier/) or [Make](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/make/) to trigger workflows when Loom videos are recorded.

**Link Detection**: Configure Slack or email integrations to detect Loom URLs and trigger appropriate workflows.

**API**: Build custom integration using [Tallyfy's API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) with Loom SDK for embedded recording.
