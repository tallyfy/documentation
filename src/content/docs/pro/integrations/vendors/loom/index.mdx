## The gap Loom can't fill

Loom changed async video communication. But videos are conversations - not processes. Watching a video doesn't guarantee anything actually happened.

Someone records a training video in Loom. It gets watched (maybe). But who confirmed they understood it? What tasks came out of it? When someone shares feedback via Loom, does the recipient have a deadline? Is anyone held accountable? There's a real gap between video communication and actual execution.

**What Loom handles:**

- Video recording and sharing
- View tracking and analytics
- Comments and reactions
- Video libraries

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Acknowledgment with accountability
- Task extraction from video content
- Deadline enforcement for responses
- Multi-step workflows triggered by videos
- Compliance records for training completion

Loom is great for video communication. But communication alone doesn't drive action. Tallyfy turns video content into trackable workflows with clear ownership.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

When a Loom video is shared - for training, feedback, or updates - Tallyfy launches a structured workflow that turns communication into completed work.

### Training workflows

When training videos are shared, Tallyfy runs:
- Acknowledgment tracking with deadlines
- Comprehension verification steps
- Follow-up task assignment
- Compliance documentation

### Feedback workflows

When feedback videos are shared, Tallyfy handles:
- Response deadline enforcement
- Action item extraction and assignment
- Revision tracking and approval
- Completion confirmation

## Connect today

<Aside type="note" title="Integration status">
Native Loom integration is planned. Loom currently offers an SDK for embedding recording capabilities rather than an open API.
</Aside>

**Middleware**: Connect via [Zapier](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/zapier/) or [Make](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/make/) to trigger workflows when Loom videos are recorded.

**Link detection**: Set up Slack or email integrations to detect Loom URLs and trigger the right workflows.

**API**: Build a custom integration using [Tallyfy's API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) with the Loom SDK for embedded recording.
