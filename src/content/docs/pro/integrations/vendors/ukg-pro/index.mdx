## The gap UKG Pro can't fill

UKG Pro handles workforce management, scheduling, and HR for large enterprises. But its multi-database architecture means integration projects can drag on for months, support response times stretch, and cross-department coordination stays manual.

Employee changes need handoffs between HR, IT, Finance, and Operations - and UKG Pro simply isn't built for that. Data lives in multiple internal stores, creating consistency headaches and extra steps for routine processes.

**What UKG Pro manages:**

- Workforce scheduling and labor management
- HR administration and employee records
- Time and attendance tracking
- Leave management and accruals

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Integration timelines stretching many months
- Support bottlenecks causing weeks of delays
- Data reconciliation across multiple internal databases
- Cross-department workflow coordination
- Reporting that requires heavy configuration
- Self-service workflows for common HR requests

UKG Pro covers enterprise workforce management well. Process coordination? That needs something faster and more flexible. Tallyfy provides the workflow layer that bridges UKG data with cross-team execution.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

Tallyfy sits between UKG Pro and your cross-department processes - giving you speed and visibility that UKG's architecture can't deliver on its own.

### Faster integrations

Instead of waiting months for UKG integrations:
- Connect via middleware while native integration develops
- Validate data before it flows to downstream systems
- Track handoffs with clear ownership and deadlines
- Route exceptions to the right people automatically

### Self-service workflows

Create workflows that don't require months of UKG configuration:
- Report request workflows with automatic distribution
- HR request routing without support tickets
- Succession planning with flexible customization
- Benefits verification and reconciliation
