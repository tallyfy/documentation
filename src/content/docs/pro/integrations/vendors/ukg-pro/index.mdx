## Quick Summary

We're integrating with UKG Pro to transform workforce management data into automated workflows that handle everything from complex scheduling to compliance tracking. When time punches are submitted, schedules change, or employees request leave in UKG, Tallyfy automatically orchestrates all the downstream processes - approvals, notifications, coverage arrangements, and payroll adjustments.

<Aside type="tip" title="Developer-Friendly Platform">
UKG provides comprehensive REST APIs through their Developer Hub with both HCM and Workforce Management capabilities. Merge recently partnered with UKG to simplify integration access.
</Aside>

## Why This Integration Matters

UKG Pro excels at workforce management and HCM, but your employee processes extend far beyond time tracking. Every schedule change affects operations, every leave request needs coverage, every overtime hour requires approval. 

Today, your managers juggle these workflows through emails, spreadsheets, and manual follow-ups. Tomorrow, UKG events will automatically trigger intelligent workflows that ensure proper coverage, compliance, and cost control.

## What We're Building

### Intelligent Scheduling Workflows

Transform workforce management into smooth operations:

- **Shift Swap Orchestration**: Automate approval chains when employees request schedule changes
- **Overtime Management**: Route overtime requests through proper approvals based on budgets and policies
- **Call-Off Coverage**: Instantly trigger replacement workflows when employees call in sick
- **Schedule Optimization**: Launch workflows to fill gaps based on skills, certifications, and availability

### Time and Attendance Automation

Connect time data to business processes:

- **Exception Management**: Flag and route attendance anomalies for manager review
- **Timecard Approvals**: Multi-level approval workflows based on hours, projects, or departments
- **Meal Break Compliance**: Track and enforce break requirements by state and role
- **Project Time Allocation**: Route time to proper cost centers with approval workflows

### Leave Management Excellence

Orchestrate complex leave processes:

- **FMLA Administration**: Complete workflows from initial request to return-to-work
- **PTO Approvals**: Intelligent routing based on coverage requirements and blackout dates
- **Leave of Absence**: Coordinate benefits, system access, and communication workflows
- **Disability Management**: Integrate short-term and long-term disability processes

## How to Connect Today

### Option 1: UKG REST API Integration

Direct integration using UKG Developer Hub APIs:

```javascript
// Example: Create coverage workflow when employee calls off
const handleCallOff = async (callOffData) => {
  // Get shift details from UKG
  const shift = await ukgAPI.getShift(callOffData.shiftId);
  const employee = await ukgAPI.getEmployee(callOffData.employeeId);
  
  // Find qualified replacements
  const availableEmployees = await ukgAPI.getAvailableEmployees({
    date: shift.date,
    skills: employee.skills,
    location: shift.location
  });
  
  // Create coverage workflow in Tallyfy
  const workflow = await fetch('https://api.tallyfy.com/v1/workflows', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TALLYFY_KEY',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      template_id: 'shift_coverage',
      priority: 'high',
      data: {
        shift_date: shift.date,
        shift_time: shift.startTime,
        department: shift.department,
        position: employee.position,
        skills_required: employee.skills,
        available_coverage: availableEmployees,
        original_employee: employee.name,
        reason: callOffData.reason
      }
    })
  });
  
  return workflow.json();
};
```

### Option 2: Partner Integration Platforms

Leverage UKG-certified partners:

- **Merge API**: New partnership provides unified access to UKG Pro and Ready
- **CloudApper**: UKG partner with custom integration solutions
- **Align HCM**: Certified UKG implementation partner
- **API integration platforms**: Workato, MuleSoft, Boomi

### Option 3: UKG Web Services

Use SOAP-based web services for specific needs:

```xml
<!-- Example: Time-off request workflow trigger -->
<soap:Envelope>
  <soap:Body>
    <GetTimeOffRequests>
      <Status>Pending</Status>
      <DateRange>
        <StartDate>2024-01-01</StartDate>
        <EndDate>2024-12-31</EndDate>
      </DateRange>
    </GetTimeOffRequests>
  </soap:Body>
</soap:Envelope>
```

### Option 4: Data Import/Export Tools

For organizations without API access:

- **Business Rules Import Tool**: Import workflow triggers
- **Data Import Service**: Bulk data synchronization
- **Custom Object APIs**: Extend UKG with workflow data
