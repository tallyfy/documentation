## The gap UKG Pro cannot fill

UKG Pro provides deep workforce management, scheduling, and HR capabilities for large enterprises. But UKG's multi-database architecture means integration projects can take many months, support response times can stretch significantly, and cross-department coordination requires manual intervention.

UKG Pro stores workforce data but cannot easily coordinate the handoffs between HR, IT, Finance, and Operations that employee changes require. Data lives in multiple internal stores, creating consistency challenges and extra steps for simple processes.

**What UKG Pro manages:**

- Workforce scheduling and labor management
- HR administration and employee records
- Time and attendance tracking
- Leave management and accruals

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Integration timelines stretching many months
- Support bottlenecks causing weeks of delays
- Data reconciliation across multiple internal databases
- Cross-department workflow coordination
- Reporting that requires extensive configuration
- Self-service workflows for common HR requests

UKG Pro serves enterprise workforce management. But process coordination requires faster, more flexible orchestration. Tallyfy provides the workflow layer that bridges UKG data with cross-team execution.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

Tallyfy acts as the orchestration layer between UKG Pro and your cross-department processes, providing speed and visibility that UKG's architecture cannot deliver alone.

### Accelerated integrations

Instead of waiting months for UKG integrations:
- Connect via middleware while native integration develops
- Validate data before it flows to downstream systems
- Track handoffs with clear ownership and deadlines
- Route exceptions to the right people automatically

### Self-service workflows

Create workflows that don't require months of UKG configuration:
- Report request workflows with automatic distribution
- HR request routing without support tickets
- Succession planning with flexible customization
- Benefits verification and reconciliation
