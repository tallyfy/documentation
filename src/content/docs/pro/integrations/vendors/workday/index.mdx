## The gap Workday can't fill

Workday centralizes HR and financial data for large enterprises. But the moment someone gets hired, a cascade of coordination begins - and Workday doesn't handle it.

Workday can't tell IT to order a laptop. It can't tell Facilities to assign a desk. It won't schedule orientation with Training or notify Finance to create an expense account. These handoffs end up in emails, spreadsheets, and chat threads - untracked and invisible.

**What Workday manages:**

- Employee records and org structure
- Payroll and compensation data
- Benefits administration and time tracking
- Financial transactions and reporting

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Cross-department coordination for onboarding and offboarding
- Multi-team approval chains spanning HR, IT, Finance, and Legal
- Real-time visibility into process completion across teams
- Conditional routing based on role, location, or department
- Structured handoffs with clear ownership and deadlines

Workday serves your HR and Finance teams. Employee lifecycle processes span every department. Tallyfy coordinates workflows across ALL your teams - not just one.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

When a Workday employee event fires - hire, termination, role change - Tallyfy launches a structured workflow that coordinates every downstream action. Every step has an owner, a deadline, and escalation rules if something stalls.

### Employee onboarding

When Workday records a new hire, Tallyfy kicks off:
- IT equipment provisioning and system access
- Facilities desk assignment and building access
- Training schedule and compliance certifications
- Finance expense account and corporate card setup
- Manager introductions and team integration

### Role changes and transfers

When Workday records a promotion or transfer, Tallyfy coordinates:
- Access permission updates across systems
- Equipment changes for new responsibilities
- Training requirements for the new role
- Announcement and knowledge transfer workflows

### Offboarding

When Workday records a termination, Tallyfy ensures:
- IT access revocation on the correct date
- Equipment return tracking
- Knowledge transfer completion
- Exit interview scheduling
- Final payroll coordination
