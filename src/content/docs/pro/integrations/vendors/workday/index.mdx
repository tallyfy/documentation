## Quick Summary

We're building enterprise integration with Workday to automatically transform your HCM and financial data into intelligent workflows. When employees join, change roles, or submit expenses in Workday, Tallyfy orchestrates every downstream process - from IT provisioning to budget approvals to compliance tracking - without manual intervention.

<Aside type="caution" title="Enterprise Platform">
Workday is an enterprise platform with complex integration requirements. Their new "Built on Workday" program launched in 2024, but access requires partnership approval. We can integrate today using Workday Integration Cloud or certified partners.

## Why This Integration Matters

Workday powers HR and finance for 60% of Fortune 500 companies, but it's just the system of record. The real work happens in hundreds of surrounding processes - onboarding checklists, approval chains, compliance workflows, and operational tasks.

Without integration, your teams spend hours copying data, chasing approvals, and coordinating handoffs. Our integration makes Workday events automatically trigger the right workflows, ensuring nothing falls through cracks while your team focuses on strategic work.

## What We're Building

### Enterprise Onboarding Orchestration

Transform complex enterprise hiring into smooth operations:

- **Requisition-to-Ready**: From job req approval in Workday to day-one readiness, orchestrate every step
- **Global Onboarding**: Handle country-specific requirements, visa workflows, and relocation processes
- **Security Clearance**: Coordinate background checks, drug screens, and credential verification
- **Cross-Functional Coordination**: IT, Facilities, Finance, and Legal workflows triggered automatically

### Financial Process Automation

Connect Workday Financials to operational workflows:

- **Expense Management**: Route expense reports through approval chains based on amount, type, and policy
- **Budget Approvals**: Trigger workflows when spending approaches thresholds
- **Vendor Onboarding**: Orchestrate vendor setup, compliance checks, and payment terms
- **Period Close**: Automate month-end tasks, reconciliations, and reporting

### Advanced HR Operations

Leverage Workday HCM for sophisticated workflows:

- **Reorganizations**: Mass update workflows for org changes
- **Performance Management**: Coordinate review cycles, calibrations, and compensation adjustments
- **Succession Planning**: Trigger development plans and readiness assessments
- **M&A Integration**: Onboard acquired employees with specialized workflows

## How to Connect Today

### Option 1: Workday Integration Cloud

Use Workday's native integration platform:

```xml
<!-- Example: Workday Studio Integration -->
<integration>
  <source>
    <workday-report id="New_Hires_Today"/>
  </source>
  <transformation>
    <map-to-tallyfy>
      <field source="Employee_ID" target="employee_id"/>

### Option 2: REST API Integration

const processWorkdayEvent = async (event) => {
  if (event.type === 'WORKER_HIRED') {
    const worker = await workdayAPI.getWorker(event.workerId);
    
    // Create comprehensive onboarding workflow
    const workflow = await fetch('https://api.tallyfy.com/v1/workflows', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TALLYFY_KEY',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        template_id: 'enterprise_onboarding',
        data: {
          // Worker details
          employee_id: worker.employeeID,
          name: worker.legalName,
          email: worker.workEmail,
          
          // Organization
          cost_center: worker.costCenter,
          business_unit: worker.businessUnit,
          location: worker.primaryWorkLocation,
          
          // Position
          job_profile: worker.jobProfile,
          job_family: worker.jobFamily,
          management_level: worker.managementLevel,
          
          // Manager chain
          manager: worker.manager,
          skip_level: worker.skipLevelManager,
          
          // Compliance
          worker_type: worker.workerType,
          regulatory_region: worker.regulatoryRegion
        }

    });
    
    return workflow.json();
