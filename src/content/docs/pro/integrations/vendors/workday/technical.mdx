## Integration options

Workday offers several integration methods. Pick the one that fits your technical needs and partnership status.

### Workday Integration Cloud (XML)

Use Workday's native integration platform for scheduled data sync:

```xml
<integration>
  <source>
    <workday-report id="New_Hires_Today"/>
  </source>
  <transformation>
    <map-to-tallyfy>
      <field source="Employee_ID" target="employee_id"/>
      <field source="Legal_Name" target="full_name"/>
      <field source="Job_Profile" target="position"/>
      <field source="Supervisory_Organization" target="department"/>
    </map-to-tallyfy>
  </transformation>
  <target>
    <tallyfy-api>
      <endpoint>https://go.tallyfy.com/api/organizations/{org_id}/runs</endpoint>
      <template>enterprise_onboarding</template>
    </tallyfy-api>
  </target>
</integration>
```

### REST API integration

For approved partners with Workday REST API access:

```javascript
const processWorkdayEvent = async (event) => {
  if (event.type === 'WORKER_HIRED') {
    const worker = await workdayAPI.getWorker(event.workerId);

    const response = await fetch(
      'https://go.tallyfy.com/api/organizations/{org_id}/runs',
      {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TALLYFY_TOKEN',
          'X-Tallyfy-Client': 'APIClient',
          'Accept': 'application/json',
          'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          checklist_id: 'enterprise_onboarding',
          prerun: {
            employee_id: worker.employeeID,
            name: worker.legalName,
            email: worker.workEmail,
            cost_center: worker.costCenter,
            location: worker.primaryWorkLocation,
            job_profile: worker.jobProfile,
            manager: worker.manager
          }
        })
      }
    );

    return response.json();
  }
};
```

## Data mapping

Common Workday fields to map to Tallyfy process variables:

| Workday Field | Tallyfy Variable | Description |
|---------------|------------------|-------------|
| `employeeID` | `employee_id` | Unique employee identifier |
| `legalName` | `full_name` | Employee full name |
| `workEmail` | `email` | Work email address |
| `costCenter` | `cost_center` | Cost center code |
| `businessUnit` | `business_unit` | Business unit name |
| `primaryWorkLocation` | `location` | Office location |
| `jobProfile` | `job_title` | Job title / role |
| `manager` | `manager_name` | Direct manager |
| `workerType` | `employee_type` | Full-time, contractor, etc. |

## Authentication

Workday uses OAuth 2.0 with JWT for API authentication. Store credentials securely - don't expose them in client-side code.

## iPaaS alternatives

If you don't have direct API access, use an integration platform instead:

- **Celigo** - NetSuite-native with Workday connectors
- **Workato** - Enterprise automation recipes
- **MuleSoft** - Anypoint Platform connectors
- **Boomi** - Dell Boomi AtomSphere
