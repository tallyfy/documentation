## Why Integrate with Insperity?

Insperity's full-service PEO model means they manage critical HR functions that often trigger business processes:

- **Employee Onboarding**: New hire paperwork and orientation
- **Benefits Enrollment**: Annual enrollment and life events
- **Compliance Management**: HR compliance and risk mitigation
- **Performance Management**: Reviews and career development
- **Payroll Processing**: Semi-monthly payroll and tax filing

## Integration Challenges

<Aside type="caution" title="Reality Check">
  Insperity operates primarily as a closed ecosystem with limited integration capabilities. Their focus on full-service HR outsourcing means they prefer to handle everything internally rather than integrate with external systems.
</Aside>

### Technical Limitations

1. **No Public API**: Insperity doesn't offer a publicly accessible API
2. **Limited Integration Points**: Few native integrations available
3. **Partner Requirements**: Must join partner program for access
4. **Data Export Restrictions**: Limited automated data export options

### Business Model Conflicts

- **PEO Model**: Co-employment structure complicates integrations
- **Service-First Approach**: Emphasis on human service over tech
- **Enterprise Focus**: Custom implementations for larger clients
- **Compliance Concerns**: Strict data security requirements

## Current Integration Options

### 1. Workday Partnership (2024)

Insperity partnered with Workday to provide a joint solution combining:
- Workday's enterprise HCM platform
- Insperity's PEO services
- Limited data exchange capabilities

<Aside type="note">
  This partnership is primarily for enterprise clients and doesn't provide general API access.
</Aside>

### 2. General Ledger Export

- **Format**: CSV or fixed-width files
- **Frequency**: Manual export after each payroll
- **Data**: Payroll journal entries only
- **Automation**: Limited to SFTP delivery

### 3. Standard Reports

- **Access**: Through Insperity Premier portal
- **Format**: PDF or Excel downloads
- **Scheduling**: Limited automated delivery
- **API Access**: Not available

## Recommended Workarounds

  <TabItem label="Data Sync Strategy">
    ### Manual Export + Import
    
    Since Insperity lacks APIs, implement a semi-automated process:
    
    <Steps>
      1. **Schedule Regular Exports**
         - Work with Insperity account manager
         - Set up recurring report delivery
         - Use SFTP for file transfer
      
      2. **Build Import Scripts**
         ```python
         # Example: Process Insperity payroll export
         import pandas as pd
         from tallyfy_api import create_process
         
         def process_payroll_export(file_path):
             df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
             for _, row in df.iterrows():
                 if row['pay_type'] == 'bonus':
                     create_process('bonus-approval', {
                         'employee_id': row['emp_id'],
                         'amount': row['amount']
                     })
         ```
      
      3. **Monitor File Drops**
         - Set up file watchers on SFTP
         - Trigger Tallyfy processes on new files
         - Send notifications for exceptions
    </Steps>
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem label="Portal Automation">
    ### Browser Automation Approach
    
    Use web scraping for critical data when APIs aren't available:
    
    ```python
    from playwright import sync_playwright
    import schedule
    import time
    
    def extract_insperity_data():
        with sync_playwright() as p:
            browser = p.chromium.launch()
            page = browser.new_page()
            
            # Login to Insperity Premier
            page.goto('https://portal.insperity.com')
            page.fill('#username', 'your_username')
            page.fill('#password', 'your_password')
            page.click('button[type="submit"]')
            
            # Navigate to reports section
            page.wait_for_selector('.reports-menu')
            page.click('.reports-menu')
            
            # Extract employee data
            employees = page.query_selector_all('.employee-row')
            for emp in employees:
                process_employee_data(emp)
            
            browser.close()
    
    # Schedule daily extraction
    schedule.every().day.at("09:00").do(extract_insperity_data)
    ```
    
    <Aside type="caution">
      Browser automation should be a last resort. Always check Insperity's terms of service and get written permission before implementing.

    ### Integration Platform Solutions
    
    Some iPaaS providers offer Insperity connectors:
    
    **Workato**
    - Pre-built Insperity connector (enterprise only)
    - Requires Insperity approval
    - Custom recipe development needed
    
    **Dell Boomi**
    - Limited Insperity support
    - Custom connector development required
    - File-based integration focus
    
    **Manual Middleware**
    ```javascript
    // Node.js middleware for file processing
    const chokidar = require('chokidar');
    const csv = require('csv-parser');
    const fs = require('fs');
    
    // Watch Insperity export directory
    const watcher = chokidar.watch('/sftp/insperity/*.csv', {
      ignored: /^\./,
      persistent: true
    });
    
    watcher.on('add', path => {
      fs.createReadStream(path)
        .pipe(csv())
        .on('data', (row) => {
          // Process each row and trigger Tallyfy
          processInsperityRecord(row);
        });
    });
    ```

## Best Practices

### Working with PEOs

1. **Understand the Relationship**
   - PEO is co-employer of record
   - They control data access
   - Integration requires their approval

2. **Focus on Key Touchpoints**
   - New hire onboarding
   - Termination processing
   - Benefits changes
   - Payroll exceptions

3. **Build Robust Error Handling**
   - Expect manual processes
   - Plan for delays
   - Create fallback procedures

### Data Security

<Aside type="tip" title="Security First">
  When handling Insperity data:
  - Encrypt all file transfers
  - Implement audit logging
  - Follow PCI compliance for payroll data
  - Regular security reviews with Insperity
</Aside>

## Conclusion

While Insperity doesn't offer modern API capabilities, integration is still possible through creative workarounds. The key is setting realistic expectations and building robust file-based integration patterns. For organizations requiring deeper integration, consider evaluating alternative HR platforms with better API support.

<Aside type="note" title="Future Outlook">
  Insperity's 2024 Workday partnership suggests they're recognizing the need for better integration capabilities. However, meaningful API access for general developers remains unlikely in the near term.
