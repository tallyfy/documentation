## The gap Insperity can't fill

Insperity provides full-service PEO with HR outsourcing for SMBs - but it's focused on HR administration, not coordinating the business processes that employee events trigger across your organization.

When Insperity processes a new hire, they handle paperwork and benefits enrollment. But IT needs to create accounts. Facilities needs workspace setup. Training needs to schedule orientation. None of that is Insperity's job.

**What Insperity manages:**

- Full-service PEO with co-employment
- Payroll processing and tax filing
- Benefits administration and compliance
- HR consulting and risk management

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Cross-department coordination beyond HR
- IT provisioning and system access setup
- Equipment ordering and delivery tracking
- Multi-team approval workflows
- Real-time visibility into process completion

Insperity handles HR outsourcing. Business processes span every department. Tallyfy coordinates workflows across all your teams - not just one.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

When an Insperity employee event occurs - hire, termination, status change - Tallyfy launches a workflow that coordinates all downstream teams outside the PEO relationship.

### Employee onboarding

When Insperity records a new hire, Tallyfy kicks off:
- IT account and equipment provisioning
- Facilities workspace and access setup
- Training enrollment and tracking
- Finance expense account configuration
- Manager welcome workflows

### Offboarding coordination

When Insperity processes a termination, Tallyfy ensures:
- IT access revocation with proper timing
- Equipment return tracking
- Knowledge transfer completion
- Exit process documentation
