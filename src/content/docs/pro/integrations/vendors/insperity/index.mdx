## The gap Insperity cannot fill

Insperity provides full-service PEO with comprehensive HR outsourcing for SMBs. But Insperity's closed ecosystem focuses on HR administration, not coordinating the business processes that employee events trigger across your organization.

When Insperity processes a new hire, they handle employment paperwork and benefits enrollment. But IT needs to create accounts. Facilities needs workspace setup. Training needs to schedule orientation. These cross-department processes require coordination beyond what a PEO provides.

**What Insperity manages:**

- Full-service PEO with co-employment
- Payroll processing and tax filing
- Benefits administration and compliance
- HR consulting and risk management

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Cross-department coordination beyond HR
- IT provisioning and system access setup
- Equipment ordering and delivery tracking
- Multi-stakeholder approval workflows
- Real-time visibility into process completion

Insperity handles your HR outsourcing. But business processes span every department. Tallyfy orchestrates workflows across ALL your teams - not just one.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

When an Insperity employee event occurs - hire, termination, status change - Tallyfy launches a structured workflow that coordinates all downstream teams outside the PEO relationship.

### Employee onboarding

When Insperity records a new hire, Tallyfy orchestrates:
- IT account and equipment provisioning
- Facilities workspace and access setup
- Training enrollment and tracking
- Finance expense account configuration
- Manager welcome workflows

### Offboarding coordination

When Insperity processes a termination, Tallyfy ensures:
- IT access revocation with proper timing
- Equipment return tracking
- Knowledge transfer completion
- Exit process documentation
