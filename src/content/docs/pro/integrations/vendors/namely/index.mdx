## Where Namely stops and manual work begins

Namely covers mid-market HR well - HRIS, payroll, benefits, and talent management. But when an HR event needs action from multiple departments, you're back to emails and spreadsheets.

A new hire in Namely triggers paperwork. IT still needs to set up accounts. Facilities needs to prepare a workspace. Training needs to book orientation. None of that coordination lives inside Namely.

**What Namely handles:**

- Employee records and HRIS
- Payroll and benefits
- Talent management and reviews
- Time-off tracking

**What it doesn't:**

- Cross-department coordination
- IT provisioning and access management
- Equipment ordering and tracking
- Multi-team approval chains
- Vendor and contractor workflows

Namely covers HR. Tallyfy coordinates the workflows that touch every other team.

## How Tallyfy picks up the slack

When a Namely event fires - hire, role change, departure - Tallyfy kicks off a structured workflow that reaches every team involved.

### Employee onboarding

When Namely records a new hire, Tallyfy runs:
- IT account setup and equipment provisioning
- Facilities workspace and building access
- Training schedule and compliance tracking
- Finance expense account configuration
- Team introduction workflows

### Role change coordination

When Namely records a promotion or transfer, Tallyfy handles:
- Access permission updates across systems
- Equipment changes if needed
- Training for new responsibilities
- Announcement and notification workflows
