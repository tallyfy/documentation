## The gap Namely cannot fill

Namely provides all-in-one HR for mid-market companies - HRIS, payroll, benefits, and talent management. But the moment HR events trigger cross-department coordination, manual intervention is required.

When Namely records a new hire, the HR system handles paperwork. But IT needs to provision accounts and equipment. Facilities needs workspace preparation. Training needs to schedule orientation. These cross-department processes require coordination beyond what Namely provides.

**What Namely manages:**

- HRIS and employee records
- Payroll and benefits administration
- Talent management and reviews
- Time-off tracking and approvals

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Cross-department process coordination
- IT provisioning and access management
- Equipment ordering and tracking
- Multi-stakeholder approval chains
- External vendor and contractor workflows

Namely serves your mid-market HR needs. But employee processes span every department. Tallyfy orchestrates workflows across ALL your teams - not just one.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

When a Namely employee event fires - hire, role change, time-off request, departure - Tallyfy launches a structured workflow that coordinates every downstream team.

### Employee onboarding

When Namely records a new hire, Tallyfy orchestrates:
- IT account setup and equipment provisioning
- Facilities workspace and building access
- Training schedule and compliance tracking
- Finance expense account configuration
- Team introduction workflows

### Role change coordination

When Namely records a promotion or transfer, Tallyfy handles:
- Access permission updates across systems
- Equipment changes if needed
- Training for new responsibilities
- Announcement and notification workflows
