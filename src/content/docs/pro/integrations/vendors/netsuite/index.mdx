## Quick Summary

We're integrating with NetSuite SuitePeople to transform your unified business data into automated workflows that span HR, finance, and operations. When employees are hired, expenses submitted, or projects launched in NetSuite, Tallyfy orchestrates every downstream process - from approvals to provisioning to compliance - all while maintaining NetSuite as your single source of truth.

<Aside type="tip" title="REST API Now Preferred">
NetSuite 2024.1 release emphasizes REST APIs as the preferred integration method, with improved performance and OpenAPI 3.0 support, making integration faster and more reliable than ever.
</Aside>

## Why This Integration Matters

NetSuite SuitePeople provides a unified platform for HR within your ERP, but business processes extend far beyond data management. Every hire needs equipment, training, and system access. Every expense needs multi-tier approvals. Every project needs resource allocation and task coordination.

Without integration, teams manually bridge NetSuite with operational workflows. Our integration makes NetSuite events automatically trigger intelligent workflows that ensure consistent execution across your entire organization.

## What We're Building

### Enterprise HR Orchestration

Transform SuitePeople data into comprehensive workflows:

- **Global Onboarding**: Pull employee, role, and subsidiary data to orchestrate location-specific onboarding
- **Compensation Management**: Route salary changes, bonuses, and equity through complex approval matrices
- **Performance Workflows**: Trigger review cycles, calibrations, and succession planning
- **Workforce Planning**: Automate requisition approvals and headcount management

### Financial Process Automation

Connect NetSuite financials to operational workflows:

- **Expense Management**: Intelligent routing based on amount, type, GL coding, and policy
- **Purchase Approvals**: Multi-tier workflows for POs based on vendor, amount, and budget
- **Project Workflows**: Resource allocation, milestone tracking, and billing automation
- **Period Close**: Orchestrate month-end tasks across departments

### Cross-Module Integration

Leverage NetSuite's unified data model:

- **Customer Onboarding**: Sales win triggers implementation workflows
- **Vendor Management**: Procurement triggers compliance and setup workflows
- **Inventory Processes**: Stock levels trigger purchasing and allocation workflows
- **Revenue Recognition**: Contract changes trigger accounting workflows

## How to Connect Today

### Option 1: NetSuite REST API (Recommended 2024)

Use the modern REST API with OAuth 2.0:

```javascript
// Example: Create workflow when employee hired in SuitePeople
const handleEmployeeHire = async (employeeData) => {
  // Get complete employee record from NetSuite
  const employee = await netsuiteAPI.get(`/employee/${employeeData.id}`, {
    expand: ['department', 'location', 'subsidiary', 'supervisor']
  });
  
  // Get custom fields for role-specific workflows
  const customFields = await netsuiteAPI.get(`/employee/${employeeData.id}/customfields`);
  
  // Create comprehensive onboarding workflow
  const workflow = await fetch('https://api.tallyfy.com/v1/workflows', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TALLYFY_KEY',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      template_id: 'netsuite_enterprise_onboarding',
      name: `Onboarding - ${employee.entityId} - ${employee.firstName} ${employee.lastName}`,
      data: {
        // Core employee data
        employee_id: employee.id,
        entity_id: employee.entityId,
        full_name: `${employee.firstName} ${employee.lastName}`,
        email: employee.email,
        
        // Organization structure
        subsidiary: employee.subsidiary.name,
        department: employee.department.name,
        location: employee.location.name,
        supervisor: employee.supervisor.name,
        
        // Role and compensation
        job_title: employee.title,
        employee_type: employee.employeeType,
        pay_frequency: employee.payFrequency,
        
        // NetSuite-specific
        class: employee.class,
        cost_center: customFields.custentity_cost_center,
        project_codes: customFields.custentity_project_codes,
        
        // Compliance
        work_authorization: employee.isJobExempt,
        labor_cost: employee.laborCost
      }
    })
  });
  
  return workflow.json();
};
```

### Option 2: SuiteScript Integration

Build native NetSuite scripts:

```javascript
/**
 * @NApiVersion 2.1
 * @NScriptType UserEventScript
 */
define(['N/https', 'N/record'], function(https, record) {
  function afterSubmit(context) {
    if (context.type === context.UserEventType.CREATE) {
      const employee = context.newRecord;
      
      // Send to Tallyfy
      https.post({
        url: 'https://api.tallyfy.com/v1/workflows',
        headers: {
          'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_KEY',
          'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          template_id: 'employee_onboarding',
          data: {
            employee_id: employee.id,
            name: employee.getValue('entityid')
          }
        })
      });
    }
  }
  
  return { afterSubmit: afterSubmit };
});
```

### Option 3: SuiteTalk SOAP API

For legacy integrations:

```xml
<!-- Get employee data via SOAP -->
<soap:Body>
  <platformMsgs:get>
    <platformMsgs:baseRef xsi:type="platformCore:RecordRef" 
                         type="employee" 
                         internalId="12345"/>
  </platformMsgs:get>
</soap:Body>
```

### Option 4: iPaaS Platforms

Use integration platforms:

- **Celigo**: NetSuite-native integration platform
- **Workato**: Enterprise automation with NetSuite recipes
- **Boomi**: Dell Boomi AtomSphere with NetSuite connectors
- **MuleSoft**: Anypoint Platform with NetSuite support
