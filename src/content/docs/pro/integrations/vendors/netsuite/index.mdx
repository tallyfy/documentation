## The gap NetSuite can't fill

NetSuite is your financial system of record - but its workflows operate on single records. It can't coordinate an invoice approval that spans Accounts Payable, a department manager, and the CFO in sequence. Each approval has to be a separate workflow.

NetSuite records transactions. It doesn't handle the human decisions around them. Who reviews the expense? Who approves the PO? Who verifies vendor compliance before the first payment? That coordination happens outside NetSuite - in email threads, spreadsheets, and meetings.

**What NetSuite manages:**

- Financial transactions and GL entries
- Employee records via SuitePeople
- Inventory and order management
- Multi-subsidiary consolidation

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Approval chains that span multiple departments
- Month-end close coordination across Accounting, Operations, and Compliance
- Vendor onboarding with legal review, risk assessment, and payment setup
- Exception handling when invoices don't match POs
- Cross-department budget approval workflows

NetSuite serves your Finance team. But financial processes need coordination across Sales, Operations, Legal, and Compliance. Tallyfy runs workflows across all your teams - not just one.

## How Tallyfy fills this gap

When a NetSuite event fires - new employee, expense submitted, PO created - Tallyfy launches a structured workflow that coordinates everyone involved. Every approval gets an owner, a deadline, and escalation if someone doesn't respond.

### Invoice approvals

When NetSuite receives an invoice, Tallyfy handles:
- Three-way match validation (PO, receipt, invoice)
- Department manager approval for their cost center
- Finance review for GL coding and policy compliance
- CFO approval for amounts above threshold
- Exception routing when matches fail

### Month-end close

When period close begins, Tallyfy coordinates:
- Reconciliation task assignment across teams
- Journal entry review and approval chain
- Accrual posting verification
- Consolidation checklist completion
- Compliance sign-off before close

### Vendor onboarding

When Procurement requests a new vendor, Tallyfy manages:
- Risk assessment and compliance verification
- Legal contract review and approval
- Tax documentation collection (W-9, etc.)
- Banking information validation
- NetSuite master data creation approval
