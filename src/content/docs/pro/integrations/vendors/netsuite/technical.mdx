## Integration options

NetSuite's REST APIs are the preferred integration method. Pick the approach that fits your team's technical setup.

### REST API integration (recommended)

Use OAuth 2.0 with NetSuite's REST API to fetch record data, then launch a Tallyfy process[^1] via the Tallyfy API. Note that Tallyfy's API uses org-scoped endpoints - templates are called "checklists" in API paths, and launching a process means creating a "run."

```javascript
const handleEmployeeHire = async (employeeData, orgId, checklistId) => {
  // 1. Fetch employee details from NetSuite
  const employee = await netsuiteAPI.get(`/employee/${employeeData.id}`, {
    expand: ['department', 'location', 'subsidiary', 'supervisor']
  });

  // 2. Launch a Tallyfy process (run) from a template (checklist)
  const run = await fetch(
    `https://go.tallyfy.com/api/organizations/${orgId}/checklists/${checklistId}/runs`,
    {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TALLYFY_TOKEN',
        'X-Tallyfy-Client': 'APIClient',
        'Accept': 'application/json',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        name: `Onboarding - ${employee.entityId}`,
        prerun: {
          employee_id: employee.id,
          full_name: `${employee.firstName} ${employee.lastName}`,
          email: employee.email,
          subsidiary: employee.subsidiary.name,
          department: employee.department.name,
          location: employee.location.name,
          supervisor: employee.supervisor.name
        }
      })
    }
  );

  return run.json();
};
```

### SuiteScript integration

You can also build native NetSuite scripts that fire on record events. This SuiteScript example launches a Tallyfy process whenever a new employee record is created:

```javascript
/**
 * @NApiVersion 2.1
 * @NScriptType UserEventScript
 */
define(['N/https', 'N/record'], function(https, record) {
  function afterSubmit(context) {
    if (context.type === context.UserEventType.CREATE) {
      const employee = context.newRecord;
      const orgId = 'YOUR_ORG_ID';
      const checklistId = 'YOUR_CHECKLIST_ID';

      https.post({
        url: `https://go.tallyfy.com/api/organizations/${orgId}/checklists/${checklistId}/runs`,
        headers: {
          'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TALLYFY_TOKEN',
          'X-Tallyfy-Client': 'APIClient',
          'Accept': 'application/json',
          'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          name: `Onboarding - ${employee.getValue('entityid')}`,
          prerun: {
            employee_id: employee.id,
            name: employee.getValue('entityid')
          }
        })
      });
    }
  }

  return { afterSubmit: afterSubmit };
});
```

## Data mapping

Common NetSuite fields you'll want to map to Tallyfy kick-off form fields:

| NetSuite field | Tallyfy form field | Description |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| `id` | `employee_id` | Internal record ID |
| `entityId` | `entity_id` | Employee number |
| `firstName` + `lastName` | `full_name` | Employee name |
| `email` | `email` | Email address |
| `subsidiary.name` | `subsidiary` | Legal entity |
| `department.name` | `department` | Department name |
| `location.name` | `location` | Office location |
| `supervisor.name` | `manager` | Direct manager |
| `title` | `job_title` | Job title |
| `employeeType` | `employee_type` | Employment type |

## iPaaS alternatives

If SuiteScript development isn't an option, consider these platforms:

- **Celigo** - NetSuite-native integration platform
- **Workato** - Enterprise automation with NetSuite recipes
- **Boomi** - Dell Boomi AtomSphere with NetSuite connectors
- **MuleSoft** - Anypoint Platform with NetSuite support

[^1]: In Tallyfy's API, templates are called "checklists" and running instances are called "runs"
