## Integration options

NetSuite emphasizes REST APIs as the preferred integration method. Choose based on your technical requirements.

### REST API integration (recommended)

Use OAuth 2.0 authentication with NetSuite's REST API:

```javascript
const handleEmployeeHire = async (employeeData) => {
  const employee = await netsuiteAPI.get(`/employee/${employeeData.id}`, {
    expand: ['department', 'location', 'subsidiary', 'supervisor']
  });

  const workflow = await fetch('https://api.tallyfy.com/v1/workflows', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_TALLYFY_KEY',
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      template_id: 'netsuite_onboarding',
      name: `Onboarding - ${employee.entityId}`,
      data: {
        employee_id: employee.id,
        full_name: `${employee.firstName} ${employee.lastName}`,
        email: employee.email,
        subsidiary: employee.subsidiary.name,
        department: employee.department.name,
        location: employee.location.name,
        supervisor: employee.supervisor.name
      }
    })
  });

  return workflow.json();
};
```

### SuiteScript integration

Build native NetSuite scripts that trigger on record events:

```javascript
/**
 * @NApiVersion 2.1
 * @NScriptType UserEventScript
 */
define(['N/https', 'N/record'], function(https, record) {
  function afterSubmit(context) {
    if (context.type === context.UserEventType.CREATE) {
      const employee = context.newRecord;

      https.post({
        url: 'https://api.tallyfy.com/v1/workflows',
        headers: {
          'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_KEY',
          'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          template_id: 'employee_onboarding',
          data: {
            employee_id: employee.id,
            name: employee.getValue('entityid')
          }
        })
      });
    }
  }

  return { afterSubmit: afterSubmit };
});
```

## Data mapping

Common NetSuite fields to map to Tallyfy workflow variables:

| NetSuite Field | Tallyfy Variable | Description |
|----------------|------------------|-------------|
| `id` | `employee_id` | Internal record ID |
| `entityId` | `entity_id` | Employee number |
| `firstName` + `lastName` | `full_name` | Employee name |
| `email` | `email` | Email address |
| `subsidiary.name` | `subsidiary` | Legal entity |
| `department.name` | `department` | Department name |
| `location.name` | `location` | Office location |
| `supervisor.name` | `manager` | Direct manager |
| `title` | `job_title` | Job title |
| `employeeType` | `employee_type` | Employment type |

## iPaaS alternatives

If SuiteScript development is not available:

- **Celigo**: NetSuite-native integration platform
- **Workato**: Enterprise automation with NetSuite recipes
- **Boomi**: Dell Boomi AtomSphere with NetSuite connectors
- **MuleSoft**: Anypoint Platform with NetSuite support
