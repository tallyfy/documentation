## The gap Slack cannot fill

Slack is where your team communicates. But communication is not process.

When someone asks "can you approve this?" in a Slack message, there's no owner, no deadline, no escalation. If the message gets buried in a busy channel, the work doesn't happen. Slack has no way to track whether a request was completed or who is responsible for it.

**What Slack handles:**

- Real-time team messaging
- Channel-based conversations
- File sharing and search
- Video calls and huddles

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Request tracking with clear ownership and deadlines
- Approval workflows with accountability and audit trails
- SLA enforcement and automatic escalation
- Process visibility across the organization
- Completion tracking and performance metrics

Slack is where teams talk. Tallyfy is where work gets tracked and completed. The integration bridges conversation to action.
