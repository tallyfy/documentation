## The gap Slack can't fill

Slack is where your team communicates. But communication isn't process.

When someone asks "can you approve this?" in Slack, there's no owner, no deadline, no escalation. If the message gets buried in a busy channel, the work doesn't happen. Slack can't track whether a request was completed or who's responsible.

**What Slack handles:**

- Real-time messaging
- Channel-based conversations
- File sharing and search
- Video calls and huddles

**What falls through the cracks:**

- Request tracking with ownership and deadlines
- Approval workflows with audit trails
- SLA enforcement and automatic escalation
- Process visibility across the organization
- Completion tracking and performance metrics

Slack is where teams talk. Tallyfy is where work gets tracked. The integration bridges conversation to action.
