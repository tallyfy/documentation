## Connecting Tallyfy to your CRM or ERP system

You can connect Tallyfy to your Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system (like Salesforce or SFDC, HubSpot, Microsoft Dynamics 365, etc.) or Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system such as Netsuite, SAP, etc. This connection lets you link your sales or operational processes managed in the CRM/ERP with detailed workflows that run in Tallyfy.

### Why connect Tallyfy to your CRM/ERP?

- **Save on licenses**: Run detailed operational workflows in Tallyfy without buying expensive CRM/ERP licenses for everyone who needs to be involved.
- **Consistent processes**: Ensure standard procedures (like client onboarding or support) are followed - even when you're involving teams outside the CRM/ERP.
- **Smooth handoffs**: Make transitions between teams (like Sales to Operations) trackable and seamless.
- **Better client experience**: Give clients a consistent journey from first contact through delivery.

### The critical gap between CRM stages (and how Tallyfy fills it)

CRMs track your deals through stages - Lead, Qualified, Proposal, Negotiation, Closed Won. But here's what they miss: the dozens of micro-tasks that must happen between each stage transition. These invisible tasks determine whether deals progress or stall.

Think about what really happens when a deal moves from "Qualified" to "Proposal" stage. It's not one click - it's a cascade of coordinated activities: technical reviews, pricing approvals, legal checks, resource allocation, competitor analysis, and custom demo preparation. Each involves multiple people, specific deadlines, and conditional logic based on deal characteristics.

Tallyfy makes these micro-tasks visible, trackable, and automatic. While your CRM shows the big picture, Tallyfy ensures every critical step between stages gets done right.

### What CRMs cannot do (but Tallyfy works perfectly for)

CRMs excel at storing customer data and tracking sales activities. But they fall short when you need to manage complex operational workflows. Here's where businesses hit roadblocks with CRM-only approaches:

#### Inflexible task sequences
CRMs force you into rigid, linear task flows that can't handle real business complexity. Does your client onboarding need different steps based on deal size, location, or service type? You're stuck with manual workarounds or duplicate processes.

Tallyfy's [conditional automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/conditionals/) automatically show or hide steps based on form answers. Personalized workflows without the headache.

#### Missing accountability and notifications
Most CRMs require people to log in daily and manually check for pending tasks. No automatic assignment of next steps. No deadline management across complex multi-step processes. It's exhausting.

Tallyfy automatically assigns tasks to the right people at the right time, sends deadline reminders, and escalates overdue items - workflows move forward without manual oversight.

#### Fragmented cross-team collaboration  
CRMs work well for sales teams but what happens when processes involve people outside the system? Legal, Finance, external partners - information gets trapped in silos. Missed handoffs. Inconsistent execution.

Tallyfy lets you involve anyone - internal [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) or external [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) - in the same workflow. Everyone sees their specific tasks and deadlines.

#### Weak audit trails and compliance
CRMs track data changes but don't keep detailed records of who did what task, when, and in what order. For regulated industries or quality processes, this creates massive compliance gaps.

Every Tallyfy [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) automatically creates a complete audit trail. You see exactly what happened, when, and by whom - perfect for compliance reporting or process improvement.

#### Disconnected tool ecosystem
CRMs integrate with some tools, sure. But they can't coordinate complex workflows that span multiple systems. You end up with manual data entry between your CRM, project management tools, document systems, and communication platforms. Hours wasted.

Tallyfy sits above these tools, connecting them through [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) to create seamless end-to-end processes. Each tool does what it does best.

### Real examples of micro-tasks between CRM stages

#### Lead → Marketing Qualified Lead (MQL)
Your CRM shows a lead. But converting it to MQL requires micro-tasks that CRMs can't track:
- Research company size and industry fit (assigned to SDR)
- Verify email and phone accuracy (marketing ops task)
- Check for existing customer conflicts (account management review)
- Score based on engagement metrics (automated calculation)
- Enrich data from third-party sources (operations task)

Tallyfy launches this 5-task workflow automatically when a new lead enters your CRM. Each task has its owner, deadline, and completion criteria. The lead only advances to MQL when all micro-tasks complete successfully.

#### MQL → Sales Qualified Lead (SQL)
Moving from marketing-qualified to sales-qualified isn't just changing a dropdown. It triggers:
- Schedule discovery call (SDR task with calendar integration)
- Prepare industry-specific talking points (sales enablement creates)
- Identify decision makers via LinkedIn (research task)
- Check credit and payment history (finance verification)
- Create personalized demo environment (solutions engineering prep)

Without Tallyfy, these tasks happen inconsistently - or not at all. Sales reps waste time in meetings they're unprepared for.

#### SQL → Opportunity
Creating an opportunity triggers a complex orchestration:
- Define solution requirements (solutions architect, 2-day deadline)
- Estimate implementation timeline (delivery team input required)
- Calculate pricing with discounts (needs manager approval if >20%)
- Assess competitive landscape (marketing provides battlecards)
- Identify risks and dependencies (cross-functional review)

Tallyfy's conditional logic adjusts this workflow based on deal size. Enterprise deals add security reviews and legal pre-approval steps automatically.

#### Opportunity → Closed Won
The most critical transition needs flawless execution:
- Generate MSA and SOW (legal, varies by jurisdiction)
- Obtain final pricing approval (CFO for deals >$100k)
- Coordinate signature process (DocuSign integration)
- Create implementation project (auto-generates from template)
- Schedule kickoff call (CSM with available resources)
- Provision accounts and access (IT and security tasks)
- Send welcome package (marketing automation trigger)

Each micro-task must complete in sequence, with the right person, at the right time. CRMs can't orchestrate this complexity - they just show "Closed Won" while chaos happens behind the scenes.

### Common connection examples

#### Lead management
- New lead appears in your CRM? Automatically kick off a lead qualification process in Tallyfy.
- Assign tasks in Tallyfy for researching or contacting the lead.
- Send updated lead information back to the CRM record.

#### Sales stage changes
- Deal moves to a new stage in your CRM (like "Proposal Sent")? The relevant Tallyfy process starts automatically (like "Contract Review").
- Include people who don't use the CRM (like Legal or Finance) in necessary steps.

#### Client onboarding
- Deal marked "Won" in the CRM? The detailed client onboarding process launches in Tallyfy instantly.
- Hand off tasks to the implementation or customer success team with zero friction.
- Even invite the client as a guest to participate in specific onboarding tasks.

#### Standardizing support
- Use Tallyfy to manage complex or multi-step customer support procedures.
- Ensure support agents follow consistent steps for specific types of issues - every single time.
- Train new support staff 3x faster using standard Tallyfy templates.

### Why micro-task visibility determines sales success

Sales leaders often wonder why similar opportunities have wildly different outcomes. The answer lies in the execution of micro-tasks between CRM stages. Two deals might both show "Proposal Stage" in your CRM, but their underlying realities differ completely:

**Deal A (without Tallyfy micro-task management):**
- Proposal sent without technical review (errors discovered later)
- Pricing approved verbally but not documented (confusion during negotiation)
- Implementation team not consulted (unrealistic timeline promised)
- Legal review skipped to "save time" (contract revisions delay close by weeks)

**Deal B (with Tallyfy orchestrating micro-tasks):**
- Technical review completed, dependencies identified
- Pricing approved in writing with all stakeholders aligned
- Implementation team confirmed resource availability
- Legal pre-approved standard terms, exceptions documented

Both deals look identical in the CRM. But Deal B closes 3x faster with fewer surprises because Tallyfy ensured every micro-task between stages was completed properly. This isn't about adding bureaucracy - it's about making the right things happen automatically.

### How to connect using middleware or links

Most connections are built using [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) platforms (Zapier, Make, Power Automate, etc.). Direct links work too.

:::note[Choosing Middleware]
As mentioned elsewhere, Zapier is fine for simple links. For more robust connections, consider Make.com or Power Automate. Developers can use the Tallyfy API for full control.

## Integration flow visualization

This diagram shows how data flows between your CRM/ERP and Tallyfy through middleware connections.

```d2
sequenceDiagram
autonumber
participant U as User
participant CRM as CRM/ERP
participant MW as Middleware
participant T as Tallyfy
Note over U,T: CRM to Tallyfy Flow (Magic Link)
U->>CRM: Click magic link button
CRM->>T: Launch process with data (name, company, deal ID)
T->>T: Create process Pre-fill forms
T->>U: Show assigned tasks
Note over U,T: Tallyfy to CRM Flow (Webhook)
U->>T: Complete form/task
T->>MW: Trigger webhook Send form data
MW->>MW: Process data Map fields
MW->>CRM: Update record Using saved ID
CRM->>MW: Confirmation
Note over CRM,T: Bidirectional Integration Complete
```

### What to notice

- **Record ID preservation**: The CRM record ID passes through the entire flow - first from CRM to Tallyfy (step 3), then back from Tallyfy to CRM (step 9) - ensuring updates hit the correct record
- **Middleware as the bridge**: Notice how middleware (steps 7-9) handles the complex data transformation and routing between Tallyfy's webhook format and your CRM's API requirements
- **Two distinct flows**: The diagram clearly separates launching Tallyfy processes from your CRM (steps 1-4) versus updating CRM records from Tallyfy (steps 6-10) - you can implement either or both based on your needs

Here's how information flows between systems:

#### 1. Start Tallyfy processes FROM your CRM/ERP

Want to launch Tallyfy workflows right from your CRM? Use a [magic link](/products/pro/launching/triggers/magic-links/) to create a button or link inside your CRM/ERP.

1. Create a Tallyfy magic link for the template you want to launch.
2. Set up the link to pull information (contact name, company, deal ID) from the CRM/ERP record.
3. Add this link as a button or clickable link within your CRM/ERP interface - typically on the Opportunity page.
4. User clicks the link? Tallyfy process starts instantly with all the CRM/ERP information already filled in.

#### 2. Send Tallyfy form data TO your CRM/ERP

You can also update your CRM/ERP records with information collected in Tallyfy forms. Here's how:

1. Set up a Tallyfy [webhook](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) to trigger when a specific Tallyfy form/task gets completed.
2. Use a middleware tool to catch the webhook data.
3. Configure the middleware to find the correct record in your CRM/ERP (using an ID passed from the CRM initially - see below) and update specific fields with the Tallyfy form answers.

**Important**: To update the *correct* record in your CRM/ERP (the right Contact or Deal), you'll need that record's unique ID. Pass this ID *from* the CRM/ERP *into* Tallyfy when the process starts (yes, using the magic link method above). Then you can use it later to find the right record to update.
