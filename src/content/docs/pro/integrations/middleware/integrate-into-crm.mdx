## Connecting Tallyfy to your CRM or ERP system

You can connect Tallyfy to your Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system (like Salesforce or SFDC, HubSpot, Microsoft Dynamics 365, etc.) or Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system such as Netsuite, SAP, etc. This connection lets you link your sales or operational processes managed in the CRM/ERP with detailed workflows that run in Tallyfy.

### Why connect Tallyfy to your CRM/ERP?

- **Save on licenses**: Run detailed operational workflows in Tallyfy without buying expensive CRM/ERP licenses for everyone who needs to be involved.
- **Consistent processes**: Ensure standard procedures (like client onboarding or support) are followed - even when you're involving teams outside the CRM/ERP.
- **Smooth handoffs**: Make transitions between teams (like Sales to Operations) trackable and seamless.
- **Better client experience**: Give clients a consistent journey from first contact through delivery.

### What CRMs cannot do (but Tallyfy works perfectly for)

CRMs excel at storing customer data and tracking sales activities. But they fall short when you need to manage complex operational workflows. Here's where businesses hit roadblocks with CRM-only approaches:

#### Inflexible task sequences
CRMs force you into rigid, linear task flows that can't handle real business complexity. Does your client onboarding need different steps based on deal size, location, or service type? You're stuck with manual workarounds or duplicate processes.

Tallyfy's [conditional automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/conditionals/) automatically show or hide steps based on form answers. Personalized workflows without the headache.

#### Missing accountability and notifications
Most CRMs require people to log in daily and manually check for pending tasks. No automatic assignment of next steps. No deadline management across complex multi-step processes. It's exhausting.

Tallyfy automatically assigns tasks to the right people at the right time, sends deadline reminders, and escalates overdue items - workflows move forward without manual oversight.

#### Fragmented cross-team collaboration  
CRMs work well for sales teams but what happens when processes involve people outside the system? Legal, Finance, external partners - information gets trapped in silos. Missed handoffs. Inconsistent execution.

Tallyfy lets you involve anyone - internal [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) or external [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) - in the same workflow. Everyone sees their specific tasks and deadlines.

#### Weak audit trails and compliance
CRMs track data changes but don't keep detailed records of who did what task, when, and in what order. For regulated industries or quality processes, this creates massive compliance gaps.

Every Tallyfy [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) automatically creates a complete audit trail. You see exactly what happened, when, and by whom - perfect for compliance reporting or process improvement.

#### Disconnected tool ecosystem
CRMs integrate with some tools, sure. But they can't coordinate complex workflows that span multiple systems. You end up with manual data entry between your CRM, project management tools, document systems, and communication platforms. Hours wasted.

Tallyfy sits above these tools, connecting them through [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) to create seamless end-to-end processes. Each tool does what it does best.

### Common connection examples

#### Lead management
- New lead appears in your CRM? Automatically kick off a lead qualification process in Tallyfy.
- Assign tasks in Tallyfy for researching or contacting the lead.
- Send updated lead information back to the CRM record.

#### Sales stage changes
- Deal moves to a new stage in your CRM (like "Proposal Sent")? The relevant Tallyfy process starts automatically (like "Contract Review").
- Include people who don't use the CRM (like Legal or Finance) in necessary steps.

#### Client onboarding
- Deal marked "Won" in the CRM? The detailed client onboarding process launches in Tallyfy instantly.
- Hand off tasks to the implementation or customer success team with zero friction.
- Even invite the client as a guest to participate in specific onboarding tasks.

#### Standardizing support
- Use Tallyfy to manage complex or multi-step customer support procedures.
- Ensure support agents follow consistent steps for specific types of issues - every single time.
- Train new support staff 3x faster using standard Tallyfy templates.

### How to connect using middleware or links

Most connections are built using [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) platforms (Zapier, Make, Power Automate, etc.). Direct links work too.

:::note[Choosing Middleware]
As mentioned elsewhere, Zapier is fine for simple links. For more robust connections, consider Make.com or Power Automate. Developers can use the Tallyfy API for full control.

Here's how information flows between systems:

#### 1. Start Tallyfy processes FROM your CRM/ERP

Want to launch Tallyfy workflows right from your CRM? Use a [magic link](/products/pro/launching/triggers/magic-links/) to create a button or link inside your CRM/ERP.

1. Create a Tallyfy magic link for the template you want to launch.
2. Set up the link to pull information (contact name, company, deal ID) from the CRM/ERP record.
3. Add this link as a button or clickable link within your CRM/ERP interface - typically on the Opportunity page.
4. User clicks the link? Tallyfy process starts instantly with all the CRM/ERP information already filled in.

#### 2. Send Tallyfy form data TO your CRM/ERP

You can also update your CRM/ERP records with information collected in Tallyfy forms. Here's how:

1. Set up a Tallyfy [webhook](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) to trigger when a specific Tallyfy form/task gets completed.
2. Use a middleware tool to catch the webhook data.
3. Configure the middleware to find the correct record in your CRM/ERP (using an ID passed from the CRM initially - see below) and update specific fields with the Tallyfy form answers.

**Important**: To update the *correct* record in your CRM/ERP (the right Contact or Deal), you'll need that record's unique ID. Pass this ID *from* the CRM/ERP *into* Tallyfy when the process starts (yes, using the magic link method above). Then you can use it later to find the right record to update.
