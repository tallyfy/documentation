## How to connect your sales processes with operational workflows

Tallyfy integrates with Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems such as Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics, HubSpot, Pipedrive, Zoho CRM, and other platforms. This article explains integration approaches and business use cases for combining CRM capabilities with Tallyfy's process management.

### Business value

Integrating Tallyfy with your CRM delivers several benefits:

- **Cost optimization** - Extend workflow capabilities without purchasing additional CRM user licenses
- **Process consistency** - Standardize workflows that extend beyond the sales team
- **Effective handoffs** - Ensure effective transitions between sales and operational teams
- **Client experience** - Provide a consistent client journey from sale to onboarding

### Key integration scenarios

#### Lead management processes

When new leads enter your CRM system:
- Launch qualification processes in Tallyfy automatically
- Assign team members to enrichment tasks
- Return enhanced data to CRM records

#### Sales stage transitions

When opportunities advance to new sales stages:
- Trigger appropriate Tallyfy workflows based on stage changes
- Involve non-CRM users in specialized activities
- Maintain process visibility across departments

#### Client onboarding

After a deal is marked as "Won" in your CRM:
- Launch comprehensive onboarding processes in Tallyfy
- Facilitate handoff to operations or customer success teams
- Invite clients to participate directly in onboarding activities
- Create a centralized communication and task hub

#### Support standardization

For customer support functions:
- Implement standard operating procedures (SOPs) in Tallyfy
- Ensure consistent handling of complex support cases
- Accelerate training for new support team members

### Integration methods

All integrations can be implemented using middleware platforms like Microsoft Power Automate, Zapier, Make.com, or MuleSoft. Additionally, some CRMs support direct UI integration, as shown below:

:::note[Considering Integration Alternatives]
While Zapier can be useful for simple connections, we generally recommend more capable and cost-effective middleware solutions like **n8n**, **Make**, or **Microsoft Power Automate** for serious integrations.

For maximum control and flexibility, especially if you have development resources, consider using Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) to build custom integrations, potentially leveraging AI to generate code for serverless functions.

There are two primary integration patterns:

#### 1. CRM-to-Tallyfy integration 

Launch Tallyfy processes from your CRM interface:

1. Create a button or link in your CRM using a [magic link](/products/pro/launching/triggers/magic-links/)
2. Configure the link to pass CRM data (contact information, opportunity details, etc.)
3. When clicked, the link launches a Tallyfy process with pre-populated fields

The following video demonstrates this implementation:

#### 2. Tallyfy-to-CRM integration

Send form field data collected in Tallyfy back to your CRM:

1. Configure webhooks in Tallyfy to trigger on form field completion
2. Set up middleware to receive webhook data
3. Use the middleware to update specific CRM record fields

**Important**: To update specific CRM records, you'll need the record ID (such as Lead ID or Opportunity ID). This identifier should be passed to Tallyfy during the initial process launch to enable accurate data mapping.
