## Connecting Tallyfy to your CRM or ERP system

You can connect Tallyfy to your Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system (like Salesforce, HubSpot, Dynamics, etc.) or Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system. This allows you to seamlessly link your sales or operational processes managed in the CRM/ERP with detailed workflows run in Tallyfy.

### Why connect Tallyfy to your CRM/ERP?

- **Save on licenses**: Run detailed operational workflows in Tallyfy without needing extra expensive CRM/ERP licenses for everyone involved.
- **Consistent processes**: Ensure standard procedures (like client onboarding or support) are followed even when involving teams outside the CRM/ERP.
- **Smooth handoffs**: Make transitions between teams (e.g., Sales to Operations) easier and trackable.
- **Better client experience**: Provide a consistent journey for clients from the first contact through delivery.

### Common connection examples

#### Lead management
- When a new lead appears in your CRM, automatically start a lead qualification process in Tallyfy.
- Assign tasks in Tallyfy for researching or contacting the lead.
- Send updated lead information back to the CRM record.

#### Sales stage changes
- When a deal moves to a new stage in your CRM (e.g., "Proposal Sent"), automatically start the relevant Tallyfy process (e.g., "Contract Review").
- Involve people who don't use the CRM (like Legal or Finance) in necessary steps.

#### Client onboarding
- When a deal is marked "Won" in the CRM, automatically start the detailed client onboarding process in Tallyfy.
- Easily hand off tasks to the implementation or customer success team.
- Even invite the client as a guest to participate in specific onboarding tasks in Tallyfy.

#### Standardizing support
- Use Tallyfy to manage complex or multi-step customer support procedures.
- Ensure support agents follow consistent steps for certain types of issues.
- Help train new support staff faster using standard Tallyfy templates.

### How to connect (using Middleware or Links)

Most connections are built using [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) platforms (Zapier, Make, Power Automate, etc.). Sometimes, direct links can also be used.

:::note[Choosing Middleware]
As mentioned elsewhere, Zapier is fine for simple links. For more robust connections, consider Make.com or Power Automate. Developers can use the Tallyfy API for full control.

There are two main ways information flows:

#### 1. Start Tallyfy processes FROM your CRM/ERP

Use a special Tallyfy [magic link](/products/pro/launching/triggers/magic-links/) to create a button or link inside your CRM/ERP.

1. Create a Tallyfy magic link for the template you want to launch.
2. Set up the link to pull information (like contact name, company, deal ID) from the CRM/ERP record.
3. Add this link as a button or clickable link within your CRM/ERP interface (e.g., on the Opportunity page).
4. When a user clicks the link/button, it starts the Tallyfy process and automatically fills in the information from the CRM/ERP.

See this video for a demonstration:

#### 2. Send Tallyfy form data TO your CRM/ERP

Update your CRM/ERP records with information collected in Tallyfy forms.

1. Set up a Tallyfy [webhook](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) to trigger when a specific Tallyfy form/task is completed.
2. Use a middleware tool to catch the webhook data.
3. Configure the middleware to find the correct record in your CRM/ERP (using an ID passed from the CRM initially - see note below) and update specific fields with the Tallyfy form answers.

**Important**: To update the *correct* record in your CRM/ERP (e.g., the right Contact or Deal), you usually need that record's unique ID. Make sure to pass this ID *from* the CRM/ERP *into* Tallyfy when the process starts (e.g., using the magic link in method 1), so you can use it later to find the right record to update.
