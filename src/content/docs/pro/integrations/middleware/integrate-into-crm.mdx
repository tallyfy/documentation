## How does Tallyfy integrate into CRM systems such as SFDC - Salesforce, Microsoft Dynamics, ERP's like Netsuite etc.?

This article explains integration points and use-cases for complimenting your CRM with Tallyfy.

CRM stands for Customer Relationship Management - and these are generally systems that maintain a list of contacts/tasks that sales people do during the sales lifecycle. Examples of CRM's are SFDC (otherwise known as Salesforce), Pipedrive, Hubspot, Zoho CRM, FreshSales, Nimble, PipelineDeals, Microsoft Dynamics, Close, etc.

Most CRM's e.g. SFDC are very expensive - so having Tallyfy fill in gaps so that you don't need to purchase a CRM user is very cost-effective - especially for people who have little or no involvement with sales.

These are the business use cases that may work with CRM's:

* When you get a new lead in your CRM - launch a Tallyfy process to qualify/enrich lead information.
* When a lead changes state in your CRM - launch a Tallyfy process to begin the detailed portion of that stage. This works especially well if the people who need to actually do this are not users of the CRM.

When you have won a deal in your CRM you move the stage/state to "Won" - then you can launch a client onboarding process on Tallyfy. Beyond the actual sale - client onboarding is often where a hand-off occurs to operations or customer success teams and is a very critical part of customer first impressions. What's more awesome is that you can actually invite clients into Tallyfy to do tasks or fill out forms. No client likes being bombarded by emails and calls during onboarding - so one place to look is amazing for them.

If you use the helpdesk tools in a CRM like the support/helpdesk offering of SFDC - you can also run SOP's for your technical/customer support staff on Tallyfy. This onboards a new support member really well - and ensures consistent responses to complex, decision-driven cases.

All the above integrations can be done easily via middleware systems. You can also do light UI integrations via Salesforce UI and related methods like Lightning, etc. - an example is shown below:

Below are two specific types of integrations into CRM's which can be natively built - using Salesforce (SFDC) as an example:

- Launch a Tallyfy process _from_ a link/button in your CRM and also pass through CRM data into Tallyfy.
- Send data _from__ Tallyfy into specific fields in your CRM using webhooks via middleware. Microsoft Power Automate, make.com,  Mulesoft, or numerous other platforms would probably work great as middleware.

## Launch a Tallyfy process from inside your CRM and pass through data

If you want to launch a process from your CRM (without leaving it) - as well as pass through CRM data into Tallyfy (e.g. first name, last name, email), that's easily achieved using a [magic link](/products/pro/launching/triggers/magic-links/) to launch the process. Please follow the steps in the video below.

## Send data from Tallyfy to specific fields in your CRM

While a process is running - Tallyfy lets you collect information via form fields - and this also applies to approval decisions e.g. "Approved? Yes/No".

If you want to push this data back _into_ your CRM - you can do so by emitting a webhook, catching it via your favorite middleware (e.g. Zapier), and then executing the update on your CRM. However, you will likely need the lead ID or object ID in your CRM to accurately know where exactly to target the data update, so Tallyfy needs to have that from the beginning.
