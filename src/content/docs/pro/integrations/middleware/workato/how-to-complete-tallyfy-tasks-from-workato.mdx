## Automatically complete Tallyfy tasks using Workato

Want to complete [Tallyfy tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) programmatically from your Workato recipes? You can trigger task updates based on events in other systems - perfect for creating seamless cross-platform workflows.

### Common use cases

- Mark Tallyfy tasks complete when a document is signed in DocuSign
- Complete approval tasks based on responses in Microsoft Forms
- Update Tallyfy task form fields when data changes in your CRM
- Auto-complete tasks when specific conditions are met in your ERP

### Prerequisites

- Workato account with HTTP connector access
- Tallyfy API token from **Settings > Integrations > REST API**
- Task IDs or a method to retrieve them dynamically
- Understanding of your task's [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/)

## Setting up task completion

### Step 1: Identify the Tallyfy task to complete

You'll need the task ID to complete it. Here's how to get it:

#### Option A: From a Tallyfy webhook

If Tallyfy triggered your Workato recipe via webhook:
```ruby
task_id = trigger["task"]["id"]
```

#### Option B: Search for tasks by process

Use an HTTP GET request to find tasks:
```
GET https://go.tallyfy.com/api/tasks?run_id={process_id}
```

#### Option C: Store task IDs

When launching processes, store the returned task IDs in a lookup table or database. Works great for recurring workflows.

### Step 2: Configure the completion request

<Steps>
1. Add an HTTP action to your Workato recipe
2. Configure the request:
   - **Method**: PUT
   - **URL**: `https://go.tallyfy.com/api/tasks/{task_id}/complete`
   - **Headers**:
     - `Content-Type: application/json`
     - `X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient`
3. Add the request body with form field data
</Steps>

### Step 3: Handle form fields

If the task has form fields that need values, include them in the request body:

```json
{
  "form_fields": {
    "approval_status": "Approved",
    "approver_name": "John Smith",
    "approval_date": "2024-03-15",
    "comments": "Looks good, approved for implementation"
  }
}
```

#### Dynamic field mapping

Map fields from your trigger data:

```ruby
{
  "form_fields": {
    "invoice_number": trigger["invoice"]["number"],
    "amount": trigger["invoice"]["total"],
    "payment_status": trigger["payment"]["status"],
    "processed_by": trigger["user"]["email"]
  }
}
```

## Advanced completion scenarios

### Conditional task completion

Need to complete tasks only when specific conditions are met? Easy.

<Steps>
1. Add a conditional action before the HTTP request
2. Check your conditions:
   ```ruby
   trigger["order"]["status"] == "shipped" AND 
   trigger["order"]["payment_status"] == "paid"
   ```
3. Place the completion HTTP action inside the conditional block
</Steps>

### Bulk task completion

Got multiple tasks to complete in a process? Here's the pattern:

<Steps>
1. First, get all tasks for a process:
   ```
   GET https://go.tallyfy.com/api/tasks?run_id={process_id}&status=active
   ```
2. Use a **For each** loop in Workato
3. Inside the loop, complete each task that matches your criteria
4. Add a 1-second delay between completions to avoid rate limits
</Steps>

### Updating without completing

Sometimes you just want to update form fields without marking the task complete - maybe you're collecting data incrementally:

```
PUT https://go.tallyfy.com/api/tasks/{task_id}
```

Request body:
```json
{
  "captures": {
    "field_name": "updated_value",
    "status": "In Progress"
  }
}
```

## Error handling strategies

### Common errors and solutions

| Error Code | Meaning | Solution |
|------------|---------|----------|
| 401 | Unauthorized | Check API token and headers |
| 404 | Task not found | Verify task ID and that it exists |
| 400 | Invalid data | Check form field names and data types |
| 422 | Validation failed | Ensure required fields are provided |

### Implementing retry logic

<Steps>
1. Click the error handler icon on your HTTP action
2. Add a **Retry** action for transient failures
3. Configure retry settings:
   - Max attempts: 3
   - Interval: 5 seconds
   - Backoff multiplier: 2
4. Add logging for permanent failures
</Steps>

## Recipe example: Complete task on document signature

Let's walk through a real-world recipe pattern:

<Steps>
1. **Trigger**: DocuSign - Document completed
2. **Action 1**: Search Tallyfy tasks by document ID
   ```
   GET https://go.tallyfy.com/api/tasks?search={document_id}
   ```
3. **Action 2**: Parse response to get task ID
4. **Action 3**: Complete the task with signature details
   ```json
   {
     "form_fields": {
       "signed_by": "{{trigger.signer_email}}",
       "signed_date": "{{trigger.completed_date}}",
       "document_url": "{{trigger.document_url}}",
       "signature_id": "{{trigger.envelope_id}}"
     }
   }
   ```
5. **Action 4**: Send confirmation email
</Steps>

## Best practices

### Performance optimization

- Cache frequently used task IDs (saves 200ms per request)
- Use batch operations when possible
- Implement connection pooling for high-volume scenarios
- Monitor API usage against rate limits

### Data integrity

- Validate data before sending to Tallyfy
- Log all completions for audit trails
- Implement rollback mechanisms for critical workflows
- Use idempotency keys to prevent duplicate completions

### Security considerations

- Never expose API tokens in logs
- Use Workato's secure storage for credentials
- Implement field-level encryption for sensitive data
- Audit recipe access regularly

## Troubleshooting guide

### Tallyfy task not completing?

Here's the troubleshooting checklist:

1. Verify the task is in "active" status
2. Check all required form fields are provided
3. Ensure the assigned user has permission
4. Confirm the task hasn't already been completed

### Form data not saving?

The culprit is usually one of these:

1. Field names must match exactly (case-sensitive)
2. Check data types (string vs number vs boolean)
3. Verify field exists in the task template
4. Ensure values meet field validation rules

### Getting 429 rate limit errors?

You're hitting our API too fast. Fix it with:

1. Add delays between requests
2. Implement exponential backoff
3. Batch operations where possible
4. Contact Tallyfy support for higher limits if needed

## Next steps

Ready to level up your integration? Consider these improvements:

- Set up Tallyfy webhooks to trigger completions in real-time
- Create reusable functions for common operations
- Build error notification workflows
- Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring
