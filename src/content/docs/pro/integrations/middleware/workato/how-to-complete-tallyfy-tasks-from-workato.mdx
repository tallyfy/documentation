## Complete Tallyfy tasks automatically from Workato recipes

You can complete [Tallyfy tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) from Workato recipes whenever something happens in another system - like a document getting signed or a CRM record updating. Here's how to set it up.

### Common use cases

- Mark tasks complete when a document is signed in DocuSign
- Complete approval tasks based on Microsoft Forms responses
- Update task [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) when CRM data changes
- Auto-complete tasks when ERP conditions are met

### Prerequisites

- Workato account with HTTP connector access
- Tallyfy API access token (from **Settings > Integrations > REST API**)
- Your Tallyfy organization ID
- Task IDs or a way to retrieve them dynamically

## Setting up task completion

### Step 1: Identify the task to complete

You'll need the task ID and the process (run) ID. Here's how to get them:

#### Option A: From a Tallyfy webhook

If Tallyfy triggered your recipe via webhook:
```ruby
task_id = trigger["task"]["id"]
run_id = trigger["task"]["run_id"]
```

#### Option B: List tasks for a process

Use an HTTP GET to retrieve tasks within a specific process:
```
GET https://go.tallyfy.com/api/organizations/{org_id}/runs/{run_id}/tasks
```

#### Option C: Store task IDs when launching

When you launch a process, store the returned task IDs in a lookup table. This works well for recurring workflows.

### Step 2: Configure the completion request

Task completion in Tallyfy uses a POST request (not PUT) to a `completed-tasks` endpoint[^1].

<Steps>
1. Add an HTTP action to your Workato recipe
2. Configure the request:
   - **Method**: POST
   - **URL**: `https://go.tallyfy.com/api/organizations/{org_id}/runs/{run_id}/completed-tasks`
   - **Headers**:
     - `Authorization: Bearer {your_access_token}`
     - `Content-Type: application/json`
     - `X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient`
3. Set the request body:
   ```json
   {
     "task_id": "{task_id}"
   }
   ```
</Steps>

For approval tasks, you must also include `is_approved`:
```json
{
  "task_id": "{task_id}",
  "is_approved": true
}
```

### Step 3: Save form field data before completing

If the task has form fields that need values, save them *before* completing the task. Tallyfy stores form field values (called "captures" in the API) through a separate endpoint:

```
POST https://go.tallyfy.com/api/organizations/{org_id}/tasks/{task_id}/captures
```

Each field is saved individually with its ID and value:
```json
{
  "id": 12345,
  "value": "Approved by John Smith"
}
```

You'll need to call this endpoint once per field, then complete the task afterward. The field `id` comes from the task's capture definitions.

## Advanced completion scenarios

### Conditional task completion

Only complete tasks when certain conditions are met:

<Steps>
1. Add a conditional action before the HTTP request
2. Check your conditions:
   ```ruby
   trigger["order"]["status"] == "shipped" AND
   trigger["order"]["payment_status"] == "paid"
   ```
3. Place the completion HTTP action inside the conditional block
</Steps>

### Bulk task completion

Need to complete several tasks in a process? Here's the pattern:

<Steps>
1. Get all tasks for the process:
   ```
   GET https://go.tallyfy.com/api/organizations/{org_id}/runs/{run_id}/tasks
   ```
2. Use a **For each** loop in Workato
3. Inside the loop, POST to `completed-tasks` for each matching task
4. Add a 1-second delay between calls to respect rate limits
</Steps>

### Updating form fields without completing

Sometimes you want to save form field data without marking the task done - maybe you're collecting data in stages. Use the captures endpoint:

```
POST https://go.tallyfy.com/api/organizations/{org_id}/tasks/{task_id}/captures
```

```json
{
  "id": 67890,
  "value": "updated_value"
}
```

You can also update other task properties (like deadline or assignees) via PUT:
```
PUT https://go.tallyfy.com/api/organizations/{org_id}/runs/{run_id}/tasks/{task_id}
```

## Error handling

### Common errors and solutions

| Error code | Meaning | Solution |
|------------|---------|----------|
| 401 | Unauthorized | Check your Bearer token and `X-Tallyfy-Client` header |
| 403 | Forbidden | Verify the organization ID is correct |
| 404 | Task not found | Confirm the task ID, run ID, and org ID are valid |
| 422 | Validation failed | Required form fields probably aren't filled yet |

### Retry logic

<Steps>
1. Click the error handler icon on your HTTP action
2. Add a **Retry** action for transient failures (5xx errors)
3. Configure:
   - Max attempts: 3
   - Interval: 5 seconds
   - Backoff multiplier: 2
4. Log permanent failures for review
</Steps>

## Recipe example: DocuSign signature triggers task completion

A real-world pattern - completing a Tallyfy task when someone signs a document:

<Steps>
1. **Trigger**: DocuSign - Document completed
2. **Action 1**: List tasks in the Tallyfy process to find the right task
   ```
   GET https://go.tallyfy.com/api/organizations/{org_id}/runs/{run_id}/tasks
   ```
3. **Action 2**: Save signature details to form fields
   ```
   POST https://go.tallyfy.com/api/organizations/{org_id}/tasks/{task_id}/captures
   ```
4. **Action 3**: Complete the task
   ```json
   {
     "task_id": "{task_id}"
   }
   ```
5. **Action 4**: Send confirmation email
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

### Task won't complete?

Run through this checklist:

1. Is the task in "active" status? Completed tasks can't be completed again.
2. Are all required form fields filled? The API returns a 422 if they aren't.
3. Does the user have permission? Tasks with `can_complete_only_assignees` set need an assigned user.
4. Are there unresolved issues? Tasks with open problem threads can't be completed.

### Form data not saving?

Usually one of these:

1. The field `id` must be the numeric capture ID - not the field name
2. The `value` must match the expected data type
3. Make sure the field actually exists on that task
4. Check that values meet any validation rules on the field

### Getting 429 rate limit errors?

You're sending requests too fast. Fix it by:

1. Adding delays between requests
2. Using exponential backoff
3. Reducing parallel operations
