## How can I connect Tallyfy to Workato for enterprise automation?

Workato represents an enterprise-grade integration and workflow automation platform specifically built for complex, large-scale business integrations and sophisticated workflow orchestration.

While Workato doesn't currently offer a pre-built Tallyfy connector, organizations can seamlessly integrate Tallyfy using Workato's robust HTTP connector capabilities or by developing custom connector solutions tailored to specific business requirements.

:::note[Alternative middleware options]
While Workato is powerful for enterprise use cases, consider these alternatives based on your needs:
- **Make.com** or **n8n** for cost-effective visual automation
- **Microsoft Power Automate** if you're heavily invested in Microsoft 365
- **Tallyfy's Open API** for maximum control with custom development
:::

## Why should I choose Workato for Tallyfy integration?

Workato provides exceptional value for enterprise Tallyfy integrations through:
- **Enterprise-scale integrations** with solid error handling and monitoring
- **Complex data transformations** between systems
- **Multi-step workflows** that involve multiple applications
- **Advanced security features** including encryption and compliance tools
- **Recipe versioning and deployment** across environments

Common Tallyfy integration scenarios include:
- Synchronizing Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) with enterprise ERP systems
- Automating [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) creation from CRM opportunities
- Integrating Tallyfy with HR systems for employee onboarding
- Connecting Tallyfy to financial systems for approval workflows

## Method 1: Using Workato's HTTP connector (recommended)

The HTTP connector is the quickest way to integrate Tallyfy with Workato, requiring no custom code.

### Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:
- A Workato account with access to HTTP connectors
- A Tallyfy account with [API access](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/)
- Your Tallyfy API token (gotten from **Settings > Integrations > REST API**)
- Your Tallyfy Organization ID

### Setting up the HTTP connection



<Steps>
1. In Workato, create a new recipe and add an HTTP connector
2. Set up the connection with these settings:
   - **Base URL**: `https://go.tallyfy.com/api/`
   - **Authentication type**: API key
   - **Authentication method**: Header authentication
   - **Header name**: `Authorization`
   - **Header value**: `Bearer YOUR_TALLYFY_API_TOKEN`
3. Add a custom header:
   - **Header name**: `X-Tallyfy-Client`
   - **Header value**: `APIClient`
4. Test the connection using a simple GET request to `/users/me`
</Steps>

### Common Tallyfy API operations in Workato

Here are the most useful Tallyfy API endpoints for Workato recipes:

- **Method**: POST
- **Endpoint**: `/runs`
- **Headers**:
  - `Content-Type: application/json`
  - `X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient`
- **Body** (JSON):
```json
{
  "blueprint_id": "YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID",
  "title": "Process Title",
  "owner_id": "USER_ID",
  "prerun": {
    "field_name": "field_value"
  }
}
```

  - `Content-Type: application/json`
  - `X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient`
- **Body** (JSON):
```json
{
  "comment": "Your comment text here"
}
```

### Handling Tallyfy webhooks in Workato

To receive real-time updates from Tallyfy:

<Steps>
1. Create a new Workato recipe with a **Webhook** trigger
2. Copy the webhook URL provided by Workato
3. In Tallyfy, configure the webhook in your template:
   - Go to the template editor
   - Add a webhook action to the relevant step
   - Paste the Workato webhook URL
   - Configure the payload data you want to send
4. In Workato, parse the incoming webhook data and trigger subsequent actions
</Steps>

## Method 2: Building a custom Tallyfy connector

For organizations needing a reusable, managed connector, you can build a custom Tallyfy connector using Workato's Connector SDK.

### Basic connector structure

Here's a basic template for a Tallyfy custom connector:

```ruby
{
  title: "Tallyfy",

  connection: {
    fields: [
      {
        name: "api_token",
        label: "API Token",
        optional: false,
        control_type: "password",
        hint: "Found in Settings > Integrations > REST API"
      },
      {
        name: "organization_id",
        label: "Organization ID",
        optional: false,
        hint: "Your Tallyfy Organization ID"
      }
    ],

    authorization: {
      type: "custom_auth",

      apply: lambda do |connection|
        headers(
          "Authorization": "Bearer #{connection['api_token']}",
          "X-Tallyfy-Client": "APIClient",
          "Content-Type": "application/json"
        )
      end
    },

    base_uri: lambda do |connection|
      "https://go.tallyfy.com/api"
    end
  },

  test: lambda do |connection|
    get("/users/me")
  end,

  actions: {
    launch_process: {
      title: "Launch a Process",

      input_fields: lambda do
        [
          { name: "blueprint_id", label: "Template ID", optional: false },
          { name: "title", label: "Process Title", optional: false },
          { name: "owner_id", label: "Owner User ID", optional: false }
        ]
      end,

      execute: lambda do |connection, input|
        post("/runs", input)
      end,

      output_fields: lambda do |object_definitions|
        [
          { name: "id", label: "Process ID" },
          { name: "title", label: "Process Title" },
          { name: "status", label: "Status" }
        ]
      end
    }
  }
}
```

### Implementing common actions

Add these actions to your custom connector for complete Tallyfy integration:

1. **List Templates** - Get available templates
2. **Get Process Details** - Grab information about a specific process
3. **Update Task** - Change task data or complete tasks
4. **Create Comment** - Add comments to tasks
5. **Upload File** - Attach files to tasks

## Best practices for Workato-Tallyfy integration

### Error handling

<Steps>
1. Set up retry logic for transient failures
2. Use Workato's error handling features to catch API errors
3. Log failed requests for debugging
4. Set up alerts for critical integration failures
</Steps>

### Performance optimization

- **Batch operations** when possible to cut down API calls
- **Cache frequently used data** like user IDs and template IDs
- **Use webhooks** instead of polling for real-time updates
- **Set up pagination** when retrieving large datasets

### Security considerations

- Store API tokens securely in Workato's connection management
- Use Workato's role-based access control for recipe management
- Regularly rotate API tokens
- Monitor API usage to spot unusual patterns

## Troubleshooting common issues

### Authentication errors

If you get 401 errors:
- Check that your API token is correct and active
- Make sure the `X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient` header is included
- Verify that your bearer token format is exactly `Bearer YOUR_TOKEN`

### Rate limiting

Tallyfy enforces rate limits of:
- 100 requests per minute per organization
- 1,000 requests per hour per organization

To manage rate limits in Workato:
- Set up exponential backoff
- Use bulk operations where available
- Track your API usage in recipe insights

### Data mapping issues

When mapping data between systems:
- Remember that Tallyfy's API uses different terminology than the UI
- API "blueprints" = UI "templates"
- API "runs" = UI "processes"
- API "captures" = UI "form fields"

## Next steps

After setting up your Tallyfy-Workato integration:
1. Test thoroughly with sample data
2. Document your recipes for team members
3. Set up monitoring and alerts
4. Consider building a library of reusable recipes
