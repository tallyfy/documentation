## Workato connector for Tallyfy

Tallyfy has a Workato connector built on Workato's Ruby SDK. It connects Tallyfy to enterprise systems through Workato's recipe-based automation - so you can launch processes, complete tasks, and track assignments across your tech stack without switching tools.

Contact [Tallyfy support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/) for access to the connector or guidance on getting started.

### What the connector does

The connector supports five actions and three polling triggers that cover the most common integration patterns.

**Actions:**

- **Start process** - launches a new process from a template, with dynamic kick-off form fields pulled from the template's configuration
- **Complete task** - marks a task as done, optionally submitting form data along with it
- **Update task** - changes a task's name, description, deadline, or assignees (users, guests, or groups)
- **Add comment** - posts a comment or problem report on a specific task
- **Get process** - retrieves process details, optionally including all its tasks

**Triggers (polling-based):**

- **New task assigned** - fires when a task gets assigned to the connected user
- **Process completed** - fires when a process reaches completed status
- **New process started** - fires when a new process is created, with optional filtering by template

### How authentication works

The connector uses OAuth 2.0. You'll need three pieces of information to set up the connection:

1. **Client ID** - from your Tallyfy OAuth application
2. **Client Secret** - from the same OAuth application
3. **Organization ID** - found in Tallyfy Settings > Organization

The OAuth flow goes through `account.tallyfy.com/oauth/authorize` for authorization and `account.tallyfy.com/oauth/token` for token exchange. Workato handles token refresh automatically, so you won't deal with expired sessions.

Every API call includes the `Authorization` bearer token header and an `X-Organization-ID` header.

### Architecture overview

```
Your Systems → Workato Platform → Tallyfy API
    ↓              ↓                  ↓
Salesforce    Recipe Engine     Start Process
SAP           Data Transform    Complete Task
Workday       Error Handling    Update Task
ServiceNow    Polling Triggers  Add Comment
```

### Dynamic kick-off form fields

When you pick a template in the "Start process" action, the connector fetches that template's kick-off form fields and generates matching input fields in Workato. It maps Tallyfy field types to Workato controls - text, number, date, dropdown, multiselect, boolean, email, and URL fields all get proper input types.

This means your recipes can pass data directly into Tallyfy's kick-off forms without manual field mapping.

### Example scenarios

**Deal-to-onboarding:** When a deal closes in Salesforce, a Workato recipe starts a Tallyfy customer onboarding process. The recipe maps the customer name, contract value, and account manager from CRM fields into the kick-off form.

**Task completion sync:** The "process completed" trigger watches for finished Tallyfy processes, then pushes status updates to your ERP or project management tool.

**Assignment routing:** The "new task assigned" trigger picks up fresh assignments and sends notifications through Slack, Teams, or email - whatever your team prefers.

### Key API endpoints used

The connector talks to Tallyfy's v2 API at `app.tallyfy.com`:

- `POST /api/v2/runs` - start a new process from a template
- `PUT /api/v2/runs/{process_id}/tasks/{task_id}` - complete or update a task
- `POST /api/v2/runs/{process_id}/tasks/{task_id}/comments` - add a comment to a task
- `GET /api/v2/runs/{process_id}` - get process details
- `GET /api/v2/tasks` - list tasks (used by the assignment trigger)
- `GET /api/v2/runs` - list processes (used by the process triggers)
- `GET /api/v2/blueprints` - list active templates for dropdown pick lists

### API terminology mapping

- "Templates" in the UI = "Blueprints" or "Checklists" in the API
- "Processes" in the UI = "Runs" in the API
- "Form fields" in the UI = "Captures" in the API
- "Steps" in templates = "Tasks" in running processes

### Guest assignment rules

The connector enforces Tallyfy's business rule that guests (external users) can't be the sole assignees on a task. If you assign only guest email addresses, the connector automatically adds the current user as a co-assignee. It also validates guest emails against the organization domain - if someone with an internal email is listed as a guest, the connector looks up their user ID instead.

### Error handling

The connector returns clear error messages for common failures:

- **401** - authentication failed, token refresh needed
- **403** - missing organization access
- **404** - resource doesn't exist or user lacks access
- **422** - validation errors with field-level details
- **429** - rate limit exceeded

### Getting started

To use the Tallyfy-Workato connector:

1. Contact [Tallyfy support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/) to get OAuth credentials
2. Set up the connection in Workato with your Client ID, Client Secret, and Organization ID
3. Build recipes using the connector's actions and triggers
4. Test with a sandbox template before going live
