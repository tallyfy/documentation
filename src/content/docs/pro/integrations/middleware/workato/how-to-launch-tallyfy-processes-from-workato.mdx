## Launch Tallyfy processes from Workato recipes

You can connect Workato to Tallyfy's API so that events in Salesforce, Zendesk, or any other system automatically start [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). Workato's HTTP connector sends a POST request to Tallyfy with your template ID and kick-off form data - no custom code needed.

### How the integration flows

```d2
direction: down

ES: "External System\n(Salesforce/Zendesk)" {
  shape: cylinder
  style.fill: "#e6f3ff"
}

W: "Workato Recipe" {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#ffe6e6"
}

HTTP: "HTTP Connector" {
  shape: hexagon
  style.fill: "#fff3cd"
}

T: "Tallyfy API" {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#e6ffe6"
}

ES -> W: "1. Trigger event\n(new opportunity)" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
}

W -> W: "2. Map trigger\ndata" {
  style.stroke: "#666"
  style.stroke-dash: 3
}

W -> HTTP: "3. Prepare API\nrequest" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
}

HTTP -> T: "4. POST to runs\nendpoint with auth" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
  style.stroke-width: 2
}

T -> T: "5. Validate request\n& create process" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
}

T -> HTTP: "6. Return process ID\n& details" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
  style.stroke-dash: 3
}

HTTP -> W: "7. Pass response\nback" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
  style.stroke-dash: 3
}

W -> W: "8. Log success\nor handle error" {
  style.stroke: "#666"
  style.stroke-dash: 3
}
```

**Key points:**
- Authentication (step 4) needs a Bearer token and the `X-Tallyfy-Client` header - missing either causes a 401 error
- Workato maps your trigger data into the `prerun` object, which populates kick-off form fields automatically (step 2)
- Error handling (step 8) catches authentication failures, bad template IDs, or data format issues

### Prerequisites

You'll need:
- A Workato account with HTTP connector access
- A Tallyfy account with API access
- Your Tallyfy API token from **Settings > Integrations > REST API**
- Your organization ID (found in **Settings > Organization**)
- The template ID for the process you want to launch

### Step 1 - Create the HTTP connection in Workato

<Steps>
1. In Workato, go to **Connections** and click **Create connection**
2. Search for and select **HTTP**
3. Name your connection (e.g., "Tallyfy API")
4. Configure these settings:
   - **Authentication type**: API key
   - **How to apply**: Header
   - **Authorization header format**: Custom
   - **Custom authorization header**: `Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN`
   - **Other headers**: Click **Add header** and add:
     - Name: `X-Tallyfy-Client`
     - Value: `APIClient`
5. Click **Connect** to save
</Steps>

### Step 2 - Create a recipe to launch processes

<Steps>
1. Create a new recipe in Workato
2. Choose your trigger (e.g., "New row in database", "New Salesforce opportunity")
3. Add an **HTTP** action
4. Select your Tallyfy HTTP connection
5. Configure the HTTP request:
   - **Request name**: Launch Tallyfy Process
   - **Method**: POST
   - **URL**: `https://go.tallyfy.com/api/organizations/YOUR_ORG_ID/runs`
   - **Request headers**: Add `Content-Type` with value `application/json`
</Steps>

> The URL includes your organization ID as a path segment. Don't pass `organization_id` in the request body - it belongs in the URL.

### Step 3 - Configure the request body

Add this JSON to the **Request body** field:

```json
{
  "checklist_id": "YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID",
  "name": "Process name from trigger data",
  "owner_id": "USER_ID",
  "prerun": {
    "field1_name": "value from trigger",
    "field2_name": "another value"
  }
}
```

The `checklist_id` is the template's timeline ID (what the API calls a "blueprint" internally). The `name` field sets the process title. The `owner_id` is optional - if omitted, the authenticated user becomes the owner.

#### Mapping dynamic data

Instead of hardcoding values, use Workato's Formula mode:

1. Click the **Formula** mode toggle
2. Build your JSON dynamically:

```ruby
{
  "checklist_id": "abc123",
  "name": "Order " + trigger["order_number"] + " - " + trigger["customer_name"],
  "owner_id": "user456",
  "prerun": {
    "customer_name": trigger["customer_name"],
    "order_value": trigger["total_amount"],
    "priority": trigger["priority"]
  }
}
```

### Step 4 - Handle kick-off form fields

If your template has a [kick-off form](/products/pro/launching/triggers/kick-off-forms/), populate those fields through the `prerun` object:

1. Check which kick-off form fields are required in your template
2. Map each field in the `prerun` section
3. Match data types (text, number, date, etc.)

Here's an example with different field types:
```json
{
  "checklist_id": "template123",
  "name": "New Employee: John Smith",
  "owner_id": "hr_manager_id",
  "prerun": {
    "employee_name": "John Smith",
    "start_date": "2026-03-15",
    "department": "Engineering",
    "salary": 75000,
    "remote_worker": true
  }
}
```

### Step 5 - Use the Tallyfy response

Tallyfy returns the created process details. You can capture these in your recipe:

<Steps>
1. Add a **Variable** action after your HTTP request
2. Name it "Process Details"
3. Map fields from the HTTP response:
   - `id` - The process ID
   - `name` - The process name
   - `created_at` - When it was created
</Steps>

### Step 6 - Add error handling

<Steps>
1. Click the HTTP action's error handler
2. Add actions for different error scenarios:
   - **401 Unauthorized**: Token expired or missing headers
   - **404 Not Found**: Template ID doesn't exist
   - **422 Unprocessable Entity**: Validation errors (missing required fields, bad data types)
3. Add email notifications for failures so you catch problems early
</Steps>

### Common integration patterns

#### Launch from a CRM opportunity

When a Salesforce opportunity hits "Closed Won," onboarding starts automatically:
1. Trigger: Salesforce - Updated opportunity
2. Condition: Status changed to "Closed Won"
3. Action: Launch Tallyfy customer onboarding process
4. Pass opportunity data to kick-off form

#### Launch from a support ticket

Route urgent tickets into a structured escalation process:
1. Trigger: Zendesk - New ticket
2. Condition: Priority = "Urgent"
3. Action: Launch Tallyfy escalation process

#### Scheduled launches

Run recurring processes on a schedule:
1. Trigger: Scheduler - Daily/Weekly/Monthly
2. Action: Launch Tallyfy process
3. Use date formulas for dynamic names

### Troubleshooting

#### Process won't launch?

- Confirm your API token is active and hasn't expired
- Check that the `X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient` header is included
- Verify the template ID is the timeline ID, not the template name
- Make sure the org ID in your URL is correct

#### Kick-off form data not appearing?

- Field names in `prerun` must match exactly (they're case-sensitive)
- Data types need to match field expectations
- Required fields can't be empty

#### Getting 422 validation errors?

The API returns detailed validation errors. Check the response body for a `details` object that tells you which fields failed and why.
