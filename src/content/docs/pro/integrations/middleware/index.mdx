## Connecting Tallyfy without coding using Middleware

Middleware platforms are online tools (like Zapier, Make, Power Automate) that act as connectors between Tallyfy and other apps your business uses (like CRMs, spreadsheets, email marketing tools, etc.). They let you send information back and forth automatically without needing to write any code.

### Why use Middleware?

|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **No Coding Needed**   | Connect apps without technical API knowledge.                    |
| **Faster Setup**       | Often quicker to set up connections than custom coding.        |
| **Less Maintenance**   | The middleware company keeps the connections working.            |
| **Visual Building**    | Design connections using drag-and-drop interfaces.               |
| **Many Connections**   | Access thousands of ready-made connections to popular apps.      |
| **Change Data Format** | Easily convert data from Tallyfy's format to another app's format. |
| **Handles Errors**     | Often includes ways to automatically retry failed transfers.     |
| **Scales Well**        | Can handle large amounts of data transfer.                       |

### Common ways to use Middleware with Tallyfy

1. **Start Tallyfy processes from other apps**
   - Automatically [launch](/products/pro/launching/) a Tallyfy [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) when something happens elsewhere (e.g., a new deal closes in your CRM).
   - Fill in Tallyfy [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) automatically with data from the other app.
   - Assign [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) based on info from the other system.

2. **Send Tallyfy data to other apps**
   - Push answers from Tallyfy [forms](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) into your CRM, ERP, or spreadsheets.
   - Update other systems when a Tallyfy process reaches a certain point.
   - Keep customer information synchronized between Tallyfy and other tools.

3. **Connect multiple apps together**
   - Build workflows that involve Tallyfy and several other applications.
   - Link different business processes that run in different tools.
   - Avoid manually copying information between systems.

### How to get started

1. **Plan**: Figure out exactly what information needs to move between Tallyfy and which other app(s).
2. **Choose**: Pick the middleware platform that best fits your needs and technical skill.
3. **Design**: Map out the steps: what triggers the data transfer? Where does the data go? Does it need changing?
4. **Build & Test**: Create the connection in the middleware tool and test it thoroughly.
5. **Monitor**: Keep an eye on it to make sure it keeps working correctly.
