## How to connect Tallyfy to your business applications without coding

Middleware platforms serve as intelligent connectors that enable seamless [integration](/products/pro/integrations/) between Tallyfy and your other business applications. These no-code/low-code solutions eliminate the complexity of direct [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) integration while providing robust data exchange capabilities.

### Key Advantages of Middleware

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Simplified Integration** | Connect systems without writing code or managing API endpoints |
| **Rapid Implementation** | Deploy integrations in hours or days rather than weeks or months |
| **Reduced Maintenance** | Middleware vendors maintain connections as [APIs](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) evolve |
| **Visual Workflow Design** | Build integration flows using intuitive drag-and-drop interfaces |
| **Pre-built Connectors** | Access thousands of ready-made connections to popular business applications |
| **Data Transformation** | Convert information between different formats and structures |
| **Error Handling** | Built-in retry logic and failure notifications |
| **Scalability** | Handle growing transaction volumes without performance degradation |

### Common Tallyfy Integration Scenarios

Middleware platforms enable numerous automation possibilities with Tallyfy:

1. **Process Initiation from External Systems**
   - [Launch](/products/pro/launching/) Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) when events occur in other applications
   - Populate [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) with data from the triggering system
   - Assign [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) based on external system information

2. **Data Synchronization**
   - Push completed [form data](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to CRM, ERP, or other systems
   - Update external databases when processes reach specific milestones
   - Keep customer records synchronized across platforms

3. **Multi-system Workflows**
   - Create comprehensive workflows spanning multiple applications
   - Connect separate business [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) into unified experiences
   - Eliminate manual handoffs between systems

### Recommended Middleware Platforms

Tallyfy integrates with several leading middleware solutions:

#### Zapier

:::note[Considering Integration Alternatives]
While Zapier can be useful for simple connections, we generally recommend more robust and cost-effective middleware solutions like **n8n**, **Make**, or **Microsoft Power Automate** for serious integrations.

For maximum control and flexibility, especially if you have development resources, consider using Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) to build custom integrations, potentially leveraging AI to generate code for serverless functions.
:::

- **Best for**: Small to medium businesses seeking simplicity
- **Key features**: 5,000+ app connections, easy visual editor, templates
- **Limitations**: Less suitable for complex transformations or enterprise needs
- [**View Zapier Guide →**](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/zapier/)

#### Microsoft Power Automate

- **Best for**: Organizations using Microsoft 365 ecosystem
- **Key features**: Deep Microsoft integration, advanced UI automation, AI Builder
- **Limitations**: More complex interface, stronger Microsoft focus
- [**View Power Automate Guide →**](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/)

#### Make.com (formerly Integromat)

- **Best for**: Technical users needing advanced capabilities
- **Key features**: Powerful data mapping, complex scenario design, visual debugging
- **Limitations**: Steeper learning curve for non-technical users

#### Workato

- **Best for**: Enterprise organizations with complex integration needs
- **Key features**: Enterprise security, comprehensive governance, AI-powered suggestions
- **Limitations**: Higher investment, enterprise-focused pricing

#### Tray.io

- **Best for**: Multi-step complex workflows with sophisticated logic
- **Key features**: Branching logic, iterators, data helpers, custom components
- **Limitations**: More technical approach, less template-driven

### Implementation Approach

To get started with middleware integration:

1. **Define your requirements** - Document the specific integrations needed
2. **Select an appropriate platform** - Choose based on your technical capabilities and existing systems
3. **Design your [integration](/products/pro/integrations/) flows** - Map out the data movement between systems
4. **Implement and test** - Build, test, and refine your integration
5. **Monitor and maintain** - Establish oversight to ensure continued operation
