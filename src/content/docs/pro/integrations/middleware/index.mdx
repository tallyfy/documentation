#### 1. How can I automatically initiate Tallyfy processes from external applications?
   - Launch processes when events happen in other systems (like when a deal closes in your CRM).
   - Pre-fill form fields with data from the triggering app - no manual data entry.
   - Assign tasks based on information from external systems.

#### 2. How can I distribute Tallyfy data to external systems automatically?
   - Push form responses to CRMs, ERPs, or spreadsheets.
   - Update external systems when processes hit milestones or complete.
   - Keep customer information synchronized across all your tools in real-time.

### What are the most effective Middleware platforms for Tallyfy integration?

Tallyfy works with all the major middleware platforms. Here's what you need to know about each:

#### Zapier

:::note[Choosing a Tool]
Zapier is good for simple connections, but honestly, it gets expensive fast. For more complex workflows or sending lots of data, consider **Make.com** or **Microsoft Power Automate**, which can be more powerful and cost-effective. For full control (and if you don't mind getting your hands dirty), developers can use Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/).
:::

- **Good for**: Beginners, simple connections.
- **Features**: Thousands of app connections, easy visual editor.
- **Downsides**: Can be less flexible for complex needs (and the pricing scales fast).
- [**View Zapier Guide →**](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/zapier/)

#### Microsoft Power Automate

- **Good for**: Companies using Microsoft 365 (and already drinking the Microsoft Kool-Aid).
- **Features**: Strong connection to Microsoft apps, can automate desktop tasks.
- **Downsides**: Interface can be more complex, best within Microsoft ecosystem.
- [**View Power Automate Guide →**](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/)

#### n8n

- **Good for**: Organizations wanting open-source flexibility and cost control (and who appreciate not being locked into vendor pricing).
- **Features**: Self-hosting option, visual workflows, code flexibility, 500+ integrations.
- **Downsides**: Requires more technical setup if self-hosting.
- [**View n8n Guide →**](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/n8n/)

#### Make.com (formerly Integromat)

- **Good for**: Users needing more advanced options (without Zapier's pricing anxiety).
- **Features**: Powerful data handling, visual design for complex flows.
- **Downsides**: Can be harder to learn initially.

#### Workato

- **Good for**: Large companies with complex needs (and enterprise budgets).
- **Features**: Strong security, good for managing many integrations, recipe versioning.
- **Downsides**: More expensive, aimed at enterprise users.
- [**View Workato Guide →**](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/workato/)

#### Tray.io

- **Good for**: Building very complex, multi-step workflows (when you need to get really fancy).
- **Features**: Handles complex logic and branching well.
- **Downsides**: More technical to use.

### How can I successfully implement Middleware integration with Tallyfy?

1. **Strategic Planning**: Figure out exactly what data needs to move between Tallyfy and your other apps. Which direction? How often? Get specific.
2. **Platform Selection**: Pick the middleware that matches your needs and technical skills. Don't overspend on features you won't use.
3. **Workflow Design**: Map out your integration - what triggers it, how data transforms, where it ends up.
4. **Implementation & Testing**: Build your connections and test everything. Really test it. Break it on purpose to see what happens.
5. **Ongoing Monitoring**: Set up monitoring so you know if something stops working. Trust me, you'll thank yourself later.

Follow these steps and you'll have a solid integration that actually works long-term.
