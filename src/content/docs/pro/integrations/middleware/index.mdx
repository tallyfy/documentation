## Connect Tallyfy without coding

Middleware platforms like Zapier, Make, and Power Automate connect Tallyfy to your other business apps - CRMs, spreadsheets, email tools, and more. They're visual tools that let you drag and drop connections between systems, with no coding required.

You don't need to wait for IT or hire developers. This integration-first approach is core to [how we built Tallyfy](/products/pro/miscellaneous/about-tallyfy/) - your data flows freely between all your tools.

### Implementation steps

1. **Plan**: Identify what data needs to move between Tallyfy and your other apps - which direction and how often.
2. **Pick a platform**: Choose the middleware that matches your needs and technical skills.
3. **Design**: Map out your integration - what triggers it, how data transforms, and where it ends up.
4. **Build and test**: Create your connections and test thoroughly, including failure scenarios.
5. **Monitor**: Set up alerts so you'll know if something stops working.
