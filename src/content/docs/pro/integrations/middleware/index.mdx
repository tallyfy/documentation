## Connect Tallyfy without coding

Middleware platforms like Zapier, Make, and Power Automate connect Tallyfy to your other business apps - CRMs, spreadsheets, email tools, you name it. They're visual tools that let you drag and drop connections between systems. No coding required.

Here's the thing: these tools put automation power directly in your hands. You don't need to wait for IT or hire developers. Finally, a way to connect systems without begging the dev team for help. This integration-first approach is core to [how we built Tallyfy](/products/pro/miscellaneous/about-tallyfy/) - your data flows freely between all your tools.

### What are common Middleware use cases with Tallyfy for business automation?

#### 1. How can I automatically initiate Tallyfy processes from external applications?
   - Launch processes when events happen in other systems (like when a deal closes in your CRM).
   - Pre-fill form fields with data from the triggering app - no manual data entry.
   - Assign tasks based on information from external systems.

#### 2. How can I distribute Tallyfy data to external systems automatically?
   - Push form responses to CRMs, ERPs, or spreadsheets.
   - Update external systems when processes hit milestones or complete.
   - Keep customer information synchronized across all your tools in real-time.

#### 3. How can I orchestrate multi-application workflows?
   - Build workflows that span Tallyfy and multiple other applications.
   - Coordinate processes running across different platforms.
   - Eliminate manual data entry between systems once and for all.

- **Downsides**: More technical to use.

### Implementation steps

1. **Strategic Planning**: Figure out exactly what data needs to move between Tallyfy and your other apps. Which direction? How often? Get specific.
2. **Platform Selection**: Pick the middleware that matches your needs and technical skills. Don't overspend on features you won't use.
3. **Workflow Design**: Map out your integration - what triggers it, how data transforms, where it ends up.
4. **Implementation & Testing**: Build your connections and test everything. Really test it. Break it on purpose to see what happens.
5. **Ongoing Monitoring**: Set up monitoring so you know if something stops working. Trust me, you'll thank yourself later.

Follow these steps and you'll have a solid integration that actually works long-term.
