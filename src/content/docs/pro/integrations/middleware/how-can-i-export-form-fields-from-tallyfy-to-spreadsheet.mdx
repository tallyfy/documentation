## Exporting Form Field Data to Spreadsheets

Tallyfy form field data can be automatically exported to spreadsheets to centralize information collection, enable reporting, or integrate with other business systems. This guide explains how to implement automated data streaming from your Tallyfy processes to cloud-based spreadsheets.

### Use Cases

Exporting form field data to spreadsheets supports numerous business scenarios:

- **Data aggregation** - Collect responses from multiple process instances in one location
- **Report generation** - Build dashboards based on form submissions
- **Historical tracking** - Maintain records of form field submissions over time
- **Data integration** - Share process information with other business systems
- **Team collaboration** - Allow multiple stakeholders to access collected data

### Implementation Options

You can export form field data using several middleware platforms:

- **Zapier** - User-friendly interface with pre-built spreadsheet integrations
- **Microsoft Power Automate** - Deep integration with Excel and other Microsoft products
- **Make.com** (formerly Integromat) - Advanced workflow automation capabilities
- **Custom API integration** - Direct connection using webhooks and custom code

### Basic Implementation Steps

The typical integration process follows these steps:

1. Configure a webhook in Tallyfy to trigger when a form is submitted
2. Set up a middleware automation to receive the webhook data
3. Map specific form fields to spreadsheet columns
4. Format data as needed for your spreadsheet structure
5. Push the data to your chosen spreadsheet platform (Google Sheets, Excel Online, etc.)

### Video Tutorial

The following video demonstrates how to export form field values from Tallyfy to a spreadsheet using Zapier as the middleware platform:

While this example uses Zapier, the same principles apply when implementing the solution with Microsoft Power Automate or other middleware services.
