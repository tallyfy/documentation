## How to automatically send form answers to spreadsheets

You can set up Tallyfy to automatically send the answers entered into your [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to a spreadsheet (like Google Sheets or Excel Online). This is useful for gathering data in one place for reporting or connecting to other tools. You typically use a [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) tool (like Zapier, Make, or Power Automate) to make this connection.

### Why send form data to spreadsheets?

- **Collect data**: Gather answers from many different runs of a process into one central sheet.
- **Create reports**: Use the spreadsheet data to build charts or reports.
- **Keep records**: Have a historical log of all form submissions.
- **Connect systems**: Use the spreadsheet as a bridge to send Tallyfy data to other business tools.
- **Share data**: Make collected information easily accessible to team members.

### How to set it up using middleware

You can use different [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) tools to connect Tallyfy to your spreadsheet:

- **Zapier**: Generally easy to use with lots of pre-built connections.
- **Microsoft Power Automate**: Good choice if you use Microsoft 365 (Excel Online, SharePoint).
- **Make.com** (formerly Integromat): Offers powerful features for complex workflows.
- **Custom Code**: Developers can use Tallyfy [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) and the [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) to build a direct connection.

:::note[Choosing a Tool]
For simple connections, Zapier is fine. For more complex needs or higher volume, consider **Make.com** or **Microsoft Power Automate**. Using the Tallyfy **API** directly offers the most control but requires coding.

### General setup steps

While the exact clicks vary by middleware tool, the basic process is:

<Steps>
1. In Tallyfy, set up a [webhook](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) on the template step that contains the form. Configure it to trigger when the task/form is completed.
2. In your middleware tool (Zapier, Make, etc.), create a new workflow that starts with a "Webhook" trigger, using the URL Tallyfy gives you.
3. Add an action step in your middleware workflow to connect to your spreadsheet app (Google Sheets, Excel Online).
4. Configure the action to "Add a new row" (or similar).
5. Match the data coming from the Tallyfy webhook (the form field answers) to the correct columns in your spreadsheet.
6. Test the workflow to make sure data appears correctly in your spreadsheet.
</Steps>

### Video example using Zapier

This video shows the process using Zapier, but the main ideas apply to other middleware tools too:
