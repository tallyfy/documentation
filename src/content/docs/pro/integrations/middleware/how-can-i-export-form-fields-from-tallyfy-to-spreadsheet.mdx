## Export form fields to spreadsheets automatically

When a task gets completed in Tallyfy, a [webhook](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) fires with all [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) responses included in the payload. [Middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) platforms like Zapier, Make, or Power Automate catch that payload and push it into Google Sheets or Excel Online - no manual copying needed.

### Why export form data to spreadsheets?

- **One place for all responses** - every completed form lands in a single spreadsheet automatically
- **Reporting ready** - build charts and dashboards with Excel or Google Sheets' built-in tools
- **Audit trail** - each submission gets logged permanently for compliance
- **Data hub** - spreadsheets connect to almost everything else your team uses

### Pick a middleware tool

- **Zapier** - easiest to start with, lots of pre-built connections
- **Microsoft Power Automate** - best fit if you're already on Microsoft 365
- **Make.com** - more powerful for complex workflows, steeper learning curve
- **Custom code** - connect directly using Tallyfy [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) and the [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) for full control

### General setup steps

<Steps>
1. In Tallyfy, add a [webhook](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) URL on the template step that contains your form. The webhook fires when that task is completed.
2. In your middleware tool (Zapier, Make, etc.), create a workflow triggered by an incoming webhook.
3. Add an action step that connects to your spreadsheet app (Google Sheets, Excel Online).
4. Choose "Add a new row" (or equivalent) as the action.
5. Map the form field values from the Tallyfy webhook payload - each field arrives with its alias, label, and value - to the correct spreadsheet columns.
6. Test the workflow and confirm data appears in your spreadsheet.
</Steps>

### Video example using Zapier

This video walks through Zapier setup. The same principles apply to other middleware tools:
