## How to export form field data to spreadsheets using middleware

Tallyfy [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) data can be automatically exported to spreadsheets to centralize information collection, enable reporting, or integrate with other business systems. This guide explains how to implement automated data streaming from your Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) to cloud-based spreadsheets.

### Use cases

Exporting [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) data to spreadsheets supports numerous business scenarios:

- **Data aggregation** - Collect responses from multiple process instances in one location
- **Report generation** - Build dashboards based on form submissions
- **Historical tracking** - Maintain records of form field submissions over time
- **Data [integration](/products/pro/integrations/)** - Share process information with other business systems
- **Team collaboration** - Allow multiple stakeholders to access collected data

### Implementation options

You can export [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) data using several [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) platforms:

- **Zapier** - User-friendly interface with pre-built spreadsheet integrations
- **Microsoft Power Automate** - Deep integration with Excel and other Microsoft products
- **Make.com** (formerly Integromat) - Advanced workflow automation capabilities
- **Custom [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) integration** - Direct connection using [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) and custom code

:::note[Considering Integration Alternatives]
While Zapier can be useful for simple connections, we generally recommend more capable and cost-effective [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) solutions like **n8n**, **Make**, or **Microsoft Power Automate** for serious integrations.

For maximum control and flexibility, especially if you have development resources, consider using Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) to build custom integrations, potentially leveraging AI to generate code for serverless functions.

### Basic implementation steps
The typical [integration](/products/pro/integrations/) process follows these steps:

<Steps>
1. Configure a [webhook](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) in Tallyfy to trigger when a form is submitted
2. Set up a middleware [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) to receive the webhook data
3. Map specific [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to spreadsheet columns
4. Format data as needed for your spreadsheet structure
5. Push the data to your chosen spreadsheet platform (Google Sheets, Excel Online, etc.)
</Steps>

### Video tutorial

The following video demonstrates how to export [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) values from Tallyfy to a spreadsheet using Zapier as the [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) platform:

While this example uses Zapier, the same principles apply when implementing the solution with Microsoft Power Automate or other middleware services.
