## How can I export Tallyfy form fields to spreadsheets automatically?

Tallyfy enables automatic transmission of [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) responses to spreadsheet applications including Google Sheets and Excel Online through sophisticated automation workflows.

This capability proves valuable for centralized data collection, comprehensive reporting, and seamless integration with other business tools. [Middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) platforms like Zapier, Make, or Power Automate facilitate these automated connections between Tallyfy and spreadsheet applications.

### Why should I export Tallyfy form data to spreadsheets?

Exporting form data to spreadsheets delivers multiple business advantages enabling better data utilization and workflow integration:

- **Centralized Data Collection**: Aggregate responses from multiple process executions into unified spreadsheet repositories
- **Advanced Reporting**: Leverage spreadsheet capabilities to build sophisticated charts, dashboards, and analytical reports
- **Historical Record Keeping**: Maintain comprehensive logs of all form submissions for audit and compliance purposes
- **System Integration**: Utilize spreadsheets as data bridges connecting Tallyfy information with other business applications
- **Enhanced Data Sharing**: Provide team members with easily accessible, collaborative data access through familiar spreadsheet interfaces

### How to set it up using middleware

You can use different [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) tools to connect Tallyfy to your spreadsheet:

- **Zapier**: Generally easy to use with lots of pre-built connections.
- **Microsoft Power Automate**: Good choice if you use Microsoft 365 (Excel Online, SharePoint).
- **Make.com** (formerly Integromat): Offers powerful features for complex workflows.
- **Custom Code**: Developers can use Tallyfy [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) and the [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) to build a direct connection.

:::note[Choosing a Tool]
For simple connections, Zapier is fine. For more complex needs or higher volume, consider **Make.com** or **Microsoft Power Automate**. Using the Tallyfy **API** directly offers the most control but requires coding.

### General setup steps

While the exact clicks vary by middleware tool, the basic process is:

<Steps>
1. In Tallyfy, set up a [webhook](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) on the template step that contains the form. Configure it to trigger when the task/form is completed.
2. In your middleware tool (Zapier, Make, etc.), create a new workflow that starts with a "Webhook" trigger, using the URL Tallyfy gives you.
3. Add an action step in your middleware workflow to connect to your spreadsheet app (Google Sheets, Excel Online).
4. Configure the action to "Add a new row" (or similar).
5. Match the data coming from the Tallyfy webhook (the form field answers) to the correct columns in your spreadsheet.
6. Test the workflow to make sure data appears correctly in your spreadsheet.
</Steps>

### Video example using Zapier

This video shows the process using Zapier, but the main ideas apply to other middleware tools too:
