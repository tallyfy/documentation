## How can I export Tallyfy form fields to spreadsheets automatically?

You can automatically send [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) responses from Tallyfy straight to Google Sheets or Excel Online. No manual copying needed.

Here's why this matters: your form data flows directly into spreadsheets for instant reporting and analysis. [Middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) platforms like Zapier, Make, or Power Automate handle the connection - they're the bridge between Tallyfy and your favorite spreadsheet app.

### Why should I export Tallyfy form data to spreadsheets?

Let's be honest - spreadsheets are where most teams actually analyze their data. When you export Tallyfy form responses, you unlock several practical benefits:

- **Centralized Data Collection**: All your process responses land in one spreadsheet. Simple.
- **Advanced Reporting**: Build charts and dashboards using Excel or Google Sheets' built-in tools
- **Historical Record Keeping**: Every form submission gets logged permanently for audits and compliance checks
- **System Integration**: Spreadsheets connect to almost everything - use them as your data hub
- **Better Data Sharing**: Your team already knows spreadsheets (no training required)

### How to set it up using middleware

Pick a [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) tool that fits your needs:

- **Zapier**: Great for beginners. Lots of pre-built connections make setup take about 10 minutes.
- **Microsoft Power Automate**: Perfect if you're already using Microsoft 365 (works smoothly with Excel Online).
- **Make.com** (formerly Integromat): More powerful but takes longer to learn - worth it for complex workflows.
- **Custom Code**: Your developers can connect directly using Tallyfy [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) and the [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/).

:::note[Choosing a Tool]
For simple connections, Zapier is fine. For more complex needs or higher volume, consider **Make.com** or **Microsoft Power Automate**. Using the Tallyfy **API** directly offers the most control but requires coding.

### General setup steps

The setup process stays pretty consistent across middleware tools. Here's what you'll do:

<Steps>
1. In Tallyfy, set up a [webhook](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) on the template step that contains the form. Configure it to trigger when the task/form is completed.
2. In your middleware tool (Zapier, Make, etc.), create a new workflow that starts with a "Webhook" trigger, using the URL Tallyfy gives you.
3. Add an action step in your middleware workflow to connect to your spreadsheet app (Google Sheets, Excel Online).
4. Set up the action to "Add a new row" (or similar).
5. Match the data coming from the Tallyfy webhook (the form field answers) to the correct columns in your spreadsheet.
6. Test the workflow to make sure data shows up correctly in your spreadsheet.
</Steps>
