title: Connecting Power Automate to external data sources
---

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Want to connect Tallyfy to your databases and forms? Power Automate makes it happen. You can push data into Tallyfy, pull it out for reports, or trigger workflows when specific events occur in external systems.

This article covers two practical scenarios: connecting SQL databases to Tallyfy and using Microsoft Forms responses to kick off Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). We'll walk through real examples you can implement today.

Here's the thing - Tallyfy already offers direct integration options through its [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/), [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/), and the Tallyfy Power Automate [connector](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/). You've got choices.

## Working with databases (e.g., SQL Server) to support Tallyfy

Your databases hold valuable business data. Let's get that data working with Tallyfy - whether you're logging process outcomes for reporting or triggering workflows based on database changes.

*   **Why connect Tallyfy to a database via Power Automate?**
    *   **Log Tallyfy data for reporting:** Automatically log details of completed Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) or specific [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) outcomes into a SQL database for advanced reporting. This can supplement [Tallyfy Analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/).
    *   **Archive Tallyfy details:** Systematically archive Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) information, including [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) data, into a data warehouse.
    *   **Trigger Tallyfy from database events:** When a new record is added to a database (e.g., a new customer in a CRM's database), a Power Automate flow can trigger and launch a Tallyfy "New Customer Onboarding" [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).

*   **SQL Server connector in Power Automate:**
    The SQL Server [connector](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/understanding-power-automate-basics/) gives you these options:
    *   **Triggers:** `When an item is created (V2)`, `When an item is modified (V2)`.
    *   **Actions:** `Get rows (V2)`, `Insert row (V2)`, `Update row (V2)`, `Delete row (V2)`, `Execute SQL query (V2)`.

*   **Setting up a connection:** You'll need your server name, database name, and authentication details. Takes about 2 minutes.

*   **Example: logging Tallyfy task completion to SQL**

<Steps>

1.  **Trigger: Tallyfy - "When a task is completed".**
	*   Configure this to monitor a specific Tallyfy [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) or task name. See [creating your first flow](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/creating-your-first-flow-in-power-automate/) for trigger basics.

2.  **Action: Tallyfy - "Get task details".**
	*   Use the `Task ID` from the trigger to fetch all data for the completed Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), including custom [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/).

3.  **Action: SQL Server - "Insert row (V2)".**
	*   Establish or select your SQL Server connection.
	*   **Server name, Database name, Table name:** Select the appropriate values for your target database and table.
	*   **Row:** The action will display fields corresponding to your SQL table's columns. Map dynamic content from the "Get task details" step (e.g., Task Name, Completion Date, Assigned User Email, specific form field values like `outputs('Get_task_details')?['body/forms/YourFormFieldName/value']`) to these columns.



</Steps>

## Processing Microsoft Forms responses to initiate Tallyfy processes

Need a simple way for users to kick off Tallyfy workflows? Microsoft Forms provides an easy front-end, and Power Automate connects the dots. Users fill out a form, Tallyfy launches the right process. Done.

*   **Why use Microsoft Forms with Tallyfy via Power Automate?**
    *   **User-friendly Tallyfy process initiation:** Use a simple Microsoft Form for users to submit requests that kick off a Tallyfy [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) (e.g., an IT support request form that launches a Tallyfy support [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/)).
    *   **Detailed data collection for Tallyfy:** Collect information through a Form and use Power Automate to populate multiple [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) in a Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) or launch form.
    *   **Feedback loop for Tallyfy:** Gather feedback about a completed Tallyfy [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) using a Form, and use Power Automate to link this feedback back to the specific Tallyfy process instance.

*   **Microsoft Forms connector:** (check out [understanding Power Automate basics](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/understanding-power-automate-basics/) for connector details)
    *   **Trigger:** `When a new response is submitted`.
    *   **Action:** `Get response details`.

*   **Example: launch Tallyfy Process from Form submission**

<Steps>

1.  **Create your Microsoft Form.**
	*   Design a form (e.g., "New Project Request Form") with fields like Project Name, Client, Project Description, and Requested Deadline.

2.  **Trigger: Forms - "When a new response is submitted".**
	*   In Power Automate, create an automated flow.
	*   Select this trigger and choose your newly created form from the **Form Id** dropdown.

3.  **Action: Forms - "Get response details".**
	*   **Form Id:** Select the same form again.
	*   **Response Id:** Use the `Response Id` dynamic content from the trigger step.



4.  **Action: Tallyfy - "Launch process".**
	*   Select your Tallyfy "New Project Setup" [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).
	*   **Run Name:** Create a descriptive name using Form data, e.g., `Project: [Project Name from Forms output]`.
	*   **Launch Form Fields:** Map the dynamic content outputs from the "Get response details" step to the corresponding launch [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) in your Tallyfy template.

</Steps>

## Gathering user input in manual flows for Tallyfy (recap)

Remember those [button flows](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/triggering-flows-manually-button-flows/)? They can grab user input on the fly.

Why does this matter here? Because user input is external data too. When someone clicks your button flow and types in "Client Name" and "Issue Description," Power Automate can instantly create a high-priority [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in your Tallyfy support [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). It's that direct.

## Tips for data integration with Tallyfy

*   **Data type compatibility:** Watch your data types - Tallyfy expects specific formats. Use Power Automate [expressions](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/advanced-conditions-and-expressions/) like `int()` or `string()` to convert when needed.
*   **Unique Tallyfy identifiers:** Always log Process ID or Task ID when sending Tallyfy data to external systems. You'll thank yourself later when tracking down specific records.
*   **Inspect with "Compose":** Can't figure out what data you're getting? Drop in a "Compose" action (see [working with data operations and variables](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/working-with-data-operations-and-variables/)) to inspect payloads during testing.
*   **Tallyfy [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) as an alternative:** Hit a wall with the connector? Power Automate's HTTP action plus Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) can handle complex scenarios the connector can't.
