Power Automate can connect Tallyfy to your databases and forms. Push data into Tallyfy, pull it out for reports, or trigger workflows when external systems change.

This article covers two scenarios: connecting SQL databases to Tallyfy and using Microsoft Forms responses to launch Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).

Tallyfy also offers direct integration through its [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/), [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/), and the Tallyfy Power Automate [connector](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/).

## Working with databases (e.g. SQL Server)

*   **Why connect Tallyfy to a database via Power Automate?**
    *   **Log Tallyfy data for reporting** - Automatically write completed [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) or [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) details into a SQL database for reporting beyond what [Tallyfy Analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/) provides.
    *   **Archive Tallyfy details** - Store [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) information including [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) data in a data warehouse.
    *   **Trigger Tallyfy from database events** - When a new record appears (e.g. a new customer in your CRM database), launch a Tallyfy onboarding [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) automatically.

*   **SQL Server connector in Power Automate:**
    The SQL Server [connector](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/understanding-power-automate-basics/) provides:
    *   **Triggers:** `When an item is created (V2)`, `When an item is modified (V2)`.
    *   **Actions:** `Get rows (V2)`, `Insert row (V2)`, `Update row (V2)`, `Delete row (V2)`, `Execute SQL query (V2)`.

*   **Setting up a connection:** You need your server name, database name, and authentication details.

*   **Example: logging Tallyfy task completion to SQL**

<Steps>

1.  **Trigger: Tallyfy - "When a task is completed".**
	*   Configure this for a specific Tallyfy [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) or task name. See [creating your first flow](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/creating-your-first-flow-in-power-automate/) for trigger basics.

2.  **Action: Get task details using the Tallyfy connector or an HTTP action with the Tallyfy [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/).**
	*   Use the `Task ID` from the trigger to fetch data for the completed [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), including [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/).

3.  **Action: SQL Server - "Insert row (V2)".**
	*   Select your SQL Server connection, database, and table.
	*   Map dynamic content from the task details step (e.g. Task Name, Completion Date, form field values) to your SQL table columns.



</Steps>

## Using Microsoft Forms to launch Tallyfy processes

Microsoft Forms gives users a simple front-end. They fill out a form, Power Automate launches the right Tallyfy process.

*   **Why use Microsoft Forms with Tallyfy?**
    *   **Simple process initiation** - Users submit a Form (e.g. an IT support request) that launches a Tallyfy [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).
    *   **Data collection** - Collect information through a Form and populate [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) in a Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) or kick-off form.
    *   **Feedback loops** - Gather feedback about a completed [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) and link it back to the specific Tallyfy process instance.

*   **Microsoft Forms connector:** (see [understanding Power Automate basics](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/understanding-power-automate-basics/))
    *   **Trigger:** `When a new response is submitted`.
    *   **Action:** `Get response details`.

*   **Example: launch a Tallyfy process from a Form submission**

<Steps>

1.  **Create your Microsoft Form.**
	*   Design a form (e.g. "New Project Request") with fields like Project Name, Client, Description, and Deadline.

2.  **Trigger: Forms - "When a new response is submitted".**
	*   Create an automated flow in Power Automate and select your form from the **Form Id** dropdown.

3.  **Action: Forms - "Get response details".**
	*   Select the same Form Id and use the `Response Id` dynamic content from the trigger.

4.  **Action: Tallyfy - "Launch process".**
	*   Select your Tallyfy [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).
	*   **Run Name:** Build a descriptive name using Form data, e.g. `Project: [Project Name]`.
	*   **Kick-off Form Fields:** Map outputs from "Get response details" to the corresponding [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) in your Tallyfy template.

</Steps>

## Gathering user input in manual flows (recap)

[Button flows](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/triggering-flows-manually-button-flows/) can also collect external data. When someone clicks a button flow and enters "Client Name" and "Issue Description," Power Automate can instantly create a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in your Tallyfy support [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).

## Tips for data integration

*   **Data type compatibility** - Tallyfy expects specific formats. Use Power Automate [expressions](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/advanced-conditions-and-expressions/) like `int()` or `string()` to convert when needed.
*   **Log Tallyfy identifiers** - Always store Process ID or Task ID when sending data to external systems. This makes it easy to trace records later.
*   **Inspect with "Compose"** - Use a "Compose" action (see [data operations and variables](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/working-with-data-operations-and-variables/)) to inspect payloads during testing.
*   **Use the [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) when needed** - Power Automate's HTTP action with Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) handles scenarios the connector does not cover.
