snippet: Make your Power Automate flows intelligent by adding conditional logic to perform different actions based on specific criteria related to Tallyfy.
title: Using conditional logic in Power Automate
---

Automated workflows become truly powerful when they can make decisions. In Power Automate, **conditional logic** is key to building flows that adapt to different situations and perform different actions based on specific criteria from your Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). This allows you to create more flexible and intelligent automations for your Tallyfy workflows.

## Introduction to conditional logic for Tallyfy integrations

Conditional logic enables your Power Automate flow to answer a question about Tallyfy data and then act based on the answer. If a certain condition related to a Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) or [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) is true, the flow goes one way; if false, it goes another.

Why is this crucial for Tallyfy? Imagine a Tallyfy [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) for customer support. With conditional logic, Power Automate could check a "Priority" [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) in a Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/): if "High," the flow might escalate it; if "Low," it might log it for routine follow-up, all interacting with Tallyfy or other systems.

## The "Condition" control for Tallyfy data

<Steps>

1.  **Adding a condition:** In your flow, click **+ New step** and search for `Condition`. Select it from the Controls category.

2.  **Structure:** The Condition control presents an IF/THEN/ELSE structure for your Tallyfy data evaluation:
    *   **IF:** Define your condition(s) based on Tallyfy data.
    *   **IF YES (THEN):** Actions here execute if the Tallyfy-related condition is true.
    *   **IF NO (ELSE):** Actions here execute if the Tallyfy-related condition is false.

3.  **Defining the condition:**
    *   **Value 1:** Select dynamic content from Tallyfy (e.g., output of a Tallyfy [connector](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/) action like "Get task details") or enter a static value.
    *   **Operator:** Select a comparison operator from the dropdown menu. Common operators include:
        *   `is equal to` / `is not equal to`
        *   `contains` / `does not contain` (for text)
        *   `is greater than` / `is less than` (for numbers or dates)
        *   `starts with` / `ends with` (for text)
        *   `is empty` / `is not empty` (to check if a field has a value)
    *   **Value 2:** Click in the second box ("Choose a value"). Again, this can be dynamic content or a static value that Value 1 will be compared against.

</Steps>

## Building a flow with simple conditional logic for Tallyfy

Let's illustrate with a Tallyfy scenario: When a Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) is completed, check a specific [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) (e.g., "Approval Outcome") and send different email notifications based on its value.

<Steps>

1.  **Trigger: Tallyfy - "When a task is completed".**
    *   Start a new automated [cloud flow](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/understanding-power-automate-basics/).
    *   Select the Tallyfy trigger **When a task is completed**.
    *   Configure it to monitor a specific Tallyfy [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) (Blueprint ID).

2.  **Action: Tallyfy - "Get task details".**
    Add this Tallyfy action to get all [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) data.
    *   **Task ID:** Use the `Task ID` dynamic content from the trigger.

3.  **Control: "Condition".**
    Add a Condition control.
    *   **Value 1:** From dynamic content, select the output from "Get task details" for your "Approval Outcome" [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) (e.g., `outputs('Get_task_details')?['body/forms/ApprovalOutcome/value']`).
    *   **Operator:** Select `is equal to`.
    *   **Value 2:** Type `Approved`.

4.  **IF YES branch actions:**
    If the Tallyfy "Approval Outcome" is "Approved":
    *   Add action: **Send an email (V2)**.
    *   **To:** Relevant stakeholder.
    *   **Subject:** `Tallyfy Task '[Task Name from Get task details]' was Approved`.
    *   **Body:** Provide details, perhaps linking to the Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/).

5.  **IF NO branch actions:**
    If the Tallyfy "Approval Outcome" is not "Approved":
    *   Add action: **Send an email (V2)**.
    *   **To:** Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) assignee (`Assigned To Email` from "Get task details").
    *   **Subject:** `Action Required: Tallyfy Task '[Task Name]' outcome was '[Approval Outcome]'`.
    *   **Body:** `Please review Tallyfy task [Task Name]. Outcome: [Approval Outcome].`

6.  **Save and test your flow.** (See [managing and monitoring flows](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/managing-and-monitoring-power-automate-flows/) for testing tips).

</Steps>

## Handling multiple conditions (AND/OR) for Tallyfy data

Often, you'll need to check more than one Tallyfy data point.

*   **Adding rows:** Inside a Condition, click **+ Add** > **Add row**.
*   **AND logic:** Default for multiple rows; all conditions must be true.
*   **OR logic:** Change the operator at the top of the conditions group to OR; any condition being true suffices.

*Tallyfy Example (AND):* IF Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) Priority ([form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/)) is "High" **AND** its Due Date (from Tallyfy) is in the past, THEN send an escalation alert.

## Nested conditions for complex Tallyfy logic

You can place a Condition control inside another Condition's branch for more complex decision trees based on Tallyfy data.

*Example:* First, check IF Tallyfy [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) type is "Sales Order." IF YES, *then* use a nested condition to check IF the order value (a Tallyfy [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/)) is greater than $10,000.

If logic becomes too convoluted, consider using a Switch control (see [advanced conditions and expressions](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/advanced-conditions-and-expressions/)).

## Introduction to Switch control (for multiple distinct options from Tallyfy)

When evaluating a single Tallyfy value against many distinct options, the **Switch** control is cleaner than multiple nested conditions. This is detailed further in our article on [advanced conditions and expressions](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/advanced-conditions-and-expressions/).

*   **Structure:** Provide a value to switch ON (e.g., dynamic content from a Tallyfy [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/)). Define multiple **CASE** branches, each for a specific value from Tallyfy. A **DEFAULT** branch handles non-matching values.

*Tallyfy Example:* A Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) has a [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) "Support Ticket Category" with values like "Billing Issue," "Technical Problem."
    *   SWITCH ON Tallyfy "Support Ticket Category":
        *   CASE "Billing Issue": Action - Notify finance.
        *   CASE "Technical Problem": Action - Create urgent [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in a Tallyfy "Tech Support" [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).
        *   DEFAULT: Action - Notify general support.

## Tips for using conditions with Tallyfy data

*   **Data types:** Ensure data types match. Use [expressions](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/advanced-conditions-and-expressions/) (like `int()`) to convert Tallyfy text field values if comparing to numbers.
*   **Case sensitivity:** Use expressions like `toLower()` for case-insensitive text comparisons of Tallyfy data.
*   **Leverage Tallyfy outputs:** Use data from Tallyfy [connector](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/) triggers and actions to drive your conditional logic.
*   **Test all paths:** Thoroughly test every branch with different Tallyfy data inputs.
