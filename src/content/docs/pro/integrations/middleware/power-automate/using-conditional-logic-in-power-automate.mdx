title: Using conditional logic in Power Automate
---

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Conditional logic makes your Power Automate flows smart. Instead of running the same actions every time, your flow checks Tallyfy data and picks a different path based on what it finds -- sending escalation emails for high-priority [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), routing approvals to different teams, or skipping steps entirely when they don't apply.

## How conditional logic works with Tallyfy

Your flow asks a yes-or-no question about Tallyfy data, then takes one path if true, another if false. A customer support [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) is a good example -- the flow checks a "Priority" [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) on each [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/). High priority gets escalated immediately. Low priority gets logged for routine follow-up.

## The Condition control

<Steps>

1.  **Add a condition** -- click **+ New step**, search for `Condition`, and select it from Controls.

2.  **Structure** -- the Condition control gives you three sections:
    *   **IF:** Your condition based on Tallyfy data.
    *   **IF YES (THEN):** Actions that run when the condition is true.
    *   **IF NO (ELSE):** Actions that run when it's false.

3.  **Define the condition:**
    *   **Value 1:** Pick dynamic content from a Tallyfy [connector](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/) action (like the output of **Get User Tasks**) or type a static value.
    *   **Operator:** Choose a comparison -- `is equal to`, `contains`, `is greater than`, `starts with`, `is empty`, and their opposites.
    *   **Value 2:** The value you're comparing against (dynamic content or static).

</Steps>

## Building a conditional flow with Tallyfy

Here's a practical scenario: you've set up a Tallyfy webhook[^1] that fires when someone completes a task. Your Power Automate flow receives that webhook data, then sends different email notifications based on the task's priority level.

<Steps>

1.  **Trigger: "When an HTTP request is received."**
    *   Start a new automated [cloud flow](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/understanding-power-automate-basics/).
    *   Use the **When an HTTP request is received** trigger, then paste the generated URL into your Tallyfy webhook configuration.
    *   The webhook payload from Tallyfy includes task details and [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) values.

2.  **Action: Tallyfy - "Get User Tasks" (optional).**
    If you need additional [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) data beyond what the webhook provides, add the Tallyfy connector's **Get User Tasks** action to pull more details.

3.  **Control: "Condition".**
    Add a Condition control.
    *   **Value 1:** Select the priority field from the webhook body or Tallyfy action output.
    *   **Operator:** Select `is equal to`.
    *   **Value 2:** Type `High`.

4.  **IF YES branch:**
    When priority equals "High":
    *   Add action: **Send an email (V2)**.
    *   **To:** Manager or escalation contact.
    *   **Subject:** `Urgent: Tallyfy task '[Task Name]' needs attention`.
    *   **Body:** Include the task details and a link to the Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/).

5.  **IF NO branch:**
    When priority isn't "High":
    *   Add action: **Send an email (V2)**.
    *   **To:** The assigned team member.
    *   **Subject:** `Tallyfy task '[Task Name]' completed - routine follow-up`.
    *   **Body:** Summary of the task and next steps.

6.  **Save and test your flow.** (See [managing and monitoring flows](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/managing-and-monitoring-power-automate-flows/) for testing tips.)

</Steps>

## Visualizing the conditional flow

```d2
direction: down

# Start
Trigger: Task Completed {
  style.fill: "#f2faf4"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

# Actions
GetDetails: Get Task Details {
  style.fill: "#e1f7e6"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

EmailManager: Email Manager {
  style.fill: "#e1f7e6"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

EmailRegular: Email Team {
  style.fill: "#e1f7e6"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

# Decision
Check: Priority = High? {
  shape: diamond
  style.fill: "#f2faf4"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

# End
End: Continue Process {
  shape: circle
  style.fill: "#e1f7e6"
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}

# Flow connections
Trigger -> GetDetails {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}
GetDetails -> Check {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}
Check -> EmailManager: Yes {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}
Check -> EmailRegular: No {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}
EmailManager -> End {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}
EmailRegular -> End {
  style.stroke: "#225930"
}
```

The diamond is the decision point. Two paths branch from it -- each leading to a different email action based on the form field value.

## Multiple conditions with AND/OR

You'll often need to check more than one piece of Tallyfy data at once.

*   **Adding rows:** Inside a Condition, click **+ Add** > **Add row**.
*   **AND logic:** The default -- all conditions must be true.
*   **OR logic:** Switch the operator at the top to OR -- any single true condition is enough.

*Example (AND):* IF a Tallyfy [task's](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) Priority [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) is "High" **AND** its deadline has passed, THEN send an escalation alert.

## Nested conditions

Need more complex decision trees? Place a Condition control inside another Condition's branch.

*Example:* First, check if the Tallyfy [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) type is "Sales Order." If yes, nest another condition to check whether the order value ([form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/)) exceeds $10,000.

When nesting gets messy, switch to a Switch control instead (see [advanced conditions and expressions](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/advanced-conditions-and-expressions/)).

## Switch control for multiple options

The **Switch** control works better than nested conditions when you're checking one Tallyfy value against several options. More detail in our [advanced conditions and expressions](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/advanced-conditions-and-expressions/) article.

*   **Structure:** Pick a value to switch on (like a Tallyfy [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/)). Create multiple **CASE** branches for each possible value. The **DEFAULT** branch catches everything else.

*Example:* A Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) has a "Support Ticket Category" [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) with values like "Billing Issue" and "Technical Problem."
*   SWITCH ON "Support Ticket Category":
    *   CASE "Billing Issue": Notify finance.
    *   CASE "Technical Problem": Create an urgent [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in a Tallyfy "Tech Support" [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).
    *   DEFAULT: Notify general support.

## Tips for conditions with Tallyfy data

*   **Match data types** -- use [expressions](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/advanced-conditions-and-expressions/) like `int()` to convert Tallyfy text values when comparing against numbers.
*   **Handle case sensitivity** -- wrap text in `toLower()` for case-insensitive comparisons.
*   **Use Tallyfy connector outputs** -- data from Tallyfy [connector](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/) actions should drive your conditional logic.
*   **Test every branch** -- run through each path with different Tallyfy data inputs to catch edge cases.
