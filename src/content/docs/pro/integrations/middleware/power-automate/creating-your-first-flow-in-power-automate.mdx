## How do I create my first Power Automate flow for Tallyfy?

Building your initial automated workflow in Power Automate for Tallyfy integration provides straightforward entry into workflow automation.

This guide demonstrates how to create practical flows that connect external events (such as emails) to Tallyfy actions, showing common automation patterns that enhance workflow efficiency and reduce manual intervention.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have:

*   **Microsoft Power Automate access:** A license allowing flow creation. Many Microsoft 365 subscriptions include this.
*   **A Tallyfy Pro account:** Recommended for using the Tallyfy [connector](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/) and interacting with Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) and [procedure templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).
*   **A clear goal for Tallyfy integration:** Understand what you want to automate with Tallyfy.

### What scenario will this Power Automate flow accomplish?

This tutorial creates a Power Automate flow that monitors Outlook 365 inbox activity for automated Tallyfy task creation.

When emails containing specific subjects (e.g., "New Sales Lead Received") arrive, the flow automatically generates new [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) within designated Tallyfy "Lead Follow-Up" [procedure templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), ensuring immediate workflow initiation without manual intervention.

This showcases a common integration pattern where an external event triggers an action in Tallyfy, ensuring important items are captured within your Tallyfy workflows.

## Steps to create your first automated flow for Tallyfy

<Steps>

1.  **Navigate to Power Automate and start a new flow.**
    Go to [flow.microsoft.com](https://flow.microsoft.com). Sign in. From the left menu, select **+ Create** > **Automated cloud flow** (see [understanding Power Automate basics](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/understanding-power-automate-basics/) for flow types).

2.  **Name your flow and choose a trigger.**
    In the "Build an automated cloud flow" dialog:
    *   **Flow name:** `New Sales Lead Email to Tallyfy Task`.
    *   Search trigger: `When a new email arrives`.
    *   Select **When a new email arrives (V3)** (Outlook 365). Click **Create**.



3.  **Configure the email trigger.**
    The flow designer will open with the email trigger. Click on the trigger step to expand its options:
    *   **Folder:** Select the mail folder you want to monitor (e.g., `Inbox`).
    *   Click **Show advanced options**.
    *   **Subject Filter:** Enter the specific subject line Power Automate should look for, e.g., `New Sales Lead Received`. This ensures the flow only runs for relevant emails.
    *   You can also set other filters like "From" or "Importance" if needed.



4.  **Add the Tallyfy action: Create a task.**
    Click **+ New step**. Search `Tallyfy` and select the Tallyfy [connector](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/). Choose **Create a task**.

    :::note[Tallyfy Connection]
    If this is your first time, you'll be prompted to create a Tallyfy connection. You'll need your Tallyfy Organization ID, an API Key, and an API Secret. Generate API keys in Tallyfy [organization settings](/products/pro/settings/org-settings/) (API section). Refer to Tallyfy's documentation on [API access](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) and [how to integrate Tallyfy with Power Automate](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/) for details.
    :::

5.  **Configure the Tallyfy "Create a task" action.**
    Once connected, configure the Tallyfy action fields:
    *   **Blueprint ID:** Select the Tallyfy [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) for the new task (e.g., "Lead Follow-Up Process").
    *   **Run ID (Optional):** If adding to an *existing, active* Tallyfy [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), provide its Run ID. For a new process instance, leave blank if the task is initial or you intend to launch a new process run containing this task.
        *   *Tallyfy Tip:* For a brand new lead from an email, typically use the "Launch process" Tallyfy action to start a new instance of your "Lead Follow-Up Process" [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), mapping email details to launch [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/). For this example, we assume adding to an existing process if you had its Run ID.
    *   **Step Position (Optional):** If adding to an existing Tallyfy process with a Run ID, specify step position.
    *   **Task Name:** Use dynamic content. Select **Subject** from the email trigger. Prepend text if desired, e.g., `New Lead: [Subject]`.
    *   **Task Description:** Select **Body** from email trigger dynamic content to populate the Tallyfy task description.
    *   **Assigned To Email (Optional):** Hardcode an email or use dynamic content.
    *   **Deadline (Optional):** Set a deadline. For one day from now, use an [expression](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/advanced-conditions-and-expressions/): `addDays(utcNow(), 1)`.



6.  **Save your flow.** Refer to [managing and monitoring flows](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/managing-and-monitoring-power-automate-flows/) for saving and testing tips.

</Steps>

## Understanding the flow designer UI for Tallyfy integration

The Power Automate flow designer is where you build workflows that interact with Tallyfy:
*   **Triggers and Actions:** Building blocks for your Tallyfy integration.
*   **Dynamic Content Pane:** Select outputs from previous steps (like email subject) to use in Tallyfy actions.
*   **Expression Editor:** Write formulas for advanced data manipulation for Tallyfy fields. (See [advanced conditions and expressions](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/advanced-conditions-and-expressions/)).
*   **Save, Test, Flow Checker:** Buttons for managing your Tallyfy-integrated flow.

## Testing your Tallyfy-integrated flow

Testing is crucial.

<Steps>

1.  **Open the Test pane.**
    With your flow saved, click **Test**.

2.  **Perform a manual test.**
    Select **Manually**, then **Test**. Power Automate waits for you to trigger the flow (send an email).

3.  **Trigger the flow.**
    Send an email to the monitored inbox with the specified subject (e.g., "New Sales Lead Received").

4.  **Check the flow run history.**
    Power Automate shows the run. Green checkmark for success. Red exclamation for failure; click the failed step for error details. (See [managing and monitoring flows](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/managing-and-monitoring-power-automate-flows/)).



5.  **Verify in Tallyfy.**
    Log into Tallyfy. Check the specified [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) or [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) to confirm the new [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) was created with email details.

</Steps>

## Tips for creating flows with Tallyfy

*   This flow pattern ensures email requests are captured in your Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).
*   Explore other Tallyfy [connector](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/) actions: **Launch process** (often better for new items), **Update task**, or **Get task details**.
*   Consider other email-driven tasks that could feed into your Tallyfy workflows.
*   For advanced scenarios not covered by the connector, use Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/).
