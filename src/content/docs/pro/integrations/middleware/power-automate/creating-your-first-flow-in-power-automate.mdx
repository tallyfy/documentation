## Create your first Power Automate flow

You can connect Power Automate to Tallyfy in about 10 minutes. This guide walks you through building a flow that creates Tallyfy tasks whenever you get specific emails.

Why email-to-task? It's practical, you'll use it right away, and it teaches the basics for more advanced integrations.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

*   **Microsoft Power Automate access** -- most Microsoft 365 subscriptions include this.
*   **A Tallyfy Pro account** -- you'll connect it through the Tallyfy [connector](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/) to work with [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) and [procedure templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).

### What does this flow do?

We're building a flow that watches your Outlook inbox for emails with "New Sales Lead Received" in the subject line. When one arrives, it creates a task in Tallyfy.

No more copy-pasting from emails. No forgotten leads. The flow catches every matching email and turns it into a trackable [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) with the email subject and body content.

## How the flow works

Here's the full path from email arrival to task creation in Tallyfy.

PA -> PA: 12. Complete {

}
```

### What to notice

- **Step 4** -- only emails with "New Sales Lead Received" trigger the flow, so you won't create tasks from every email
- **Steps 6-7** -- the connector authenticates via OAuth2 using your Tallyfy Organization ID to connect Power Automate securely
- **Step 10** -- confirms the task was created in Tallyfy with the email content mapped in

## Steps to create the flow

<Steps>

1.  **Go to Power Automate and start a new flow.**
    Head to [flow.microsoft.com](https://flow.microsoft.com) and sign in. From the left menu, pick **+ Create** > **Automated cloud flow** (see [understanding Power Automate basics](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/understanding-power-automate-basics/) for flow types).

2.  **Name your flow and choose a trigger.**
    In the "Build an automated cloud flow" dialog:
    *   **Flow name:** `New Sales Lead Email to Tallyfy Task`.
    *   Search for: `When a new email arrives`.
    *   Select **When a new email arrives (V3)** (Outlook 365). Click **Create**.

3.  **Configure the email trigger.**
    Click the trigger step to expand it:
    *   **Folder:** Pick the folder to monitor (usually `Inbox`).
    *   Click **Show advanced options**.
    *   **Subject Filter:** Type what the subject must contain -- for example, `New Sales Lead Received`. This prevents the flow from firing on every email.
    *   You can also filter by sender or importance if needed.

4.  **Add the Tallyfy action: Create a task.**
    Click **+ New step**. Search `Tallyfy` and select the Tallyfy [connector](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/). Choose **Create a task**.

    :::note[Tallyfy connection]
    First time connecting? You'll sign in via OAuth2 and provide your Tallyfy Organization ID. The connector handles authentication from there. Check the [connector setup guide](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/) if you get stuck.
    :::

5.  **Configure the "Create a task" action.**
    Once connected, fill in the Tallyfy action fields:
    *   **Task Name:** Use dynamic content -- select **Subject** from the email trigger. Prepend text if you want, e.g., `New Lead: [Subject]`.
    *   **Task Description:** Select **Body** from the email trigger to populate the task description.
    *   **Assigned To (Optional):** Pick users or guests to assign the task to.
    *   **Deadline (Optional):** Set a deadline. For one day from now, use an [expression](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/advanced-conditions-and-expressions/): `addDays(utcNow(), 1)`.

    *Tip:* For brand new leads, you might prefer the **Launch a Process** action instead -- it starts a fresh instance of a [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) and lets you map email details to [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/).

6.  **Save your flow.** See [managing and monitoring flows](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/managing-and-monitoring-power-automate-flows/) for saving and testing tips.

</Steps>

## The flow designer UI

You'll spend most of your time in the flow designer. Here's what matters:

*   **Triggers and actions** -- triggers start the flow, actions do the work.
*   **Dynamic content pane** -- shows data from previous steps (like the email subject) that you can drop into Tallyfy fields.
*   **Expression editor** -- for date math and text manipulation. (See [advanced conditions and expressions](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/advanced-conditions-and-expressions/)).
*   **Save, Test, Flow Checker** -- save often, test everything.

## Testing your flow

Make sure it works before you rely on it.

<Steps>

1.  **Open the Test pane.**
    With your flow saved, click **Test**.

2.  **Run a manual test.**
    Select **Manually**, then **Test**. Power Automate waits for you to trigger the flow.

3.  **Trigger the flow.**
    Send an email to the monitored inbox with the subject line (e.g., "New Sales Lead Received").

4.  **Check flow run history.**
    Green checkmark means success. Red exclamation means something failed -- click the step to see details. (More in [managing and monitoring flows](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/managing-and-monitoring-power-automate-flows/)).

5.  **Verify in Tallyfy.**
    Log into Tallyfy and confirm the new [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) was created with the email details.

</Steps>

## Tips for Tallyfy flows

*   This email-to-task pattern captures every important request in your Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) so nothing slips through.
*   The Tallyfy [connector](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/) has other actions too -- **Launch a Process**, **Complete task**, **Edit task deadline**, **Add comment**, and more.
*   Think about other emails that trigger work. Support tickets? Purchase orders? They can all flow into Tallyfy automatically.
*   Need something the connector doesn't cover? Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) handles advanced use cases.
