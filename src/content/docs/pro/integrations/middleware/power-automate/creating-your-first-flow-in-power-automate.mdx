title: Creating your first flow in Power Automate
---

Building your first automated workflow in Power Automate to integrate with Tallyfy can be straightforward. This guide walks you through creating a practical flow that connects an external event (an email) to an action in Tallyfy, demonstrating a common automation pattern for Tallyfy users.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have:

*   **Microsoft Power Automate access:** A license allowing flow creation. Many Microsoft 365 subscriptions include this.
*   **A Tallyfy Pro account:** Recommended for using the Tallyfy [connector](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/) and interacting with Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) and [procedure templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).
*   **A clear goal for Tallyfy integration:** Understand what you want to automate with Tallyfy.

## Scenario: automatically create a Tallyfy task from an email

Our goal is to create a Power Automate flow that monitors an Outlook 365 inbox. When an email with a specific subject (e.g., "New Sales Lead Received") arrives, the flow automatically creates a new [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in a designated Tallyfy "Lead Follow-Up" [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).

This showcases a common integration: an external event triggers an action in Tallyfy, ensuring important items are captured within your Tallyfy workflows.

## Steps to create your first automated flow for Tallyfy

<Steps>

1.  **Navigate to Power Automate and start a new flow.**
    Go to [flow.microsoft.com](https://flow.microsoft.com). Sign in. From the left menu, select **+ Create** > **Automated cloud flow** (see [understanding Power Automate basics](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/understanding-power-automate-basics/) for flow types).

2.  **Name your flow and choose a trigger.**
    In the "Build an automated cloud flow" dialog:
    *   **Flow name:** `New Sales Lead Email to Tallyfy Task`.
    *   Search trigger: `When a new email arrives`.
    *   Select **When a new email arrives (V3)** (Outlook 365). Click **Create**.

3.  **Configure the email trigger.**
    The flow designer will open with the email trigger. Click on the trigger step to expand its options:
    *   **Folder:** Select the mail folder you want to monitor (e.g., `Inbox`).
    *   Click **Show advanced options**.
    *   **Subject Filter:** Enter the specific subject line Power Automate should look for, e.g., `New Sales Lead Received`. This ensures the flow only runs for relevant emails.
    *   You can also set other filters like "From" or "Importance" if needed.

4.  **Add the Tallyfy action: Create a task.**
    Click **+ New step**. Search `Tallyfy` and select the Tallyfy [connector](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/). Choose **Create a task**.

    :::note[Tallyfy Connection]
    If this is your first time, you'll be prompted to create a Tallyfy connection. You'll need your Tallyfy Organization ID, an API Key, and an API Secret. Generate API keys in Tallyfy [organization settings](/products/pro/settings/org-settings/) (API section). Refer to Tallyfy's documentation on [API access](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) and [how to integrate Tallyfy with Power Automate](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/) for details.
    :::

5.  **Configure the Tallyfy "Create a task" action.**
    Once connected, configure the Tallyfy action fields:
    *   **Blueprint ID:** Select the Tallyfy [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) for the new task (e.g., "Lead Follow-Up Process").
    *   **Run ID (Optional):** If adding to an *existing, active* Tallyfy [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), provide its Run ID. For a new process instance, leave blank if the task is initial or you intend to launch a new process run containing this task.
        *   *Tallyfy Tip:* For a brand new lead from an email, typically use the "Launch process" Tallyfy action to start a new instance of your "Lead Follow-Up Process" [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), mapping email details to launch [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/). For this example, we assume adding to an existing process if you had its Run ID.
    *   **Step Position (Optional):** If adding to an existing Tallyfy process with a Run ID, specify step position.
    *   **Task Name:** Use dynamic content. Select **Subject** from the email trigger. Prepend text if desired, e.g., `New Lead: [Subject]`.
    *   **Task Description:** Select **Body** from email trigger dynamic content to populate the Tallyfy task description.
    *   **Assigned To Email (Optional):** Hardcode an email or use dynamic content.
    *   **Deadline (Optional):** Set a deadline. For one day from now, use an [expression](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/advanced-conditions-and-expressions/): `addDays(utcNow(), 1)`.

6.  **Save your flow.** Refer to [managing and monitoring flows](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/managing-and-monitoring-power-automate-flows/) for saving and testing tips.

</Steps>

## Understanding the flow designer UI for Tallyfy integration

The Power Automate flow designer is where you build workflows that interact with Tallyfy:
*   **Triggers and Actions:** Building blocks for your Tallyfy integration.
*   **Dynamic Content Pane:** Select outputs from previous steps (like email subject) to use in Tallyfy actions.
*   **Expression Editor:** Write formulas for advanced data manipulation for Tallyfy fields. (See [advanced conditions and expressions](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/advanced-conditions-and-expressions/)).
*   **Save, Test, Flow Checker:** Buttons for managing your Tallyfy-integrated flow.

## Testing your Tallyfy-integrated flow

Testing is crucial.

<Steps>

1.  **Open the Test pane.**
    With your flow saved, click **Test**.

2.  **Perform a manual test.**
    Select **Manually**, then **Test**. Power Automate waits for you to trigger the flow (send an email).

3.  **Trigger the flow.**
    Send an email to the monitored inbox with the specified subject (e.g., "New Sales Lead Received").

4.  **Check the flow run history.**
    Power Automate shows the run. Green checkmark for success. Red exclamation for failure; click the failed step for error details. (See [managing and monitoring flows](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/managing-and-monitoring-power-automate-flows/)).

    ![Screenshot of flow run history in Power Automate](mdc:/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/assets/flow-run-history.png)

5.  **Verify in Tallyfy.**
    Log into Tallyfy. Check the specified [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) or [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) to confirm the new [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) was created with email details.

</Steps>

## Tips for Tallyfy users creating flows

*   This flow ensures email requests are captured in your Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).
*   Explore other Tallyfy [connector](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/) actions: **Launch process** (often better for new items), **Update task**, or **Get task details**.
*   Consider other email-driven tasks that could feed into your Tallyfy workflows.
*   For advanced scenarios not covered by the connector, use Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/).
