## How do I create my first Power Automate flow for Tallyfy?

You can connect Power Automate to Tallyfy in about 10 minutes - and this guide shows you exactly how. We'll build a real flow that automatically creates Tallyfy tasks whenever you receive specific emails.

Why start with email-to-task automation? It's practical, you'll use it immediately, and it teaches the fundamentals you need for more complex integrations.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have:

*   **Microsoft Power Automate access:** You need a license that lets you create flows. Most Microsoft 365 subscriptions include this.
*   **A Tallyfy Pro account:** You'll use this with the Tallyfy [connector](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/) to work with [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) and [procedure templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).
*   **A clear goal for Tallyfy integration:** Know what you're trying to automate - it makes setup much easier.

### What scenario will this Power Automate flow accomplish?

Here's what we're building: a flow that watches your Outlook inbox for emails with "New Sales Lead Received" in the subject line. When one arrives, it instantly creates a task in your Tallyfy "Lead Follow-Up" template.

No more copying and pasting from emails. No forgotten leads. The flow catches every qualified email and turns it into an actionable [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in your [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) - complete with the email subject and body content. It just works.

## How the email-to-task automation flow works

This diagram shows the complete automation flow from email arrival to task creation in Tallyfy.

```d2
E: "Email Sender"
O: "Outlook Inbox"
PA: "Power Automate"
T: "Tallyfy API"
TP: "Tallyfy Process"

# Automated Email-to-Task Flow
E -> O: "1. Sends email with 'New Sales Lead Received'"
O -> O: "2. Email arrives in Inbox"
O -> PA: "3. Trigger: New email detected"
PA -> PA: "4. Check subject filter"

# Subject matches filter
MatchPath: "Subject Matches" {
  PA -> PA: "5. Extract email data (Subject, Body, Sender)"
  PA -> T: "6. POST Create Task Auth: API Key/Secret"
  # Blueprint ID: Lead Follow-Up Task Name: Email Subject Description: Email Body Deadline: +1 day
  T -> T: "7. Validate request"
  T -> TP: "8. Create task in process"
  TP -> T: "9. Task created (ID: xxx)"
  T -> PA: "10. 200 OK - Task created"
  PA -> PA: "11. Log success"
}

NoMatchPath: "Subject Doesn't Match" {
  PA -> PA: "12. Skip (no action)"
}

# Task now trackable in Tallyfy
```

### What to notice

- **Step 4** shows the subject filter check - only emails with "New Sales Lead Received" trigger the flow, preventing accidental task creation from every email
- **Steps 6-7** demonstrate the API authentication using your Organization ID, API Key, and API Secret to securely connect Power Automate to Tallyfy
- **Step 10** confirms task creation in Tallyfy - the email content becomes a trackable task with automatic deadline setting (+1 day)

## Steps to create your first automated flow for Tallyfy

<Steps>

1.  **Navigate to Power Automate and start a new flow.**
    Go to [flow.microsoft.com](https://flow.microsoft.com). Sign in. From the left menu, select **+ Create** > **Automated cloud flow** (see [understanding Power Automate basics](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/understanding-power-automate-basics/) for flow types).

2.  **Name your flow and choose a trigger.**
    In the "Build an automated cloud flow" dialog:
    *   **Flow name:** `New Sales Lead Email to Tallyfy Task`.
    *   Search trigger: `When a new email arrives`.
    *   Select **When a new email arrives (V3)** (Outlook 365). Click **Create**.



3.  **Configure the email trigger.**
    The flow designer opens with the email trigger. Click the trigger step to expand it:
    *   **Folder:** Pick the folder to monitor (usually `Inbox`).
    *   Click **Show advanced options**.
    *   **Subject Filter:** Type exactly what the subject line should contain - for example, `New Sales Lead Received`. This stops the flow from running on every single email (trust me, you don't want that).
    *   You can filter by sender or importance too if needed.



4.  **Add the Tallyfy action: Create a task.**
    Click **+ New step**. Search `Tallyfy` and select the Tallyfy [connector](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/). Choose **Create a task**.

    :::note[Tallyfy Connection]
    First time? You'll need three things: your Tallyfy Organization ID, an API Key, and an API Secret. Generate API keys in Tallyfy [organization settings](/products/pro/settings/org-settings/) (API section). Check out the [API access](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) guide if you get stuck.
    :::

5.  **Configure the Tallyfy "Create a task" action.**
    Once connected, configure the Tallyfy action fields:
    *   **Blueprint ID:** Select the Tallyfy [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) for the new task (e.g., "Lead Follow-Up Process").
    *   **Run ID (Optional):** If adding to an *existing, active* Tallyfy [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), provide its Run ID. For a new process instance, leave blank if the task is initial or you intend to launch a new process run containing this task.
        *   *Tallyfy Tip:* For a brand new lead from an email, you'd typically use the "Launch process" action instead - it starts a fresh instance of your "Lead Follow-Up Process" [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) and maps email details to launch [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/). We're keeping it simple here by adding to an existing process.
    *   **Step Position (Optional):** If adding to an existing Tallyfy process with a Run ID, specify step position.
    *   **Task Name:** Use dynamic content. Select **Subject** from the email trigger. Prepend text if desired, e.g., `New Lead: [Subject]`.
    *   **Task Description:** Select **Body** from email trigger dynamic content to populate the Tallyfy task description.
    *   **Assigned To Email (Optional):** Hardcode an email or use dynamic content.
    *   **Deadline (Optional):** Set a deadline. For one day from now, use an [expression](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/advanced-conditions-and-expressions/): `addDays(utcNow(), 1)`.



6.  **Save your flow.** Refer to [managing and monitoring flows](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/managing-and-monitoring-power-automate-flows/) for saving and testing tips.

</Steps>

## Understanding the flow designer UI for Tallyfy integration

The Power Automate flow designer is where you'll spend most of your time. Here's what matters:
*   **Triggers and Actions:** These are your building blocks - triggers start the flow, actions do the work.
*   **Dynamic Content Pane:** This shows data from previous steps (like the email subject) that you can drop into Tallyfy fields.
*   **Expression Editor:** For date calculations and text manipulation. (See [advanced conditions and expressions](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/advanced-conditions-and-expressions/)).
*   **Save, Test, Flow Checker:** Your control panel - save often, test everything.

## Testing your Tallyfy-integrated flow

Let's make sure everything works before you rely on it.

<Steps>

1.  **Open the Test pane.**
    With your flow saved, click **Test**.

2.  **Perform a manual test.**
    Select **Manually**, then **Test**. Power Automate waits for you to trigger the flow (send an email).

3.  **Trigger the flow.**
    Send an email to the monitored inbox with the specified subject (e.g., "New Sales Lead Received").

4.  **Check the flow run history.**
    Power Automate shows you the results. Green checkmark? Success! Red exclamation? Something went wrong - click the failed step to see what happened. (More details in [managing and monitoring flows](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/managing-and-monitoring-power-automate-flows/)).



5.  **Verify in Tallyfy.**
    Log into Tallyfy. Check the specified [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) or [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) to confirm the new [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) was created with email details.

</Steps>

## Tips for creating flows with Tallyfy

*   This email-to-task pattern captures every important request in your Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) - nothing falls through the cracks.
*   The Tallyfy [connector](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/) has other actions too: **Launch process** (better for starting fresh processes), **Update task**, and **Get task details**.
*   Think about other emails that trigger work in your organization. Support tickets? Purchase orders? They can all flow into Tallyfy automatically.
*   Need something the connector doesn't do? Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) handles the advanced stuff.
