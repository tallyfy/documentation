## What are the Power Automate basics for Tallyfy integration?

Microsoft Power Automate connects Tallyfy with the other business apps you use every day. It's a workflow automation tool that makes these connections seamless.

What does Power Automate do best? File syncing, sending notifications, collecting data, and automating those repetitive tasks that eat up your time. It streamlines how your tools work with Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) - and you'll spend way less time on manual work.

Think of Power Automate as a tool that responds to triggers - an event that starts an automation - and then performs a series of actions. Here's a real example: when a client email arrives with a contract attachment, Power Automate automatically saves that file to SharePoint and creates a Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) for your legal team to review it.

Tallyfy remains your go-to platform for managing [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) and making sure people complete their tasks. Power Automate handles the automation *around* those processes - connecting Tallyfy to the other systems you can't live without.

### Why should I integrate Power Automate with Tallyfy?

Tallyfy and Power Automate work incredibly well together. Let me explain why.

Tallyfy focuses on what it does best: helping people work through structured [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) together. You define the steps, track progress, and collaborate smoothly. Power Automate picks up the system-to-system work - those repetitive micro-tasks that happen before, during, or after your Tallyfy workflows.

When you combine them? That's when things get efficient. Tallyfy handles the human side, Power Automate handles the automation side.

Here's what this looks like in practice:

*   **Trigger Tallyfy workflows from external events:** When a new lead is added to your CRM (like Salesforce or HubSpot), a Power Automate flow can automatically launch a specific Tallyfy [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), such as "New Client Onboarding," ensuring a standardized follow-up within Tallyfy.
*   **Update external systems based on Tallyfy progress:** When a critical [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in a Tallyfy process, like "Invoice Approved," is completed, Power Automate can update your accounting software (e.g., QuickBooks, Xero).
*   **Enhance notifications:** While Tallyfy has its own robust notifications, Power Automate can extend these. For example, send an SMS to a field technician when an urgent Tallyfy task is assigned to them, or post a custom message to a specific Microsoft Teams channel based on a Tallyfy event.

To make all this happen, Tallyfy has a dedicated [connector for Power Automate](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/). You can also check out the [Tallyfy Connector page on Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/tallyfy/) (though you'll find more practical guidance right here in our docs).

## Core Power Automate terminology for Tallyfy users

You'll need to know these Power Automate terms to make the most of your Tallyfy integration:

*   **Flows:** This is the core of Power Automate. A flow is an automated workflow composed of a trigger and one or more actions, often interacting with Tallyfy.
    *   **Cloud Flows:** These are common and run in Microsoft's cloud infrastructure.
        *   *Automated flows:* These start automatically when a specific event occurs. For example, if a Tallyfy [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) step involves saving a document to a designated SharePoint folder, an automated flow can trigger when that new file is created.
        *   *Instant flows (Button flows):* These are initiated manually by a user, typically by clicking a button. For instance, a sales representative could use an instant flow to quickly launch a Tallyfy "Client Demo Request" [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). You can learn more about [triggering flows manually](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/triggering-flows-manually-button-flows/).
        *   *Scheduled flows:* These run at predetermined times. An example could be a scheduled flow that runs every morning to check for overdue Tallyfy [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) and sends a summary report to a manager.
    *   **Desktop Flows (Briefly):** These are used for Robotic Process Automation (RPA), allowing you to automate tasks on a Windows desktop. This is covered in more detail in our article on [RPA with Power Automate](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/introduction-to-rpa-with-power-automate/).
*   **Connectors:** These are bridges that allow Power Automate to communicate with different applications, including the [Tallyfy connector](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/) which is essential for integrating with your Tallyfy account. Other connectors exist for Microsoft services (Outlook, SharePoint) and third-party services.
*   **Triggers:** A trigger is the specific event that starts a flow. Examples include "When a new email arrives" (Outlook connector), "When a file is created in a folder" (SharePoint connector), or "When a Tallyfy task is completed" (using the Tallyfy connector). You can also use Tallyfy [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) in conjunction with Power Automate's HTTP connector to trigger flows based on a wide array of events in Tallyfy.
*   **Actions:** These are the operations a flow performs after it's triggered. For Tallyfy, actions could include "Create a Tallyfy task," or interacting with other systems based on Tallyfy data.
*   **Conditions:** These allow your flows to make decisions based on data, including data from Tallyfy. This is covered in [using conditional logic in Power Automate](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/using-conditional-logic-in-power-automate/).
*   **Expressions (Briefly):** These are formulas for more advanced data manipulation. We explore expressions in [advanced conditions and expressions in Power Automate](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/advanced-conditions-and-expressions/).
*   **Dynamic Content:** This refers to data from previous steps in your flow (from Tallyfy triggers or other actions) that you can use in subsequent actions. For example, when a Tallyfy task completion triggers a flow, the task's details (ID, name, completed by) are available as dynamic content.

## Power Automate interfaces overview

You'll primarily interact with Power Automate through these interfaces when setting up integrations for Tallyfy:

*   **Web Portal (flow.microsoft.com):** The main hub for creating, managing, and [monitoring your cloud flows](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/managing-and-monitoring-power-automate-flows/) that connect to Tallyfy.
*   **Mobile App (iOS and Android):** Useful for running instant (button) flows that might interact with Tallyfy.
*   **Power Automate Desktop:** This application is for creating and managing [desktop flows (RPA)](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/introduction-to-rpa-with-power-automate/).

## How these concepts enhance Tallyfy

Once you understand these building blocks, you can create automations that seriously enhance your Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).

Want a concrete example? An **automated flow** monitors your support inbox using Outlook's **connector**. The **trigger** fires when a new email arrives. If the subject line contains "Urgent Support Request" (that's your **condition**), the flow takes **action** - it uses the Tallyfy **connector** to create a high-priority [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in your support [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). The task automatically includes **dynamic content** from the email - who sent it, what they wrote, everything your team needs.

Master these basics, and you'll connect Tallyfy to your entire digital ecosystem. Power Automate becomes the bridge that makes it all work together.
