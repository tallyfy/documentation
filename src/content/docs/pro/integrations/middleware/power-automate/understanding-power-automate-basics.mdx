## What are the Power Automate basics for Tallyfy integration?

Power Automate connects Tallyfy with the other business apps you use daily. It handles file syncing, notifications, data collection, and repetitive tasks - so your tools work smoothly with Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) and you spend less time on manual work.

Here's a quick example: when a client email arrives with a contract attachment, Power Automate saves that file to SharePoint and creates a Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) for your legal team to review it. That's a trigger (the email arriving) followed by actions (saving the file, creating the task).

Tallyfy stays your go-to for managing [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) and making sure people complete their work. Power Automate handles the automation *around* those processes - connecting Tallyfy to the rest of your systems.

### Why should I integrate Power Automate with Tallyfy?

Tallyfy helps people work through structured [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) together - defining steps, tracking progress, and collaborating. Power Automate picks up the system-to-system work that happens before, during, or after your Tallyfy workflows. Together, Tallyfy covers the human side and Power Automate covers the automation side.

Here's what that looks like in practice:

*   **Launch Tallyfy workflows from external events:** When a new lead lands in your CRM (like Salesforce or HubSpot), a Power Automate flow can automatically launch a Tallyfy [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) such as "New Client Onboarding."
*   **Update external systems based on Tallyfy progress:** When a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) like "Invoice Approved" is completed in Tallyfy, a Power Automate flow (started by a Tallyfy [webhook](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/)) can update your accounting software (e.g., QuickBooks, Xero).
*   **Extend notifications:** Tallyfy has its own notifications, but Power Automate can go further - sending an SMS to a field technician when an urgent task is assigned, or posting to a Microsoft Teams channel based on a Tallyfy event.

Tallyfy has a dedicated [connector for Power Automate](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/) with 13 actions (like creating tasks and launching processes). It uses OAuth 2.0 authentication and is a Premium tier connector. You can also check the [Tallyfy Connector page on Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/tallyfy/).

> **Important** - The Tallyfy connector provides actions only, not triggers. To start a Power Automate flow from a Tallyfy event, use Tallyfy [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) paired with Power Automate's "When an HTTP request is received" trigger.

## Core Power Automate terminology for Tallyfy users

These are the Power Automate terms you'll need for your Tallyfy integration:

*   **Flows:** The core unit of Power Automate - an automated workflow with a trigger and one or more actions.
    *   **Cloud flows:** Run in Microsoft's cloud.
        *   *Automated flows:* Start when a specific event happens. For example, a Tallyfy [webhook](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) can fire when a task completes, triggering an automated flow via the HTTP connector.
        *   *Instant flows (button flows):* Started manually with a button click. A sales rep could use one to quickly launch a Tallyfy "Client Demo Request" [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). Learn more about [triggering flows manually](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/triggering-flows-manually-button-flows/).
        *   *Scheduled flows:* Run at set times. For example, a daily flow that checks for overdue Tallyfy [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) and sends a summary to a manager.
    *   **Desktop flows:** Used for Robotic Process Automation (RPA) on Windows desktops. See our article on [RPA with Power Automate](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/introduction-to-rpa-with-power-automate/).
*   **Connectors:** Bridges that let Power Automate talk to different apps. The [Tallyfy connector](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/) provides 13 actions for your Tallyfy account. Other connectors cover Microsoft services (Outlook, SharePoint) and third-party apps.
*   **Triggers:** The event that starts a flow. Examples: "When a new email arrives" (Outlook connector) or "When a file is created" (SharePoint connector). For Tallyfy events, you'd use Tallyfy [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) with Power Automate's HTTP request trigger - the Tallyfy connector itself doesn't include triggers.
*   **Actions:** Operations a flow performs after it's triggered. The Tallyfy connector's actions include creating tasks, launching processes, completing tasks, and adding comments.
*   **Conditions:** Let your flows make decisions based on data, including data from Tallyfy. Covered in [using conditional logic in Power Automate](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/using-conditional-logic-in-power-automate/).
*   **Expressions:** Formulas for advanced data manipulation. We cover these in [advanced conditions and expressions in Power Automate](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/advanced-conditions-and-expressions/).
*   **Dynamic content:** Data from previous steps in your flow that you can reuse. For example, when a Tallyfy webhook fires and starts a flow, the webhook payload (task ID, name, who completed it) becomes dynamic content for later steps.

## Power Automate interfaces overview

You'll work with Power Automate through three main interfaces:

*   **Web portal (make.powerautomate.com):** The main hub for creating, managing, and [monitoring cloud flows](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/managing-and-monitoring-power-automate-flows/) that connect to Tallyfy.
*   **Mobile app (iOS and Android):** Handy for running instant (button) flows that interact with Tallyfy.
*   **Power Automate Desktop:** For creating and managing [desktop flows (RPA)](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/introduction-to-rpa-with-power-automate/).

## How these concepts work together with Tallyfy

Once you understand these building blocks, you can create automations that make your Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) far more powerful.

Here's a concrete example: An **automated flow** monitors your support inbox using Outlook's **connector**. The **trigger** fires when a new email arrives. If the subject line contains "Urgent Support Request" (that's a **condition**), the flow uses the Tallyfy **connector** as an **action** to create a high-priority [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in your support [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). The task includes **dynamic content** from the email - sender, subject, body - everything your team needs.
