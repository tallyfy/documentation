## How do I manage files with Power Automate for Tallyfy workflows?

You need file management in Tallyfy - documents get created, shared, and archived constantly throughout your [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). That's reality.

Power Automate gives you the automation tools to handle these files without thinking about it. Your documents stay organized and connected to your other business systems. No more manual file shuffling. Everything stays where it should.

### Which file management connectors work best with Tallyfy?

Power Automate connects to pretty much any file storage service you're using. Here's what matters.

These [connectors](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/understanding-power-automate-basics/) work best with Tallyfy:

*   **SharePoint:** Perfect when your team collaborates on documents within Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)
*   **OneDrive for Business:** Works when individuals need their files synced with Tallyfy locations

You've got other options too - Dropbox, Google Drive, FTP. The concepts stay the same.

Want to know which triggers actually matter for Tallyfy file automation? These ones:

*   `When a file is created (properties only)` - fires when someone drops a document in your Tallyfy SharePoint library
*   `When a file is created or modified (properties only)`
*   `When a file is created in a folder`

And here are the actions you'll use constantly:

*   `Create file`
*   `Copy file`
*   `Move file`
*   `Get file content`
*   `Get file properties`
*   `Delete file`

## Use cases for file management with Tallyfy

Let's talk real scenarios where file automation makes your Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) actually work better:

*   **Archiving Tallyfy-generated documents:** Picture this - someone completes a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) and uploads their final report through a [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/). That completion fires a [webhook](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/). Power Automate catches it and automatically archives the file to SharePoint. Done.
*   **Attaching files to Tallyfy tasks automatically:** Drop a new contract in SharePoint, and Power Automate instantly creates a "Review Contract" [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in your Tallyfy "Legal Review" [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). The contract's already attached. Your lawyers get notified. It just works.
*   **Triggering Tallyfy processes from file events:** Someone saves a sales proposal to your monitored OneDrive folder? Power Automate spots it and launches your "Sales Proposal Review" [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in Tallyfy - with the file link already populated in the launch form.

## Building an example file management flow for Tallyfy

Here's a real example you can build in 10 minutes. Your "Project Completion" [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) has a final [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) where users upload their closure report PDF. You want that report automatically archived to SharePoint when they're done. Let's build it.

<Steps>

1.  **Set up the Tallyfy trigger.**
    In Power Automate, create an **Automated cloud flow** (see [understanding Power Automate basics](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/understanding-power-automate-basics/)).
    Trigger: `Tallyfy` - **When a task is completed**.
    *   Configure the Tallyfy [connection](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/).
    *   **Blueprint ID (Optional):** Select your "Project Completion" Tallyfy [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).
    *   **Step Position (Optional):** Specify the task step if known.

2.  **Get Tallyfy task details (including the file).**
    Add step: `Tallyfy` - **Get task details**.
    *   **Task ID:** Use `Task ID` dynamic content from the trigger.
    This pulls all the [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) data - including your uploaded file.



3.  **Initialize a variable to store file content (optional but good practice).**
    Tallyfy sends files as base64 - you might need to decode them. Check out [working with data operations and variables](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/working-with-data-operations-and-variables/) if you're new to this.
    Action: **Initialize variable**.
    *   **Name:** `FileContentDecoded`
    *   **Type:** `String`
    *   **Value:** Use this [expression](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/advanced-conditions-and-expressions/) if your file field is named `ProjectClosureReportFile`:
        `base64ToString(outputs('Get_task_details')?['body/forms/ProjectClosureReportFile/contentBytes'])`
        *(Skip this step if Tallyfy's connector already gives you SharePoint-ready content like `ProjectClosureReportFile_Content`)* 

4.  **Create the file in SharePoint.**
    Add step: `SharePoint` - **Create file**.
    *   **Site Address:** Pick your SharePoint site.
    *   **Folder Path:** Choose where to save it (like `/Project Archives/Completed Reports/`). Want automatic year/month folders? Use this [expression](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/advanced-conditions-and-expressions/): `/Project Archives/Completed Reports/@{formatDateTime(utcNow(),'yyyy')}/@{formatDateTime(utcNow(),'MM')}`.
    *   **File Name:** Pull from Tallyfy's dynamic content. Make it unique - something like `Project Report - [Process Name] - [Task Name].pdf`. If Tallyfy gives you a filename already (like `ProjectClosureReportFile_Name`), just use that.
    *   **File Content:** Pick your decoded variable from step 3. Or if you skipped that step, grab the file content directly from Tallyfy (like `ProjectClosureReportFile_Content`).



5.  **(Optional) Notify the team.**
    Action: **Post a message in a chat or channel** (Microsoft Teams connector).
    *   Send a quick message to your project channel: "Project Closure Report for `[Process Name]` has been archived."

6.  **Save and test your flow.**
    Go complete that Tallyfy task with a real file upload. Watch the magic happen. Need help debugging? Check [managing and monitoring flows](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/managing-and-monitoring-power-automate-flows/).

</Steps>

## Tips for effective file automation with Tallyfy

*   **Clear folder structures:** Keep your SharePoint/OneDrive organized. Trust me - it makes Power Automate setup way easier when you know exactly where Tallyfy files should go.
*   **Permissions management:** Your Power Automate connection needs the right permissions for file operations. Check this first or you'll waste 30 minutes troubleshooting.
*   **File naming conventions:** Be consistent. Stick the Tallyfy [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) or [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) ID in your filename (like `ProcessID_ReportName.pdf`). You'll thank yourself later.
*   **Leverage Tallyfy's capabilities:** Folder monitoring is fine, but Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) and [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) give you way more control. Use them.
*   **Error handling:** Files go missing. Formats get weird. Add error handling to your flows so they don't just fail silently.
