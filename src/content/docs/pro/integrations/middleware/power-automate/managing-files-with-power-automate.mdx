## Manage files with Power Automate

Documents get created, shared, and archived constantly throughout your [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). Power Automate handles the file shuffling so you don't have to - keeping documents organized and connected to your business systems automatically.

### Which file connectors work best with Tallyfy?

These [connectors](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/understanding-power-automate-basics/) pair well with Tallyfy:

*   **SharePoint** - great for team document collaboration within Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)
*   **OneDrive for Business** - works when individuals need personal files synced with Tallyfy

Dropbox, Google Drive, and FTP connectors also work. The concepts stay the same.

**SharePoint/OneDrive triggers** that matter for file automation:

*   `When a file is created (properties only)` - fires when someone drops a document into a monitored library
*   `When a file is created or modified (properties only)`
*   `When a file is created in a folder`

**SharePoint/OneDrive actions** you'll use often:

*   `Create file`, `Copy file`, `Move file`
*   `Get file content`, `Get file properties`, `Delete file`

> The Tallyfy connector itself doesn't include file-specific actions. You'll use SharePoint or OneDrive connectors for file operations, combined with Tallyfy [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) and the Tallyfy connector's task/process actions.

## Use cases for file management with Tallyfy

Here's where file automation makes your Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) genuinely better:

*   **Archiving documents on task completion** - Someone completes a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) and uploads their final report through a [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/). A Tallyfy [webhook](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) fires, Power Automate catches it, and the file gets archived to SharePoint automatically.
*   **Creating Tallyfy tasks from file events** - Drop a new contract in SharePoint, and Power Automate uses the Tallyfy connector's **Create Task** action to add a "Review Contract" [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) with the file link included.
*   **Launching processes from file uploads** - Someone saves a sales proposal to a monitored OneDrive folder. Power Automate spots it and uses the Tallyfy connector's **Launch a Process** action to start your "Sales Proposal Review" [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) - with the file link pre-populated in the kick-off form.

## Building an example file management flow

Here's a practical example. Your "Project Completion" [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) has a final [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) where users upload a closure report PDF. You want that report automatically archived to SharePoint when they're done.

<Steps>

1.  **Set up the webhook trigger.**
    In Power Automate, create an **Automated cloud flow** (see [understanding Power Automate basics](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/understanding-power-automate-basics/)).
    Use the **When an HTTP request is received** trigger to catch Tallyfy [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/).
    *   Configure a webhook in Tallyfy that fires when your specific task completes.
    *   The webhook payload will include the task data and any [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) values, including file upload URLs.

2.  **Extract the file information from the webhook payload.**
    Use **Parse JSON** to extract the uploaded file's URL and filename from the webhook data.
    *   You can also use the Tallyfy connector's **Get a member's tasks** action if you need additional task details.

3.  **Download the file content.**
    If Tallyfy provides a file URL in the webhook payload, use an **HTTP** action to download the file content. Check out [working with data operations and variables](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/working-with-data-operations-and-variables/) if you're new to handling data in flows.

4.  **Create the file in SharePoint.**
    Add step: `SharePoint` - **Create file**.
    *   **Site Address:** Pick your SharePoint site.
    *   **Folder Path:** Choose the destination (like `/Project Archives/Completed Reports/`). For automatic year/month folders, use this [expression](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/advanced-conditions-and-expressions/): `/Project Archives/Completed Reports/@{formatDateTime(utcNow(),'yyyy')}/@{formatDateTime(utcNow(),'MM')}`.
    *   **File Name:** Use the filename from the webhook payload. Include the process name for clarity - something like `Project Report - [Process Name].pdf`.
    *   **File Content:** Use the downloaded file content from step 3.

5.  **(Optional) Notify the team.**
    Action: **Post a message in a chat or channel** (Microsoft Teams connector).
    *   Send a message to your project channel: "Project Closure Report for `[Process Name]` has been archived."

6.  **Save and test your flow.**
    Complete the Tallyfy task with a real file upload and verify the flow runs correctly. Need help debugging? Check [managing and monitoring flows](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/managing-and-monitoring-power-automate-flows/).

</Steps>

## Tips for file automation with Tallyfy

*   **Organize your folders first.** Keep SharePoint/OneDrive structures clear before building flows - it makes setup much easier.
*   **Check permissions early.** Your Power Automate connection needs the right access for file operations. Verify this before building your flow.
*   **Use consistent file names.** Include the Tallyfy [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) or [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) ID in filenames (like `ProcessID_ReportName.pdf`) so files stay traceable.
*   **Prefer webhooks over polling.** Tallyfy's [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) and [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) give you precise control over when flows trigger - more reliable than monitoring folders.
*   **Add error handling.** Files go missing. Formats get weird. Build error handling into your flows so they don't fail silently.
