Microsoft Power Automate (formerly Flow) is an integration service that connects your Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) with the Microsoft ecosystem and other business applications. This extends Tallyfy's capabilities by automating tasks and data flows between Tallyfy and other systems your organization uses.

Tallyfy serves as your primary platform for defining, managing, and tracking human-centric [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). Power Automate works as a complementary tool to handle system-to-system integrations and automate separate tasks that happen around your Tallyfy workflows, often without extensive coding knowledge.

| Use Power Automate for... | Use Tallyfy for... |
|---------------------------|--------------------|
| Data movement between systems | Human workflow management and [procedure templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) |
| Automated system processes | Interactive [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) assignment and tracking |
| Technical integration focus | Business user experience and process visibility |
| Event-triggered [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) rules | [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) standardization and improvement |
| Backend system connectivity | Visual process tracking and collaboration |

Benefits of using Power Automate with Tallyfy include:

*   **Data synchronization**: Keep information consistent between Tallyfy and other business systems.
*   **Automated triggers**: Initiate Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) or [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) when specific events occur in other applications.
*   **Microsoft ecosystem integration**: Connect Tallyfy with Office 365, SharePoint, Dynamics, and Teams.
*   **[form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) data processing**: Process data submitted in Tallyfy [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) in other systems.
*   **Custom notifications**: Create advanced notification workflows based on Tallyfy events.

For example, you could automatically start a Tallyfy "New Employee Onboarding" [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) when a candidate is marked as "Hired" in your HR system, or update a sales CRM when a "Client Proposal" [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) is completed in Tallyfy. Power Automate provides the bridge for these integrations.

For more perspective on how these platforms compare, you might find some [insights on approvals workflows](https://tallyfy.com/integrations/using-microsoft-flow-for-approvals/) useful, keeping in mind that Tallyfy offers robust built-in approval capabilities.

## Key considerations when using Tallyfy with Power Automate

*   **Authentication**: Securely manage your Tallyfy connection in Power Automate. Check [how to integrate Tallyfy with Microsoft Power Automate](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/) for details on setting up the Tallyfy connector.
*   **Tallyfy Connector**: Get familiar with the available triggers and actions in the official [Tallyfy connector for Power Automate](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/).
*   **Tallyfy API & Webhooks**: For advanced scenarios not covered by the connector, Tallyfy offers a robust [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) and [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) that can be used with Power Automate's HTTP request trigger/action.
*   **Error Handling**: Set up error handling within your Power Automate flows to manage potential issues gracefully. Check [managing and monitoring Power Automate flows](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/managing-and-monitoring-power-automate-flows/).
*   **Performance and Limits**: Be aware of Power Automate flow execution limits and API call limits for both Tallyfy and other connected services to make sure your automations run smoothly.

By using Power Automate as an integration tool, Tallyfy Pro users can extend the power of their process management platform, creating end-to-end automations that save time and reduce manual effort.
