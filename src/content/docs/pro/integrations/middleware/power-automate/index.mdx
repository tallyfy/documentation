## How to leverage Microsoft's integration platform with your Tallyfy workflows

Microsoft Power Automate (formerly Flow) is an enterprise [integration](/products/pro/integrations/) platform that connects Tallyfy with the Microsoft ecosystem and hundreds of other business applications. This integration leverages the complementary strengths of both platforms.

### Complementary capabilities

| Technical integration focus | Business user experience |
| Event-triggered [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) | [Process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) standardization |
| Backend system connectivity | Visual process tracking |
