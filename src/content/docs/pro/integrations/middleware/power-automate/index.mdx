Microsoft Power Automate (formerly Flow) connects your Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) with Microsoft tools and other business applications. For background on what Power Automate can do, see our [Power Automate explainer](https://tallyfy.com/what-is-microsoft-flow-power-automate/). It acts as the bridge that lets Tallyfy talk to your other systems, automating data flows between them.

Tallyfy handles defining, managing, and tracking human-centric [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). Power Automate complements this by handling the system-to-system integrations and automated actions that happen around your Tallyfy workflows -- no coding required.

The official Tallyfy connector for Power Automate is a Premium tier connector that uses OAuth 2.0 authentication. It provides 13 actions (and no triggers) for managing processes, tasks, members, and guests directly from your flows.

| Use Power Automate for... | Use Tallyfy for... |
|---------------------------|--------------------|
| Data movement between systems | Human workflow management and [procedure templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) |
| Automated system processes | Interactive [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) assignment and tracking |
| Technical integration focus | Business user experience and process visibility |
| Event-triggered [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) rules | [Process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) standardization and improvement |
| Backend system connectivity | Visual process tracking and collaboration |

Combining Power Automate with Tallyfy gives you:

*   **Data synchronization** -- Keep information consistent between Tallyfy and other business systems without double entry.
*   **Automated flows** -- Use Power Automate flow triggers (like a new email or SharePoint event) to launch Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) or create [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) through the connector's actions.
*   **Microsoft tools integration** -- Connect Tallyfy with Office 365, SharePoint, Dynamics, and Teams so your whole Microsoft stack works together.
*   **[Form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) data processing** -- Send data submitted in Tallyfy [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to other systems automatically.
*   **Custom notifications** -- Build notification workflows based on Tallyfy events.

For example, when a candidate gets marked as "Hired" in your HR system, Power Automate can automatically kick off a Tallyfy "New Employee Onboarding" [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). Or when someone completes a "Client Proposal" [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in Tallyfy, it updates your sales CRM.

For more on how these platforms compare, see these [insights on approvals workflows](https://tallyfy.com/integrations/using-microsoft-flow-for-approvals/). Tallyfy also has built-in approval capabilities.

## Key considerations

*   **Authentication** -- The Tallyfy connector uses OAuth 2.0. You sign in with your Tallyfy account and provide your organization ID during setup. See [how to integrate Tallyfy with Microsoft Power Automate](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/) for steps.
*   **Tallyfy connector** -- The connector provides 13 actions (no triggers) covering process launches, task completion, comments, member invitations, and more. See the full [Tallyfy connector for Power Automate](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/) details.
*   **Tallyfy API and webhooks** -- Need something the connector does not cover? Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) and [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) work with Power Automate's HTTP request action.
*   **Error handling** -- Set up error handling in your flows to manage failures gracefully. Learn more about [managing and monitoring Power Automate flows](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/managing-and-monitoring-power-automate-flows/).
*   **Rate limits** -- The connector allows 100 API calls per minute per connection. Power Automate also has its own flow execution limits.

Power Automate extends Tallyfy Pro by letting you create end-to-end automations that save time and eliminate manual tasks.
