Microsoft Power Automate (formerly Flow) connects your Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) with the Microsoft ecosystem and other business applications. Think of it as the bridge that lets Tallyfy talk to your other systems - automating data flows and tasks between them.

Here's the thing: Tallyfy remains your go-to platform for defining, managing, and tracking human-centric [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). Power Automate complements this by handling the technical plumbing - those system-to-system integrations and automated tasks that happen around your Tallyfy workflows. Best part? You don't need extensive coding knowledge.

| Use Power Automate for... | Use Tallyfy for... |
|---------------------------|--------------------|
| Data movement between systems | Human workflow management and [procedure templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) |
| Automated system processes | Interactive [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) assignment and tracking |
| Technical integration focus | Business user experience and process visibility |
| Event-triggered [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) rules | [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) standardization and improvement |
| Backend system connectivity | Visual process tracking and collaboration |

Why combine Power Automate with Tallyfy? Here are the payoffs:

*   **Data synchronization**: Keep information consistent between Tallyfy and other business systems. No more double entry.
*   **Automated triggers**: Start Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) or [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) when specific events happen in other applications - like magic.
*   **Microsoft ecosystem integration**: Connect Tallyfy with Office 365, SharePoint, Dynamics, and Teams. Your whole Microsoft stack plays nice together.
*   **[form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) data processing**: Take data submitted in Tallyfy [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) and use it in other systems automatically.
*   **Custom notifications**: Create sophisticated notification workflows based on Tallyfy events.

Want a real example? When a candidate gets marked as "Hired" in your HR system, Power Automate can automatically kick off a Tallyfy "New Employee Onboarding" [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). Or when someone completes a "Client Proposal" [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in Tallyfy, it updates your sales CRM instantly. That's the power of integration.

For more perspective on how these platforms compare, check out these [insights on approvals workflows](https://tallyfy.com/integrations/using-microsoft-flow-for-approvals/). Keep in mind though - Tallyfy already has solid built-in approval capabilities.

## Key considerations when using Tallyfy with Power Automate

*   **Authentication**: You'll need to securely manage your Tallyfy connection in Power Automate. See [how to integrate Tallyfy with Microsoft Power Automate](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/) for the exact setup steps.
*   **Tallyfy Connector**: Familiarize yourself with the triggers and actions available in the official [Tallyfy connector for Power Automate](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/). It's your toolbox.
*   **Tallyfy API & Webhooks**: Need something the connector doesn't cover? Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) and [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) work perfectly with Power Automate's HTTP request trigger/action.
*   **Error Handling**: Things go wrong sometimes. Set up error handling in your Power Automate flows to handle issues gracefully. Learn more about [managing and monitoring Power Automate flows](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/managing-and-monitoring-power-automate-flows/).
*   **Performance and Limits**: Power Automate has flow execution limits. So does Tallyfy's API. Stay within these boundaries to keep your automations running smoothly.

Power Automate extends Tallyfy Pro's capabilities significantly. You can create end-to-end automations that save real time - we're talking hours per week - and eliminate those tedious manual tasks that nobody enjoys doing.
