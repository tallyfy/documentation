## How to leverage Microsoft's integration platform with your Tallyfy workflows

Microsoft Power Automate (formerly Flow) is an enterprise [integration](/products/pro/integrations/) platform that connects Tallyfy with the Microsoft ecosystem and hundreds of other business applications. This integration leverages the complementary strengths of both platforms.

### Complementary capabilities

| Microsoft Power Automate | Tallyfy |
|--------------------------|---------|
| Data movement between systems | Human workflow management |
| Automated system processes | Interactive [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) assignment |
| Technical integration focus | Business user experience |
| Event-triggered [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) | [Process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) standardization |
| Backend system connectivity | Visual process tracking |

### Integration benefits

Power Automate complements Tallyfy by providing:

- **Data synchronization** - Keep information consistent across business systems
- **Automated triggers** - Initiate Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) when specific events occur
- **Microsoft ecosystem integration** - Connect with Office 365, SharePoint, and Dynamics
- **[Form data](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) processing** - Process Tallyfy form submissions in other systems
- **Custom notifications** - Create advanced notification workflows

### Use case recommendations

For optimal results, use each platform for its strengths:

- **Use Tallyfy for** - Human-centered workflows, [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) standardization, and visual tracking of work in progress
- **Use Power Automate for** - System-to-system [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/), data transformation, and integrating Tallyfy with other applications
