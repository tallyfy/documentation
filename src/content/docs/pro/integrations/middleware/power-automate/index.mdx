## How to leverage Microsoft's integration platform with your Tallyfy workflows

Microsoft Power Automate (formerly Flow) is an enterprise [integration](/products/pro/integrations/) platform that connects Tallyfy with the Microsoft ecosystem and hundreds of other business applications. This integration leverages the complementary strengths of both platforms.
