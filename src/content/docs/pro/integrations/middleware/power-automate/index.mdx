## Power Automate and Tallyfy

Microsoft Power Automate is a middleware product that allows you to move data between different apps without the need for coding.

However, when it comes to running workflows between people, Tallyfy is the better choice. Unlike Power Automate - Tallyfy is designed with non-technical and business users in mind and has a proper UI to track workflows visually.

A bit more about the pains of Microsoft Power Automate is [here](https://tallyfy.com/integrations/using-microsoft-flow-for-approvals/).

It's best to stick to what Power Automate was always designed to be - middleware that moves data between apps, making it a complimentary fit to Tallyfy.
