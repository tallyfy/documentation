title: Automating Microsoft Entra ID with Power Automate
---

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) is Microsoft's cloud-based identity service. Power Automate pairs well with it for automating repetitive identity admin tasks - especially when you're managing Tallyfy [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) and their access through [SSO](/products/pro/integrations/authentication/).

## Why automate Entra ID for Tallyfy

Power Automate can handle the busywork: onboarding users who need Tallyfy access, removing people when they leave, managing group-based roles, and generating compliance reports.

*   **Sync [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) automatically:** When your Tallyfy member list ties to Entra ID groups, Power Automate adds and removes users for you.
*   **Control access through [SSO](/products/pro/integrations/authentication/):** Link Tallyfy SSO to Entra ID security groups, then let Power Automate manage group membership.
*   **Generate compliance reports:** Pull Entra ID group membership data for quarterly access reviews in seconds.

## Key Entra ID actions for Tallyfy integration

Here's what Power Automate offers for Entra ID and Tallyfy:

*   **Entra ID Connector:** The main tool for user and group operations affecting Tallyfy access. See [understanding Power Automate basics](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/understanding-power-automate-basics/) for connector fundamentals.
    *   `Get user profile (V2)` and `Get manager (V2)`: Pull user details for Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) assignments.
    *   `Create user`, `Update user`, `Delete user`: Automate the full user lifecycle - joining, changing roles, or leaving.
    *   `Add user to group`, `Remove user from group`: Control which Entra ID groups grant Tallyfy access.
    *   `List group members`, `List users`: Build "who has access to what" reports.
*   **Office 365 Groups Connector:** Useful if you organize teams needing Tallyfy access through Microsoft 365 Groups.
*   **HTTP with Microsoft Graph API (Advanced):** For anything the standard connectors can't handle - like pulling custom user attributes for Tallyfy role assignments. See [connecting Power Automate to external data](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/connecting-power-automate-to-external-data/).

## Example - add a new Tallyfy member to an Entra ID group

**Scenario:** Sales [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) joining Tallyfy should be automatically added to a "Tallyfy Users" Entra ID security group.

*This assumes you have a trigger for when someone joins Tallyfy. Tallyfy supports [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) for member events (like user invited and user activated), or you could use an HR system trigger. For this demo, we'll use a [manual trigger](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/triggering-flows-manually-button-flows/).*

<Steps>

1.  **Trigger: Manually trigger a flow (for demo purposes).**
    *   Add input fields: `User Email` (Text), `Job Title` (Text).

2.  **Action: Entra ID - "Get user (V2)".**
    *   **User UPN or ID:** Use `User Email` from the trigger. This retrieves the user's Entra ID profile, including the Object ID you'll need for group management.

3.  **Control: "Condition".**
    *   See [using conditional logic](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/using-conditional-logic-in-power-automate/) for details.
    *   **Value 1:** `Job Title` from the trigger.
    *   **Operator:** `contains` (or `is equal to` for exact matches).
    *   **Value 2:** `Sales`.

4.  **IF YES branch: Entra ID - "Add user to group".**
    *   **Group Id:** The Object ID of your "Tallyfy Sales Users" security group (find it in Azure portal under Microsoft Entra ID > Groups).
    *   **User Id:** The `Id` (Object ID) from the "Get user (V2)" output.

5.  **Save and test.** See [managing and monitoring flows](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/managing-and-monitoring-power-automate-flows/) for testing tips.

</Steps>

## Example - monthly Tallyfy access review report

**Scenario:** You need a monthly CSV report of everyone in your "Tallyfy General Access" Entra ID group, emailed automatically.

<Steps>

1.  **Trigger: Recurrence.**
    *   **Interval:** `1`, **Frequency:** `Month`.
    *   Pick a specific day and time.

2.  **Action: Entra ID - "List group members".**
    *   **Group Id:** The Object ID of your "Tallyfy General Access" group.

3.  **Action: "Create CSV table" (Data Operation).**
    *   See [working with data operations and variables](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/working-with-data-operations-and-variables/) for help.
    *   **From:** The `value` output from "List group members" (an array of users).
    *   **Columns:** Choose `Custom`.
        *   Header 1: `UserPrincipalName`, Value: `User Principal Name`.
        *   Header 2: `DisplayName`, Value: `Display Name`.

4.  **Action: "Send an email (V2)" (Outlook 365).**
    *   **To:** Administrator's email.
    *   **Subject:** `Monthly Tallyfy User Access Review Report`.
    *   **Body:** `Monthly report of users in the 'Tallyfy General Access' group.`
    *   Under **Show advanced options**:
    *   **Attachments Name - 1:** `TallyfyUserReport.csv`.
    *   **Attachments Content - 1:** `Output` from the "Create CSV table" action.

5.  **Save and test.**

</Steps>

## HTTP connector for advanced Entra ID tasks

When the standard connector falls short - say you need custom user properties for Tallyfy role assignments - use the HTTP action with Microsoft Graph API. Full details in [connecting Power Automate to external data](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/connecting-power-automate-to-external-data/).

You'll need to set up:
1.  **App Registration in Entra ID** with the right API permissions.
2.  **Secure credentials** in your HTTP action.
3.  **HTTP Action Configuration** - method, URI, headers, and body for Graph API calls.
4.  **Parse JSON Action** to make the response usable in your flow.

This approach requires familiarity with Entra ID app registrations and Graph API, but it opens up far more flexibility.

## Tips for Tallyfy and Entra ID automation

*   **Least privilege:** Give API permissions and service accounts only what they need.
*   **Use Object IDs, not display names:** Display names change. Object IDs don't. Always reference groups by Object ID in your flows.
*   **Test with real permissions:** If regular users run these flows, test under their account - not your admin credentials.
*   **Automate the full lifecycle:** Hook into Entra ID lifecycle events to provision and deprovision Tallyfy [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) automatically. This pairs well with [SSO](/products/pro/integrations/authentication/).
