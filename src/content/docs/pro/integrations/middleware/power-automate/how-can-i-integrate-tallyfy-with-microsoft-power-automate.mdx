## Integrating Tallyfy with Microsoft Power Automate

Microsoft Power Automate provides a powerful [integration](/products/pro/integrations/) platform that complements Tallyfy's workflow management capabilities. This integration enables automated data exchange between Tallyfy and the Microsoft ecosystem, as well as hundreds of other business applications.

### Integration Benefits

- **Microsoft ecosystem integration** - Connect with Office 365, Dynamics, and other Microsoft products
- **Low-code [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/)** - Visual workflow builder requires minimal technical expertise
- **Bidirectional data flow** - Send data to and retrieve information from Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)
- **Conditional logic** - Build sophisticated decision-based automation flows
- **Enterprise-grade [security](/products/pro/compliance/)** - Leverage Microsoft's secure authentication mechanisms

### Connection Setup Process

Establishing the connection between Tallyfy and Power Automate requires just a few steps:

1. Open Microsoft Power Automate and create a new flow
2. Add an action and search for "Tallyfy"
3. Select any Tallyfy action from the connector list
4. When prompted, enter your Tallyfy credentials:
   - Email address
   - Password
5. Authorize the connection to allow Power Automate to access your Tallyfy account

Once configured, this connection is stored securely for use in all your future flows.
