## Setting up the Tallyfy connection

You can connect Tallyfy to Microsoft Power Automate (formerly Flow) in just a few minutes. The official Tallyfy connector -- a Premium-tier connector on Microsoft's marketplace -- links Tallyfy with Microsoft tools and thousands of other business apps, so you can automate workflows between Tallyfy and the other tools your team relies on.

### Why connect Tallyfy with Power Automate?

- **Microsoft tools access** -- Link Tallyfy with Office 365, Dynamics, SharePoint, and other Microsoft products.
- **Visual workflow builder** -- Create [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/) for Tallyfy using Power Automate's drag-and-drop interface.
- **Data flows in both directions** -- Send data to and pull information from your Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).
- **Conditional logic** -- Build decision-based flows that react to Tallyfy data.
- **OAuth 2.0 [security](/products/pro/compliance/)** -- The connector uses secure OAuth authentication to protect your Tallyfy connection.

### How to set up the connection

<Steps>
1. Open Microsoft Power Automate and create a new flow (see [creating your first flow](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/creating-your-first-flow-in-power-automate/)).
2. Add an action and search for "Tallyfy" to find the connector.
3. Pick any Tallyfy action (e.g., "Launch a Process" or "Create a task").
4. When prompted, provide your connection details:
    *   **Organization ID:** Your Tallyfy Organization ID (found in [organization settings](/products/pro/settings/org-settings/)).
    *   **OAuth sign-in:** You'll be redirected to Tallyfy's login page to authorize Power Automate's access to your account.
5. Complete the sign-in to finish authorizing the connection.
</Steps>

Power Automate stores your connection securely after setup. You won't need to sign in again -- just reuse the same connection across all your flows.
