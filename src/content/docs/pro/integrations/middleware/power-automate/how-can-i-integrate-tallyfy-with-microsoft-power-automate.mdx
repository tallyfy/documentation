## How to set up the Tallyfy connection in Power Automate

Microsoft Power Automate (formerly Flow) is an [integration](/products/pro/integrations/) service that can connect Tallyfy with the Microsoft ecosystem and other business applications. This allows you to automate workflows between Tallyfy and these other services.

### Benefits of integrating Tallyfy with Power Automate

- **Connect Tallyfy to the Microsoft ecosystem**: Link Tallyfy with Office 365, Dynamics, and other Microsoft products.
- **Low-code Tallyfy [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/)**: Use a visual workflow builder to create automations for Tallyfy.
- **Bidirectional data flow with Tallyfy**: Send data to and retrieve information from your Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).
- **Conditional logic for Tallyfy workflows**: Build decision-based automation flows that interact with Tallyfy data.
- **Leverage existing [security](/products/pro/compliance/)**: Utilize secure authentication mechanisms for the connection to Tallyfy.

### Connection setup process for Tallyfy

Establishing the connection between Tallyfy and Power Automate requires these steps in Power Automate:

<Steps>
1. Open Microsoft Power Automate and create a new flow (see [creating your first flow](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/creating-your-first-flow-in-power-automate/)).
2. Add an action and search for "Tallyfy" to find the Tallyfy connector.
3. Select any Tallyfy action from the connector list (e.g., "Launch process," "Create task").
4. When prompted to create a connection, you will need to provide your Tallyfy credentials:
    *   **Connection Name:** Give your connection a descriptive name (e.g., "My Tallyfy Connection").
    *   **Organization ID:** Your Tallyfy Organization ID.
    *   **API Key:** An API Key generated from your Tallyfy [organization settings](/products/pro/settings/org-settings/) > API.
    *   **API Secret:** The corresponding API Secret from Tallyfy.
    (Refer to Tallyfy's documentation on [API access](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) for details on generating keys).
5. Authorize the connection to allow Power Automate to access your Tallyfy account.
</Steps>

Once configured, this Tallyfy connection is stored securely in Power Automate for use in all your future flows that interact with Tallyfy.

### Additional Tallyfy resources

For more information on Tallyfy's integration capabilities, refer to our documentation on the [Tallyfy Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) and [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/). While Microsoft provides [general documentation on its connectors](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/tallyfy/), Tallyfy's own resources will be most specific to leveraging Tallyfy features.
