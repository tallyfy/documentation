## How to set up a connection between Tallyfy and the Microsoft ecosystem

Microsoft Power Automate (formerly Flow) is an enterprise [integration](/products/pro/integrations/) platform that connects Tallyfy with the Microsoft ecosystem and hundreds of other business applications. This integration leverages the complementary strengths of both platforms.

### Integration benefits

- **Microsoft ecosystem integration** - Connect with Office 365, Dynamics, and other Microsoft products
- **Low-code [automation](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/)** - Visual workflow builder requires minimal technical expertise
- **Bidirectional data flow** - Send data to and retrieve information from Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)
- **Conditional logic** - Build sophisticated decision-based automation flows
- **Enterprise-grade [security](/products/pro/compliance/)** - Leverage Microsoft's secure authentication mechanisms

### Connection setup process

Establishing the connection between Tallyfy and Power Automate requires a few steps:

<Steps>
1. Open Microsoft Power Automate and create a new flow
2. Add an action and search for "Tallyfy"
3. Select any Tallyfy action from the connector list
4. When prompted, enter your Tallyfy credentials (Email address and Password).
5. Authorize the connection to allow Power Automate to access your Tallyfy account
</Steps>

Once configured, this connection is stored securely for use in all your future flows.
