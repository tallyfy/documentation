## How to set up the Tallyfy connection in Power Automate

You can connect Tallyfy to Microsoft Power Automate (formerly Flow) in about 5 minutes. This [integration](/products/pro/integrations/) service links Tallyfy with the Microsoft ecosystem and hundreds of other business applications - letting you automate workflows between Tallyfy and pretty much everything else you use.

### Benefits of integrating Tallyfy with Power Automate

- **Connect Tallyfy to the Microsoft ecosystem**: Link Tallyfy with Office 365, Dynamics, and other Microsoft products.
- **Low-code Tallyfy [automations](/products/pro/documenting/templates/automations/)**: Use a visual workflow builder to create automations for Tallyfy.
- **Bidirectional data flow with Tallyfy**: Send data to and retrieve information from your Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).
- **Conditional logic for Tallyfy workflows**: Build decision-based automation flows that interact with Tallyfy data.
- **Leverage existing [security](/products/pro/compliance/)**: Utilize secure authentication mechanisms for the connection to Tallyfy.

### Connection setup process for Tallyfy

Here's exactly how to establish the connection between Tallyfy and Power Automate:

<Steps>
1. Open Microsoft Power Automate and create a new flow (see [creating your first flow](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/creating-your-first-flow-in-power-automate/)).
2. Add an action and search for "Tallyfy" to find the Tallyfy connector.
3. Select any Tallyfy action from the connector list (e.g., "Launch process," "Create task").
4. When prompted to create a connection, you will need to provide your Tallyfy credentials:
    *   **Connection Name:** Give your connection a descriptive name (e.g., "My Tallyfy Connection").
    *   **Organization ID:** Your Tallyfy Organization ID.
    *   **API Key:** An API Key generated from your Tallyfy [organization settings](/products/pro/settings/org-settings/) > API.
    *   **API Secret:** The corresponding API Secret from Tallyfy.
    (Refer to Tallyfy's documentation on [API access](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) for details on generating keys).
5. Authorize the connection to allow Power Automate to access your Tallyfy account.
</Steps>

Once you've done this, Power Automate stores your Tallyfy connection securely. You won't need to re-enter these credentials - just use the same connection in all your future flows.

While Microsoft provides [general documentation on its connectors](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/tallyfy/), Tallyfy's own resources give you the most specific guidance for getting the most out of Tallyfy features.
