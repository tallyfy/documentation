title: Triggering flows manually (button flows)
---

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

While many Power Automate flows are designed to run automatically to support your Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), there are times when you need to initiate an automation on demand that interacts with Tallyfy. These are known as **instant flows**, often called **button flows** as they can be triggered by pressing a button in the Power Automate mobile app or web portal.

## What are instant (button) flows for Tallyfy?

Instant flows are workflows you start manually to perform actions related to Tallyfy. They don't wait for an external event; they execute when you explicitly tell them to.

This makes them useful for Tallyfy users for:

*   **Ad-hoc Tallyfy tasks:** Actions you need to perform irregularly with Tallyfy but want to standardize.
*   **Quick Tallyfy actions:** Simple, repetitive tasks involving Tallyfy you want to accomplish with a single click.
*   **Flows requiring user input for Tallyfy:** Gathering specific information from the user before the automation proceeds to interact with Tallyfy.

## Why use button flows with Tallyfy?

Button flows can be a powerful way to interact with your Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) and [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) on demand:

*   **Quickly launch Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/):** Start a standard Tallyfy [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) from your mobile device. You can design the button flow to ask for initial information to pre-fill Tallyfy launch [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/).
*   **Log quick notes or tasks to Tallyfy:** Create a button to swiftly add a follow-up [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to your personal Tallyfy [Tasks view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/) or add a one-off task to a specific active Tallyfy [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).
*   **Send templated communications related to Tallyfy items:** A button to send a standard reminder email for an overdue Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) (though reminders are often better fully automated based on Tallyfy data).
*   **On-demand data collection for Tallyfy:** Use input fields in the button flow to gather information to populate [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) when launching a Tallyfy [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) or creating a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/).

## Creating an example button flow for Tallyfy

Let's create a button flow for a user to quickly log a new sales lead into Tallyfy. This flow will take inputs for lead name, email, and source, then launch a "Sales Lead Intake" [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in Tallyfy.

<Steps>

1.  **Start a new instant flow.**
    In Power Automate, go to **+ Create** and select **Instant cloud flow** (see [understanding Power Automate basics](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/understanding-power-automate-basics/) for flow types).

2.  **Name your flow and select the manual trigger.**
    *   **Flow name:** `Log New Sales Lead to Tallyfy`.
    *   Select **Manually trigger a flow**. Click **Create**.



3.  **Define input fields for the trigger.**
    Click **Manually trigger a flow** to expand it.
    *   Click **+ Add an input**. Select **Text**. Name it `Lead Name`.
    *   Click **+ Add an input**. Select **Text**. Name it `Lead Email`.
    *   Click **+ Add an input**. Select **Text**. Name it `Lead Source`. This can be optional.



4.  **Add the Tallyfy "Launch process" action.**
    Click **+ New step**. Search for `Tallyfy` and select the **Launch process** action from the Tallyfy [connector](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/).
    *   Connect to Tallyfy if prompted (see [how to integrate Tallyfy with Power Automate](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/)).
    *   **Blueprint ID:** Select your Tallyfy "Sales Lead Intake" [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).
    *   **Run Name:** `Lead: ` followed by the **Lead Name** dynamic content from the trigger.
    *   **Launch Form Fields:** Your Tallyfy template's launch [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) will appear. Map the trigger inputs:
        *   Tallyfy Field "Customer Name" -> Dynamic Content `Lead Name`.
        *   Tallyfy Field "Customer Email" -> Dynamic Content `Lead Email`.
        *   Tallyfy Field "Lead Source" -> Dynamic Content `Lead Source`.



5.  **(Optional) Add a confirmation notification.**
    Click **+ New step**. Search for `Notifications` and select **Send me a mobile notification**.
    *   **Text:** `New lead '[Lead Name dynamic content]' logged in Tallyfy!`

6.  **Save your flow.** Refer to [managing and monitoring flows](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/managing-and-monitoring-power-automate-flows/) for saving and testing tips.

</Steps>

## Running your Tallyfy button flow

Run your button flow via:

*   **Power Automate web portal:** Go to **My flows**, find your flow, click **Run**, fill in inputs, and click **Run flow**.
*   **Power Automate mobile app:** Go to the **Buttons** tab, find your flow button, tap it, input details, and run.

The flow will execute, launch the Tallyfy [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), and send a notification if configured.

## Tips for Tallyfy button flows

*   **Keep inputs concise for mobile:** Minimize required inputs for faster execution if primarily for mobile Tallyfy users.
*   **Use clear names:** Make button flows easily identifiable for Tallyfy actions.
*   **Combine with other actions:** After the Tallyfy action, add steps like sending emails or Teams messages related to the Tallyfy item.
*   **Button flows vs. full automation:** Consider if the Tallyfy process could be fully automated with an automated or scheduled trigger for maximum efficiency, instead of a manual button flow.
