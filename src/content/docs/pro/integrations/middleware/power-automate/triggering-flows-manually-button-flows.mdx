title: Triggering flows manually (button flows)
---

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Most Power Automate flows run automatically. But sometimes you need to kick off an automation manually - right when you need it. These are **instant flows** (also called **button flows**) because you trigger them by pressing a button in the Power Automate mobile app or web portal.

## What are instant (button) flows?

Instant flows are workflows you start manually to perform actions in Tallyfy. No waiting for external events. Press the button, they run.

They're perfect for:

*   **Ad-hoc [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/):** Irregular actions you still want to standardize
*   **Quick one-click actions:** Repetitive work you're tired of doing manually
*   **Flows needing user input:** When you need to collect info before Tallyfy automation kicks in

## Why use button flows with Tallyfy?

Button flows give you on-demand control over your Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) and [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/):

*   **Launch [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) in seconds** - start any [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) right from your phone, collecting initial info through the flow's input fields
*   **Log quick tasks** - instantly add follow-up [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to your [Tasks view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/) or drop a one-off task into an active [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)
*   **Collect data on the fly** - gather information through input fields, then pass it to Tallyfy's **Launch a Process** action as the process name or summary

## Example - log sales leads into Tallyfy

Here's a walkthrough: a button flow that logs new sales leads. You'll enter the lead's name, email, and source. The flow then launches your "Sales Lead Intake" [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in Tallyfy.

<Steps>

1.  **Start a new instant flow.**
    In Power Automate, go to **+ Create** > **Instant cloud flow** (see [understanding Power Automate basics](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/understanding-power-automate-basics/) for flow types).

2.  **Name your flow and pick the manual trigger.**
    *   **Flow name:** `Log New Sales Lead to Tallyfy`.
    *   Select **Manually trigger a flow**, then click **Create**.

3.  **Define input fields for the trigger.**
    Click **Manually trigger a flow** to expand it.
    *   Click **+ Add an input** > **Text**. Name it `Lead Name`.
    *   Click **+ Add an input** > **Text**. Name it `Lead Email`.
    *   Click **+ Add an input** > **Text**. Name it `Lead Source` (optional).

4.  **Add the Tallyfy "Launch a Process" action.**
    Click **+ New step**. Search for `Tallyfy` and select the **Launch a Process** action from the Tallyfy [connector](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/).
    *   Connect to Tallyfy if prompted (see [how to integrate Tallyfy with Power Automate](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/)).
    *   **Blueprint ID:** Select your "Sales Lead Intake" [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).
    *   **Process Name:** Type `Lead: ` followed by the **Lead Name** dynamic content from the trigger.
    *   **Summary:** Optionally include the **Lead Email** and **Lead Source** dynamic content so the details are visible on the process.

5.  **(Optional) Add a confirmation notification.**
    Click **+ New step** > search `Notifications` > select **Send me a mobile notification**.
    *   **Text:** `New lead '[Lead Name]' logged in Tallyfy!`

6.  **Save your flow.** See [managing and monitoring flows](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/managing-and-monitoring-power-automate-flows/) for testing tips.

</Steps>

## Running your button flow

Two ways to run it:

*   **Web portal:** Go to **My flows**, find your flow, click **Run**, fill in the inputs, and click **Run flow**
*   **Mobile:** Open the Power Automate app, tap **Buttons**, find your flow, tap it, and enter the details

That's it. The flow launches your Tallyfy [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) and sends you a notification (if you set one up).

## Tips for button flows

*   **Keep inputs minimal.** Fewer fields mean faster execution on mobile. Nobody likes typing on phones
*   **Name them clearly.** "Log Sales Lead" beats "Flow 1" every time
*   **Stack actions.** After the Tallyfy action, add an email or Teams notification - get more done with one button press
*   **Consider automation first.** Could this run automatically instead? A scheduled or event-based trigger sometimes makes more sense than another button to remember
