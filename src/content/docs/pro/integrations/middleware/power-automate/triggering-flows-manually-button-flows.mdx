title: Triggering flows manually (button flows)
---

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Most Power Automate flows run automatically to support your Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). But sometimes you need to kick off an automation manually - right when you need it. These are **instant flows**, often called **button flows** since you trigger them by pressing a button in the Power Automate mobile app or web portal.

## What are instant (button) flows for Tallyfy?

Instant flows are workflows you start manually to perform actions in Tallyfy. No waiting for external events. You press the button, they run.

Perfect for:

*   **Ad-hoc Tallyfy tasks:** Those irregular actions you still want to standardize
*   **Quick Tallyfy actions:** Repetitive tasks you're tired of doing manually - one click and done
*   **Flows requiring user input:** When you need to collect specific info before Tallyfy automation kicks in

## Why use button flows with Tallyfy?

Button flows give you on-demand control over your Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) and [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/). Here's what you can do:

*   **Launch Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) in seconds:** Start any [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) right from your phone. The button flow can ask for initial info to pre-fill your launch [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/)
*   **Log quick notes or tasks:** Create a button that instantly adds follow-up [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to your [Tasks view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/) or drops a one-off task into any active [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)
*   **Send templated communications:** Set up a button for standard reminder emails about overdue [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) (though honestly, automatic reminders usually work better)
*   **Collect data on the fly:** Use input fields to gather information that populates [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) when you launch a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) or create a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/)

## Creating an example button flow for Tallyfy

Let's build a real example - a button flow that logs new sales leads into Tallyfy. You'll input the lead's name, email, and source. The flow then launches your "Sales Lead Intake" [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).

<Steps>

1.  **Start a new instant flow.**
    In Power Automate, go to **+ Create** and select **Instant cloud flow** (see [understanding Power Automate basics](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/understanding-power-automate-basics/) for flow types).

2.  **Name your flow and select the manual trigger.**
    *   **Flow name:** `Log New Sales Lead to Tallyfy`.
    *   Select **Manually trigger a flow**. Click **Create**.



3.  **Define input fields for the trigger.**
    Click **Manually trigger a flow** to expand it.
    *   Click **+ Add an input**. Select **Text**. Name it `Lead Name`.
    *   Click **+ Add an input**. Select **Text**. Name it `Lead Email`.
    *   Click **+ Add an input**. Select **Text**. Name it `Lead Source`. This can be optional.



4.  **Add the Tallyfy "Launch process" action.**
    Click **+ New step**. Search for `Tallyfy` and select the **Launch process** action from the Tallyfy [connector](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/).
    *   Connect to Tallyfy if prompted (see [how to integrate Tallyfy with Power Automate](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/)).
    *   **Blueprint ID:** Select your Tallyfy "Sales Lead Intake" [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).
    *   **Run Name:** `Lead: ` followed by the **Lead Name** dynamic content from the trigger.
    *   **Launch Form Fields:** Your Tallyfy template's launch [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) will appear. Map the trigger inputs:
        *   Tallyfy Field "Customer Name" -> Dynamic Content `Lead Name`.
        *   Tallyfy Field "Customer Email" -> Dynamic Content `Lead Email`.
        *   Tallyfy Field "Lead Source" -> Dynamic Content `Lead Source`.



5.  **(Optional) Add a confirmation notification.**
    Click **+ New step**. Search for `Notifications` and select **Send me a mobile notification**.
    *   **Text:** `New lead '[Lead Name dynamic content]' logged in Tallyfy!`

6.  **Save your flow.** Refer to [managing and monitoring flows](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/managing-and-monitoring-power-automate-flows/) for saving and testing tips.

</Steps>

## Running your Tallyfy button flow

You've got two ways to run your button flow:

*   **From the web portal:** Navigate to **My flows**, find your flow, click **Run**, fill in the inputs, and click **Run flow**
*   **From your phone:** Open the Power Automate app, tap the **Buttons** tab, find your flow, tap it, enter the details, and go

That's it. The flow runs, launches your Tallyfy [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), and pings you with a notification (if you set one up).

## Tips for Tallyfy button flows

*   **Keep inputs minimal:** If you're using these on mobile, fewer fields mean faster execution. Nobody likes typing on phones
*   **Name them clearly:** "Log Sales Lead" beats "Flow 1" every time
*   **Stack your actions:** After the Tallyfy action runs, why not add an email notification or Teams message? Get more done with one button press
*   **Think twice about manual triggers:** Could this process run automatically instead? Sometimes a scheduled or event-based trigger makes more sense than another button to remember
