Email is a common business communication tool, but managing it can be time-consuming. Power Automate offers robust capabilities to automate email-related tasks, which can significantly enhance your Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) by ensuring timely actions, data capture for Tallyfy, and notifications related to Tallyfy [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/).

## Email connectors in Power Automate for Tallyfy workflows

Power Automate provides several [connectors](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/understanding-power-automate-basics/) for email services. The most commonly used is the **Outlook 365** connector. Others exist for Gmail, Outlook.com, and SMTP.

This guide primarily uses Outlook 365 examples, but the principles of email automation to support Tallyfy remain consistent across connectors.

## Common email automation scenarios for Tallyfy

Integrating email automation with Tallyfy can streamline many workflows:

*   **Reading email content to trigger Tallyfy actions:** Design flows that trigger when specific emails arrive. Power Automate can extract data from the email subject or body to automatically launch a Tallyfy [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), create a Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), or update an existing one.
    *   *Example:* An email arrives from a supplier with an invoice. Power Automate extracts invoice details and creates a "Process Invoice" [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in your Tallyfy finance [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), pre-filling these details into Tallyfy [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/).

*   **Handling email attachments for Tallyfy:** Flows can save attachments to SharePoint or OneDrive. These files can then be linked or attached to relevant Tallyfy [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/).
    *   *Example:* A client emails a project brief. A Power Automate flow saves it to SharePoint and creates a kick-off [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in the Tallyfy "New Project Onboarding" [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), attaching the brief to the Tallyfy task.

*   **Sending automated emails based on Tallyfy events:** Send customized email notifications based on Tallyfy events (e.g., [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) completion, [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) milestone). Trigger these using the Tallyfy [connector](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/) or Tallyfy [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/). Emails can include dynamic content from Tallyfy [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/).
    *   *Example:* When a Tallyfy "Customer Onboarding" [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) step "Send Welcome Pack" is completed, Power Automate sends a personalized welcome email, merging customer details from Tallyfy [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/).

## Building an example email automation flow for Tallyfy

Let's build a flow that monitors a shared mailbox (e.g., `orders@yourcompany.com`) for emails with the subject "New Order Request." It then launches a Tallyfy "New Order Processing" [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), populating it with email details.

<Steps>

1.  **Create a new automated cloud flow.**
    In Power Automate, select **+ Create** > **Automated cloud flow** (see [understanding Power Automate basics](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/understanding-power-automate-basics/)).
    Name it `Process New Email Orders into Tallyfy`.
    Select trigger **When a new email arrives in a shared mailbox (V2)** (Outlook 365). Click **Create**.

2.  **Configure the shared mailbox trigger.**
    *   **Mailbox Address:** Enter the email address of the shared mailbox (e.g., `orders@yourcompany.com`).
    *   **Folder:** Usually `Inbox`.
    *   Click **Show advanced options**.
    *   **Subject Filter:** `New Order Request`.
    *   **Include Attachments:** Set to `Yes` if order details might be in attachments.
    *   **To:** You can specify the shared mailbox address here too, to be very precise.

3.  **(Optional) Get email attachments.**
    If order info is in an attachment, add **Get attachment (V2)** (Outlook 365). This may create an "Apply to each" loop if multiple attachments are possible. For this example, we assume key data is in the email body/subject. See [managing files with Power Automate](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/managing-files-with-power-automate/) for attachment handling.

4.  **Add Tallyfy "Launch process" action.**
    Click **+ New step**, search `Tallyfy`, select **Launch process** from the Tallyfy [connector](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/).
    *   **Blueprint ID:** Select your Tallyfy "New Order Processing" [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).
    *   **Run Name (Process Name):** Use dynamic content, e.g., `New Order - [Subject from Email]`. Use `utcNow()` expression for date/time.
    *   **Launch Form Fields:** If your Tallyfy template has a launch form, its [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) will appear. Map dynamic content from the email trigger (e.g., **From**, **Subject**, **Body Preview**) to these Tallyfy fields.
        *   *Tallyfy Tip:* Design your Tallyfy [procedure template's](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) launch form with clear fields for Power Automate population.

    :::note[Advanced Data Handling]
    For complex email bodies (HTML), use expressions or actions like "HTML to text" (see [working with data operations and variables](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/working-with-data-operations-and-variables/)) before passing to Tallyfy. For very complex data extraction, consider [AI Builder](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/leveraging-ai-builder-in-power-automate/). For interactions beyond the Tallyfy connector, explore the [Tallyfy API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/).
    :::

5.  **(Optional) Send a confirmation email.**
    Add a **Send an email (V2)** action (Outlook 365).
    *   **To:** Use dynamic content **From** (the original sender of the order request).
    *   **Subject:** `Your Order Request ([Subject from Email]) has been received`.
    *   **Body:** `Thank you for your order. We are processing it in Tallyfy. Your reference is [Process Name from Tallyfy Launch process action output].`

6.  **Save and test your flow.** (See [managing and monitoring flows](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/managing-and-monitoring-power-automate-flows/) for testing tips).
    Send an email to the shared mailbox. Check if the Tallyfy process is launched.

</Steps>

## Best practices for email automation with Tallyfy

*   **Be specific with triggers:** Use precise subject filters or sender addresses to ensure flows run only when intended for Tallyfy, avoiding unnecessary [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) calls.
*   **Plan data extraction for Tallyfy:** Define what email information maps to Tallyfy [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) or process names.
*   **Design Tallyfy templates for automation:** When creating Tallyfy [procedure templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) for Power Automate, design launch forms and task forms with clear, consistently named fields.
*   **Robust error handling:** Implement error handling for scenarios like missing attachments or unexpected email formats when interacting with Tallyfy.
*   **Test thoroughly:** Test with various email formats and senders for robust Tallyfy integration.
