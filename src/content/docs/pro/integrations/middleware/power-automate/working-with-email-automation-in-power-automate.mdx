title: Working with email automation in Power Automate

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Power Automate can handle email tasks automatically and connect them to your Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). You get data capture, actions, and notifications for your Tallyfy [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) without manual work.

## Email connectors in Power Automate

Power Automate offers several [connectors](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/understanding-power-automate-basics/) for email services. **Outlook 365** is the most common. Gmail, Outlook.com, and SMTP connectors are also available.

These examples use Outlook 365, but the same patterns apply across all email connectors when connecting to Tallyfy.

## Common email automation scenarios

Here are the scenarios that save the most time:

*   **Email content triggers Tallyfy actions:** Flows watch for specific emails, extract data from the subject or body, then launch a Tallyfy [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), create a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), or update existing work.
    *   *Example:* A supplier sends an invoice email. Power Automate grabs the invoice details and launches a "Process Invoice" [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) in Tallyfy. The invoice data fills your Tallyfy [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) automatically.

*   **Email attachments feed into Tallyfy:** Flows save attachments to SharePoint or OneDrive, then link them to the right Tallyfy [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/).
    *   *Example:* A client emails a project brief. Power Automate saves it to SharePoint and launches your Tallyfy "New Project Onboarding" [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). The brief attaches to the first [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) so your team sees it right away.

*   **Tallyfy events send automated emails:** Use Tallyfy [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) to start a Power Automate flow when something happens in Tallyfy - like a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) completion or [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) milestone. Pull data from Tallyfy [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to personalize each message.
    *   *Example:* Someone completes the "Send Welcome Pack" step in your "Customer Onboarding" [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). Power Automate sends a personalized welcome email using the customer's name and preferences from your Tallyfy [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/).

## Building an example email automation flow

Here's a practical walkthrough. We'll create a flow that watches a shared mailbox (`orders@yourcompany.com`) for emails with "New Order Request" in the subject. When one arrives, it launches your Tallyfy "New Order Processing" [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) with all the order details filled in.

<Steps>

1.  **Create a new automated cloud flow.**
    In Power Automate, select **+ Create** > **Automated cloud flow** (see [understanding Power Automate basics](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/understanding-power-automate-basics/)).
    Name it `Process New Email Orders into Tallyfy`.
    Pick the trigger **When a new email arrives in a shared mailbox (V2)** (Outlook 365). Click **Create**.

2.  **Configure the email trigger.**
    *   **Mailbox Address:** Enter the shared mailbox address (e.g., `orders@yourcompany.com`).
    *   **Folder:** Usually `Inbox`.
    *   Click **Show advanced options**.
    *   **Subject Filter:** `New Order Request`.
    *   **Include Attachments:** Set to `Yes` if order details might come as attachments.

3.  **(Optional) Get email attachments.**
    If order details come as attachments, add **Get attachment (V2)** (Outlook 365). You may see an "Apply to each" loop for multiple attachments. This example assumes data is in the email body. See [managing files with Power Automate](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/managing-files-with-power-automate/) for attachment handling details.

4.  **Add the Tallyfy "Launch Process" action.**
    Click **+ New step**, search `Tallyfy`, and select **Launch Process** from the Tallyfy [connector](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/).
    *   **Blueprint ID:** Select your "New Order Processing" [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).
    *   **Process Name:** Use dynamic content, e.g., `New Order - [Subject from Email]`. Use the `utcNow()` expression for timestamps.
    *   **Kick-off Form Fields:** If your template has a kick-off form, its [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) appear here. Map email data (like **From**, **Subject**, **Body Preview**) to these fields.
        *   *Tip:* Name your [template's](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) kick-off form fields clearly so the Power Automate mapping is straightforward.

    :::note[Advanced data handling]
    For HTML emails, use an "HTML to text" action first (see [working with data operations and variables](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/working-with-data-operations-and-variables/)). For complex extraction, try [AI Builder](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/using-ai-builder-in-power-automate/). For full control, use the [Tallyfy API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) directly.
    :::

5.  **(Optional) Send a confirmation email.**
    Add a **Send an email (V2)** action (Outlook 365).
    *   **To:** Use dynamic content **From** (the original sender).
    *   **Subject:** `Your Order Request ([Subject from Email]) has been received`.
    *   **Body:** `Thank you for your order. We are processing it in Tallyfy. Your reference is [Process Name from the Launch Process output].`

6.  **Save and test your flow.**
    Send a test email to your shared mailbox and confirm the Tallyfy process launches correctly. (See [managing and monitoring flows](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/managing-and-monitoring-power-automate-flows/) for testing tips.)

</Steps>

## Best practices for email automation with Tallyfy

*   **Be specific with email triggers:** Use exact subject lines or sender addresses. Overly broad triggers waste your connector's [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) call limit of 100 calls per minute.
*   **Plan your data mapping:** Decide which email parts go where before you build. Subject line to process name? Body text to a description field? Map it out first.
*   **Design templates for automation:** Create [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) with consistent field names like "CustomerEmail" - not "email" or "Email" or "customer_email." Consistent naming prevents mapping errors.
*   **Add error handling:** What happens when an attachment is missing or the email format is unexpected? Build in fallbacks so your Tallyfy processes keep running.
*   **Test with varied inputs:** Send test emails from different accounts with different formats. Find the edge cases before your users do.
