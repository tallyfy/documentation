title: Managing and monitoring power automate flows
---

Once you've built Power Automate flows - especially those integrated with your critical Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) - you need to manage and monitor them properly. This guide walks you through managing these flows, including collaboration, backups, environment migrations, and troubleshooting common Tallyfy connection issues.

## Sharing and collaborating on flows

Automating your Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) is rarely a solo effort. You'll often need teammates to help build, test, and maintain flows. Power Automate's sharing features keep your Tallyfy automations running smoothly even when team members change.

*   **Why share flows?**
    *   **Team collaboration:** Multiple people can work on the same flow, testing and improving it together.
    *   **Business continuity:** What happens when someone leaves? Shared ownership means your automations don't break when the original creator moves on.

*   **Adding co-owners:**
    *   You can add other users or Microsoft 365 groups as co-owners of a cloud flow.
    *   Co-owners get full permissions - they can edit the flow, check its run history, and manage connections (like the [Tallyfy connector](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/)) for that specific flow. They can even add or remove other owners.
    *   To add a co-owner: Navigate to **My flows** in Power Automate, select the flow, and click **Share**. Type in the person's name or email.
    *   **Connection sharing:** Here's something important - when you share a flow, its connections (to Tallyfy, Outlook, SharePoint) become available to co-owners *only for that flow*. They can't use these connections in their other flows.

*   **Run-only users (for manually triggered flows):**
    *   For instant (button) flows that can be [triggered manually](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/triggering-flows-manually-button-flows/), you can grant run-only permissions.
    *   These users can trigger the flow - like starting a Tallyfy [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) with a button click - but they can't peek under the hood or change anything.
    *   Perfect for giving teams standardized tools without letting them accidentally break the automation.
    *   To set run-only permissions: Go to the flow's details page, find the **Run only users** section, and click **Edit**.

*   **Sharing desktop flows:** Desktop flows for [RPA](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/introduction-to-rpa-with-power-automate/) work the same way. You can share them with run or co-owner permissions through the Power Automate web portal.

## Exporting and importing flows

You'll need to export and import flows for several reasons - backing them up, moving between environments, or sharing your automation solutions with other teams using Tallyfy.

*   **Why export/import?**
    *   **Backup and recovery:** Export your complex Tallyfy integrations regularly. Trust me, you'll thank yourself later.
    *   **Environment migration:** Move flows from test to production without rebuilding everything from scratch.
    *   **Sharing solutions:** Package a flow with all its dependencies to share with other teams in your organization.

*   **Exporting a flow:**
    1.  Go to **My flows** in Power Automate, find the flow you want to export.
    2.  Click the ellipsis (...) and select **Export** > **Package (.zip)**.

    3.  Give your package a **Name** and **Description**.
    4.  Under "Review Package Content," decide what happens on import for each resource - update existing items or create new ones.
    5.  Click **Export**. You'll get a .zip file.

*   **Importing a flow:**
    1.  Go to **My flows** and click **Import**.
    2.  **Upload** the .zip package file.
    3.  During import, configure each resource:
        *   For the flow: Choose **Create as new** or **Update an existing flow**.
        *   For connections (like your [Tallyfy connector](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/) or SharePoint): Pick an existing connection or create a new one.

    4.  When everything shows green checkmarks, click **Import**.

## Monitoring flow run history

Want to know if your Tallyfy automations are actually working? The run history tells you everything. Access it through the [Power Automate interface](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/understanding-power-automate-basics/).

*   **Accessing run history:**
    *   Click on a flow name in **My flows** to see its details page with run history.
    *   Or click the ellipsis (...) next to any flow and select **Run history**.
*   **Understanding the run history:** Each run shows:
    *   **Start time**
    *   **Duration**
    *   **Status:** `Succeeded`, `Failed`, `Cancelled`, or `Running`.
*   **Drilling into a Specific Run:** Click any run's start time to see exactly what happened step by step.
    *   Expand each step to see **Inputs** and **Outputs**.
    *   For Tallyfy integrations, this shows you the exact data received from Tallyfy triggers, what you sent to Tallyfy actions (like "Create task" through the [Tallyfy connector](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/)), and Tallyfy's response.
*   **Resubmitting failed flows:** Service hiccup caused a failure? You can often resubmit the failed run with the same trigger data right from the history page.

## Basic troubleshooting

Things not working? Here's how to troubleshoot your Tallyfy-integrated flows. (If you're new to this, check out [Power Automate basics](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/understanding-power-automate-basics/) first.)

*   **Flow checker:** Before running anything, click the **Flow checker** (look for the stethoscope icon). It catches errors before they happen.

*   **Common error types & solutions:**
    *   **Authentication errors:** See "Unauthorized" or HTTP 401/403 errors? Your credentials expired.
        *   *Solution:* Edit the flow, find the failing connection (could be your [Tallyfy connector](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/), Outlook, or SharePoint), and re-authenticate.
    *   **Action configuration errors:** Missing required fields or wrong data types (like text where numbers should be).
        *   *Solution:* Check the failed action's inputs in run history. Make sure all fields are filled and data types match. For complex data work, see [working with data operations and variables](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/working-with-data-operations-and-variables/).
    *   **Logic errors:** The flow runs but gives wrong results? Your conditions or expressions need fixing.
        *   *Solution:* Review your [conditional logic](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/using-conditional-logic-in-power-automate/) and [expressions](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/advanced-conditions-and-expressions/). Add "Compose" actions to see what values your expressions actually produce during runs.
    *   **API limits/throttling:** Making too many calls too quickly? Services (including Tallyfy) will throttle you.
        *   *Solution:* Reduce the number of calls, add delays between actions, and check the [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) documentation for specific rate limits.

*   **Interpreting error messages:** Error messages in the run history usually tell you exactly what went wrong. Read them!

*   **Using "Peek code" and "Compose":**
    *   **Peek code:** Click the ellipsis (...) on any action and select **Peek code** to see its JSON structure. Helpful for understanding how Tallyfy expects data.
    *   **Compose action:** Your best debugging friend. Add a Compose action ([details here](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/working-with-data-operations-and-variables/)) to see what any expression or dynamic content actually contains when the flow runs.

## Best practices for managing Tallyfy-Power Automate flows

*   **Clear naming:** Give your flows, triggers, and actions descriptive names. "Tallyfy New Employee Onboarding" beats "Flow 1" every time.
*   **Regular review:** Check run history weekly for your critical flows - especially those automating important Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).
*   **Documentation:** Complex flows with lots of [conditional logic](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/using-conditional-logic-in-power-automate/) or [expressions](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/advanced-conditions-and-expressions/)? Write down how they work. Future you will appreciate it.
*   **Connection security:** Keep your [Tallyfy connector](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/) and other connections secure. Consider service accounts for flows that shouldn't depend on individual user accounts.
*   **Failover planning:** What's your backup plan if a critical flow fails? Set up alerts and document manual workarounds for mission-critical automations.

Stay on top of these practices, and your Tallyfy automations will run smoothly for years to come.
