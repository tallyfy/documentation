title: Managing and monitoring power automate flows
---

Once you've built Power Automate flows that connect to Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), you'll want to keep them running smoothly. Here's how to handle collaboration, backups, migrations, and troubleshooting.

## Sharing and collaborating on flows

Automating Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) is rarely a solo effort. Power Automate's sharing features let teammates build, test, and maintain flows together - and keep things running when people change roles.

*   **Why share flows?**
    *   **Team collaboration:** Multiple people can work on the same flow, test it, and improve it together.
    *   **Business continuity:** If the original creator leaves, shared ownership keeps your automations running.

*   **Adding co-owners:**
    *   Add other users or Microsoft 365 groups as co-owners of a cloud flow.
    *   Co-owners get full permissions - editing, run history, managing connections (including the [Tallyfy connector](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/)), and adding or removing other owners.
    *   To add a co-owner: go to **My flows**, select the flow, click **Share**, and type the person's name or email.
    *   **Connection sharing:** When you share a flow, its connections (Tallyfy, Outlook, SharePoint) become available to co-owners *only for that flow*. They can't reuse those connections elsewhere.

*   **Run-only users (for manually triggered flows):**
    *   For instant (button) flows that can be [triggered manually](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/triggering-flows-manually-button-flows/), you can grant run-only permissions.
    *   These users can trigger the flow - say, starting a Tallyfy [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) with a button click - but can't view or edit the flow itself.
    *   To set this up: go to the flow's details page, find **Run only users**, and click **Edit**.

*   **Sharing desktop flows:** Desktop flows for [RPA](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/introduction-to-rpa-with-power-automate/) work the same way - share them with run or co-owner permissions through the Power Automate web portal.

## Exporting and importing flows

Exporting and importing flows is useful for backups, moving between environments, and sharing automation solutions with other teams.

*   **Why export/import?**
    *   **Backup and recovery:** Export your Tallyfy integrations regularly - you'll be glad you did when something goes wrong.
    *   **Environment migration:** Move flows from test to production without rebuilding from scratch.
    *   **Sharing solutions:** Package a flow with its dependencies to share across your organization.

*   **Exporting a flow:**
    1.  Go to **My flows**, find the flow, click the ellipsis (...), and select **Export** > **Package (.zip)**.
    2.  Give your package a **Name** and **Description**.
    3.  Under "Review Package Content," choose whether to update existing items or create new ones on import.
    4.  Click **Export** to download the .zip file.

*   **Importing a flow:**
    1.  Go to **My flows** and click **Import**, then upload the .zip package.
    2.  Configure each resource: choose **Create as new** or **Update an existing flow** for the flow itself, and pick existing or new connections (including your [Tallyfy connector](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/)).
    3.  Once everything shows green checkmarks, click **Import**.

## Monitoring flow run history

The run history tells you whether your Tallyfy automations are actually working. Access it through the [Power Automate interface](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/understanding-power-automate-basics/).

*   **Accessing run history:** Click a flow name in **My flows** to see its details page, or click the ellipsis (...) and select **Run history**.
*   **What each run shows:** Start time, duration, and status (`Succeeded`, `Failed`, `Cancelled`, or `Running`).
*   **Drilling into a run:** Click any run's start time to see step-by-step details.
    *   Expand each step to view **Inputs** and **Outputs**.
    *   For Tallyfy actions (like "Create Task" through the [Tallyfy connector](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/)), you'll see exactly what data was sent and what Tallyfy returned.
*   **Resubmitting failed runs:** If a service hiccup caused a failure, you can often resubmit the failed run with the same input data from the history page.

## Basic troubleshooting

If something isn't working, here's how to troubleshoot. (New to Power Automate? Start with [the basics](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/understanding-power-automate-basics/).)

*   **Flow checker:** Before running, click the **Flow checker** (stethoscope icon) to catch errors early.

*   **Common error types and solutions:**
    *   **Authentication errors (401/403):** Your credentials likely expired. Edit the flow, find the failing connection (your [Tallyfy connector](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/), Outlook, or SharePoint), and re-authenticate. The Tallyfy connector uses OAuth 2.0, so re-authenticating refreshes your tokens.
    *   **Action configuration errors:** Missing required fields or wrong data types. Check the failed action's inputs in run history and verify everything matches. For complex data, see [working with data operations and variables](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/working-with-data-operations-and-variables/).
    *   **Logic errors:** The flow runs but produces wrong results. Review your [conditional logic](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/using-conditional-logic-in-power-automate/) and [expressions](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/advanced-conditions-and-expressions/). Add "Compose" actions to inspect what your expressions actually produce.
    *   **API throttling:** Too many calls too fast will get throttled. Add delays between actions and check the [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) docs for rate limits.

*   **Interpreting error messages:** Run history error messages usually tell you what went wrong - read them carefully before diving deeper.

*   **"Peek code" and "Compose" for debugging:**
    *   **Peek code:** Click the ellipsis (...) on any action and select **Peek code** to see its JSON structure. Useful for checking how data gets sent to Tallyfy.
    *   **Compose action:** Add a Compose action ([details here](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/working-with-data-operations-and-variables/)) to inspect what any expression or dynamic content actually produces at runtime.

## Best practices for managing flows

*   **Clear naming:** Give flows and actions descriptive names. "Tallyfy New Employee Onboarding" beats "Flow 1" every time.
*   **Regular review:** Check run history weekly for critical flows, especially those automating key Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).
*   **Documentation:** Complex flows with lots of [conditional logic](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/using-conditional-logic-in-power-automate/) or [expressions](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/advanced-conditions-and-expressions/)? Write down how they work. Future you will appreciate it.
*   **Connection security:** Keep your [Tallyfy connector](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/how-can-i-integrate-tallyfy-with-microsoft-power-automate/) secure. Consider service accounts for flows that shouldn't depend on individual user accounts.
*   **Failover planning:** Set up alerts for critical flow failures and document manual workarounds as a safety net.
