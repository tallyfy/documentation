title: Building approval workflows with Power Automate
---

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Many business [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) require formal sign-off. Tallyfy handles [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) assignments and completions well, but sometimes you need Power Automate's approvals feature for audit trails, complex routing, or external stakeholders who aren't in Tallyfy regularly.

## Why use Power Automate approvals with Tallyfy

Power Automate approvals request and track formal sign-off through automated workflows. Connect a flow to Tallyfy's API, trigger an approval action, and the request goes to your designated approvers.

The real value: you can wrap formal sign-off steps around your Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). For example, your Tallyfy process produces a document needing client approval. Power Automate handles that external approval loop, then updates your Tallyfy process based on the client's decision.

:::note[Dataverse backend]
Power Automate approvals use Microsoft Dataverse to store approval history. You don't need to interact directly with Dataverse for standard Tallyfy-related approval scenarios.
:::

:::caution[Tallyfy connector limitations]
The Tallyfy Power Automate connector is action-only - it has no built-in triggers. To start flows based on Tallyfy events, use Power Automate's HTTP connector with Tallyfy's API, or use a recurrence trigger that polls for changes. The walkthrough below uses conceptual action names to illustrate the pattern.

## Types of approval actions in Power Automate

When building approval flows for Tallyfy items, you'll work with the "Approvals" [connector](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/understanding-power-automate-basics/):

*   **Start and wait for an approval:** Kicks off an approval for a Tallyfy-related item and waits for a response.
    *   *Common types:*
        *   **Approve/Reject - First to respond:** With multiple approvers, the first response determines the outcome.
        *   **Approve/Reject - Everyone must approve:** All approvers must respond. One rejection means the item is rejected.
        *   **Custom Responses - Wait for one/all responses:** Define custom action buttons beyond Approve/Reject.
*   **Create an approval** and **Wait for an approval (separate actions):** For advanced scenarios like parallel approvals related to a Tallyfy [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).

## Building a simple approval flow for a Tallyfy scenario

Here is a practical example: completing a Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) triggers manager approval when a financial threshold in a [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) is crossed.

**The scenario:** A team member completes a "Submit Budget Proposal" [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in Tallyfy. The task has a [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) for "Proposed Amount." Amounts over $5,000 need manager approval through Power Automate, and the result updates back in Tallyfy.

### Approval workflow visualization

This diagram shows how the budget approval flow routes between Tallyfy and Power Automate based on the amount threshold.

**Diagram description:** Budget approval workflow integrating Tallyfy with Power Automate. A completed task triggers conditional approval based on a $5,000 threshold, branching to bypass approval for smaller amounts or route through manager approval for larger ones.

**What to notice:**
- Amounts below $5,000 bypass approval entirely, while higher amounts trigger the full approval flow
- Manager approval happens in Power Automate, but the result updates back to the Tallyfy task
- The rejection path includes an optional email notification for custom follow-up

<Steps>

1.  **Trigger: Detect a completed Tallyfy task.**
    *   Create a new automated [cloud flow](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/understanding-power-automate-basics/).
    *   Since the Tallyfy connector has no built-in triggers, use an **HTTP** action to poll the Tallyfy API for completed tasks, or use a **Recurrence** trigger combined with a Tallyfy API call to check for newly completed tasks.
    *   Filter for the specific [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) containing the "Submit Budget Proposal" task.

2.  **Action: Retrieve task details via the Tallyfy API.**
    *   Use an **HTTP** action or the Tallyfy connector's **Get a member's tasks** action to retrieve [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) data.
    *   **Task ID:** Use the Task ID from the previous step's output.

3.  **Control: "Condition".**
    *   Add a Condition control (see [using conditional logic](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/using-conditional-logic-in-power-automate/)).
    *   **Value 1:** Pick the dynamic content for "Proposed Amount" [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) from the task details. You may need an [expression](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/advanced-conditions-and-expressions/) like `float(outputs('Get_task_details')?['body/forms/ProposedAmount/value'])` since Tallyfy returns text values.
    *   **Operator:** `is greater than`.
    *   **Value 2:** `5000`.



4.  **IF YES branch (Amount > $5,000):**
    *   **Action: "Get manager (V2)" (Office 365 Users connector).**
        *   **User (UPN):** Use the completer's email from the task details to find their manager.
    *   **Action: "Start and wait for an approval".**
        *   **Approval type:** `Approve/Reject - First to respond`.
        *   **Title:** Use dynamic content, e.g., `Budget Proposal Approval: [Task Name] - Amount: $[Proposed Amount]`.
        *   **Assigned to:** Use `Mail` from "Get manager (V2)".
        *   **Details (optional):** Provide context, e.g., `Please review proposal for [Task Name]. Submitted by [User Name]. Link to Tallyfy Task: [URL]`.
        *   **Item Link (optional):** Direct URL to the Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/).
    *   **Control: "Condition" (check approval outcome).**
        *   **Value 1:** Dynamic content `Outcome` from the approval action.
        *   **Operator:** `is equal to`.
        *   **Value 2:** `Approve`.
    *   **IF approved:**
        *   **Action: Tallyfy - "Add comment, report issue, resolve issue on a task".**
            *   **Task ID:** The task ID from your earlier step.
            *   **Content:** `Budget proposal approved by manager [Manager Display Name] on [Completion Date].`
    *   **IF rejected:**
        *   **Action: Tallyfy - "Add comment, report issue, resolve issue on a task".**
            *   **Task ID:** The task ID from your earlier step.
            *   **Content:** `Budget proposal rejected. Reason: [Comments from approval].`
        *   **(Optional) Action: "Send an email (V2)"** to notify the submitter.

5.  **Save and test your flow.** Complete a Tallyfy task that meets your criteria. (See [managing and monitoring flows](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/managing-and-monitoring-power-automate-flows/) for testing tips).

</Steps>

## Responding to approvals

Approvers can respond in three ways:

*   **Email:** Click the approval buttons directly in the notification email.
*   **Power Automate portal:** Find pending approvals under **Action items** > **Approvals**.
*   **Microsoft Teams:** With the [Teams integration](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/integrating-power-automate-approvals-with-microsoft-teams/), respond without leaving Teams.

## Sequential and parallel approvals

For more complex Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), you have two patterns:

*   **Sequential approvals:** The request moves from one approver to the next in order.
*   **Parallel approvals:** Requests go to multiple people at once for simultaneous review.

Combine these patterns to build approval routes that match how your organization works.

## Tips for Tallyfy approval workflows

*   **Define clear criteria:** Know which Tallyfy event starts an approval and who the approvers are.
*   **Include context:** Pull data from Tallyfy [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) or [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) into your approval request so approvers have the full picture.
*   **Close the loop:** Always push the approval outcome back to the original Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) or [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) using the Tallyfy connector's comment action.
*   **Keep it simple:** For basic approvals, use Tallyfy's built-in task assignments. Reserve Power Automate for multi-level approvals, external stakeholders, or conditional routing.
