title: Building approval workflows with Power Automate
---

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Many business [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) require formal sign-off. While Tallyfy handles [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) assignments and completions beautifully, you'll sometimes need Power Automate's approvals feature for more formal sign-offs. Think audit trails. Complex routing. External stakeholders who aren't in Tallyfy every day.

## Introduction to Power Automate approvals for Tallyfy

Power Automate approvals let you create automated workflows that request and track formal sign-off. Connect a flow to Tallyfy, trigger an approval action - boom, request goes to your designated approvers.

Here's where it gets interesting. You can use Power Automate approvals for those formal sign-off steps that wrap around your Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). Picture this: your internal Tallyfy process produces a document that needs client approval. Power Automate handles that external approval loop, then updates your Tallyfy process based on what the client decides.

:::note[Dataverse Backend]
Power Automate approvals use Microsoft Dataverse in the background to store approval history. You typically don't need to interact directly with Dataverse for standard Tallyfy-related approval scenarios.

## Types of approval actions in Power Automate for Tallyfy scenarios

When you're building approval flows for Tallyfy items, you'll mostly work with actions from the "Approvals" [connector](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/understanding-power-automate-basics/):

*   **Start and wait for an approval:** Your go-to choice. Kicks off an approval for a Tallyfy-related item and waits patiently for a response.
    *   *Common Types within this action:*
        *   **Approve/Reject - First to respond:** If sent to multiple people for a Tallyfy item, the first response determines the outcome.
        *   **Approve/Reject - Everyone must approve:** Everyone has to weigh in. One rejection? That's a no-go for your Tallyfy item.
        *   **Custom Responses - Wait for one response / Wait for all responses:** Define custom action buttons beyond Approve/Reject for Tallyfy item approvals.
*   **Create an approval** and **Wait for an approval (separate actions):** For advanced scenarios like parallel approvals related to a Tallyfy [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).

## Building a simple approval flow for a Tallyfy scenario

Let's build something real. We'll create a flow where completing a Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) triggers manager approval - but only when a financial threshold in a [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) is crossed.

**The scenario:** Your team member wraps up a "Submit Budget Proposal" [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in Tallyfy. The task has a [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) for "Proposed Amount." Anything over $5,000? That needs manager approval through Power Automate. Then we update the Tallyfy task with whatever happens.

### Approval workflow visualization

This diagram shows how the budget approval flow routes between Tallyfy and Power Automate based on the amount threshold.

```d2
Start: "Tallyfy Task Completed: Submit"
GetDetails: "Get Task Details"
Check: "Amount > 5000?" {shape: diamond}
SendApproval: "Send Approval Request"
CheckApproval: "Approved?" {shape: diamond}
UpdateApproved: "Update Task: Approved"
UpdateRejected: "Update Task: Rejected"
EmailSubmitter: "Email Submitter"
End1: "Process Continues"
End2: "Process Continues"
End3: "Process Halted"
Start -> GetDetails
GetDetails -> Check
Check -> End1: "No"
Check -> SendApproval: "Yes"
SendApproval -> CheckApproval
CheckApproval -> UpdateApproved: "Yes"
CheckApproval -> UpdateRejected: "No"
UpdateApproved -> End2
UpdateRejected -> EmailSubmitter
EmailSubmitter -> End3
```

**What to notice:**
- The $5,000 threshold creates two distinct paths - amounts below bypass approval entirely while higher amounts trigger the full approval flow
- Manager approval happens outside Tallyfy in Power Automate, but the result always updates back to the original Tallyfy task for complete visibility
- The rejection path includes an optional email notification, showing how you can add custom actions based on approval outcomes

<Steps>

1.  **Trigger: Tallyfy - "When a task is completed".**
    *   Create a new automated [cloud flow](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/understanding-power-automate-basics/).
    *   Select the Tallyfy trigger: **When a task is completed**.
    *   **Blueprint ID (Highly Recommended):** Select the specific Tallyfy [procedure template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) containing the "Submit Budget Proposal" task.

2.  **Action: Tallyfy - "Get task details".**
    *   Add this to retrieve all Tallyfy [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) data.
    *   **Task ID:** Use `Task ID` dynamic content from the trigger.

3.  **Control: "Condition".**
    *   Add a Condition control (see [using conditional logic](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/using-conditional-logic-in-power-automate/)).
    *   **Value 1:** Pick the dynamic content for "Proposed Amount" [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) from "Get task details". You'll probably need an [expression](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/advanced-conditions-and-expressions/) like `float(outputs('Get_task_details')?['body/forms/ProposedAmount/value'])` - Tallyfy sends text, but we need numbers.
    *   **Operator:** `is greater than`.
    *   **Value 2:** `5000`.



4.  **IF YES Branch (Amount > $5,000):**
    *   **Action: "Get manager (V2)" (Office 365 Users connector).**
        *   **User (UPN):** Use `Completed By User Email` from Tallyfy's "Get task details" to find the submitter's manager.
    *   **Action: "Start and wait for an approval".**
        *   **Approval type:** `Approve/Reject - First to respond`.
        *   **Title:** Use dynamic content from Tallyfy, e.g., `Budget Proposal Approval: [Task Name from Get task details] - Amount: $[Proposed Amount from Get task details]`.
        *   **Assigned to:** Use `Mail` from "Get manager (V2)".
        *   **Details (Optional):** Provide context from Tallyfy, e.g., `Please review proposal for [Task Name]. Submitted by [Completed By User Name from Tallyfy]. Link to Tallyfy Task: [Link to Tallyfy Task]`.
        *   **Item Link (Optional):** Direct URL to the Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/).



    *   **Control: "Condition" (to check approval outcome).**
        *   Add another Condition control.
        *   **Value 1:** Dynamic content `Outcome` from "Start and wait for an approval".
        *   **Operator:** `is equal to`.
        *   **Value 2:** `Approve`.
    *   **IF Approval Outcome is "Approve":**
        *   **Action: Tallyfy - "Update task"** (or **Add comment to task**).
            *   **Task ID:** `Task ID` from the initial Tallyfy trigger.
            *   **Comment/Note:** `Budget proposal approved by manager [Manager Display Name] on [Completion Date from approval].`
    *   **ELSE (Approval Outcome is "Reject"):**
        *   **Action: Tallyfy - "Update task"** (or **Add comment to task**).
            *   **Task ID:** `Task ID` from the initial Tallyfy trigger.
            *   **Comment/Note:** `Budget proposal rejected. Reason: [Comments from approval].`
        *   **(Optional) Action: "Send an email (V2)"** to the Tallyfy task submitter.

5.  **Save and test your flow.** Run through a Tallyfy task that hits your criteria. (Check out [managing and monitoring flows](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/managing-and-monitoring-power-automate-flows/) for testing tricks).

</Steps>

## Responding to approvals for Tallyfy items

Approvers have three ways to respond:

*   **Email:** Click the buttons right in the email for the Tallyfy item.
*   **Power Automate Portal:** Find it under **Action items** > **Approvals**.
*   **Microsoft Teams:** Got the [Teams integration](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/integrating-power-automate-approvals-with-microsoft-teams/)? Respond without leaving Teams.

## Sequential and parallel approvals for Tallyfy (introduction)

Need something more complex for your Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)? You've got options:

*   **Sequential approvals:** The request travels from one approver to the next - like a relay race for your Tallyfy item.
*   **Parallel approvals:** Fire off requests to multiple people at once. Everyone reviews your Tallyfy item simultaneously.

Mix and match these patterns to build sophisticated approval routes that match how your organization actually works.

## Tips for Tallyfy approval workflows using Power Automate

*   **Clear criteria:** Know exactly what Tallyfy event kicks off an approval. Know who's approving.
*   **Context matters:** Pull data from Tallyfy [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) or [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) into your approval request. Approvers need the full picture.
*   **Close the loop:** Whatever happens in Power Automate, push it back to the original Tallyfy [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) or [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). Keep everything visible in Tallyfy.
*   **Keep it simple:** Basic approvals? Stick with Tallyfy's built-in task assignments. Save Power Automate for the complex stuff - multi-level approvals, external stakeholders, conditional routing.
