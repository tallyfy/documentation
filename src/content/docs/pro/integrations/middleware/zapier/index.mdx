## What can you do with Tallyfy's Zapier integration?

Zapier is a cloud-based [integration](/products/pro/integrations/) platform that connects Tallyfy with thousands of popular business applications without requiring coding expertise. By creating automated workflows (called "Zaps"), you can streamline [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) across your technology stack.

:::note[Considering Integration Alternatives]
While Zapier can be useful for simple connections, we generally recommend more robust and cost-effective [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) solutions like **n8n**, **Make**, or **Microsoft Power Automate** for serious integrations.

For maximum control and flexibility, especially if you have development resources, consider using Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) to build custom integrations, potentially leveraging AI to generate code for serverless functions.

### Key capabilities:

- **Trigger [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) automatically** - [Launch](/products/pro/launching/) Tallyfy workflows based on events in other systems
- **Complete [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) programmatically** - Mark Tallyfy tasks as complete when external criteria are met
- **Capture form data** - Send [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) submissions to external applications
- **Synchronize information** - Keep data consistent between Tallyfy and other platforms
- **Schedule recurring [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)** - Set up time-based triggers for regular workflows

### Common integration scenarios:

- [Launch](/products/pro/launching/) onboarding processes when new employees are added to HR systems
- Create [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) when new support tickets arrive in your helpdesk
- Send completed [form data](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to CRM or ERP systems
- Notify team members in Slack when critical [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) start or complete
- Generate documents when specific tasks are completed

### Implementation approach:

1. Connect your Tallyfy account to Zapier
2. Create Zaps using Tallyfy triggers or actions
3. Test your integration with sample data
4. Activate and monitor your automated workflows
