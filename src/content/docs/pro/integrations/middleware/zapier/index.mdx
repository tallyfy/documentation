## What can you do with Tallyfy's Zapier integration?

Zapier connects Tallyfy with thousands of business apps - no coding needed. New to Zapier? Check out our [Zapier explainer](https://tallyfy.com/what-is-zapier/) first. You create automated workflows called "Zaps" that move data between Tallyfy and your other tools automatically.

:::note[Considering integration alternatives]
Zapier works well for simple connections. For more involved integrations, try [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) tools like **n8n**, **Make**, or **Microsoft Power Automate** - they've got more advanced features.

If you have developers on your team, Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) gives you full control. You can even use AI to generate serverless function code.

### Key capabilities

- **[Launch](/products/pro/launching/) [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) automatically** - Start workflows when something happens in another system
- **Complete [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/)** - Mark tasks done when external conditions are met
- **Update [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/)** - Push or pull form data between Tallyfy and other apps
- **Create standalone tasks** - Add one-off [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) with assignees, deadlines, and tags
- **React to completions** - Trigger actions in other apps when Tallyfy tasks or processes finish

### Common scenarios

- [Launch](/products/pro/launching/) onboarding when new employees appear in your HR system
- Create [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) from incoming helpdesk tickets
- Send completed [form data](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to your CRM or ERP
- Post Slack notifications when critical [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) start or wrap up

### Getting started

1. Connect your Tallyfy account to Zapier
2. Pick a Tallyfy trigger or action for your Zap
3. Test with sample data
4. Turn it on and let it run

:::note[Handling file uploads via Zapier]
Passing file content directly from Tallyfy file upload fields to Zapier doesn't always work. A practical workaround: use a text field in Tallyfy to store a **link** to the file (hosted on Google Drive, Dropbox, SharePoint, etc.) and pass that link through Zapier instead.
