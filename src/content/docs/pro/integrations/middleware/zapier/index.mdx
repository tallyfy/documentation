## Tallyfy and Zapier Integration

Zapier is a cloud-based integration platform that connects Tallyfy with thousands of popular business applications without requiring coding expertise. By creating automated workflows (called "Zaps"), you can streamline processes across your technology stack.

### Key capabilities:

- **Trigger processes automatically** - Launch Tallyfy workflows based on events in other systems
- **Complete tasks programmatically** - Mark Tallyfy tasks as complete when external criteria are met
- **Capture form data** - Send form field submissions to external applications
- **Synchronize information** - Keep data consistent between Tallyfy and other platforms
- **Schedule recurring processes** - Set up time-based triggers for regular workflows

### Common integration scenarios:

- Launch onboarding processes when new employees are added to HR systems
- Create tasks when new support tickets arrive in your helpdesk
- Send completed form data to CRM or ERP systems
- Notify team members in Slack when critical processes start or complete
- Generate documents when specific tasks are completed

### Implementation approach:

1. Connect your Tallyfy account to Zapier
2. Create Zaps using Tallyfy triggers or actions
3. Test your integration with sample data
4. Activate and monitor your automated workflows
