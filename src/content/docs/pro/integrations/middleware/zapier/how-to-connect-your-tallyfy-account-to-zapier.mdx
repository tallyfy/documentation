## Connect your Tallyfy account to Zapier

Tallyfy connects to Zapier through OAuth2[^1] - you'll authorize the connection on Tallyfy's own login page, so your credentials never pass through Zapier directly. The whole setup takes about 5 minutes.

:::note[Considering integration alternatives]
Zapier works for simple connections, but we'd generally recommend [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) platforms like **n8n**, **Make**, or **Microsoft Power Automate** for more capable, cost-effective integrations.

If you've got development resources, Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) gives you full control - you can even use AI to generate code for serverless functions.
