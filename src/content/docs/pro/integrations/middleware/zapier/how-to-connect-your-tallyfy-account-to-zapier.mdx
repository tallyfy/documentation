## Connect your Tallyfy account to Zapier

You'll need to set up secure authentication between Tallyfy and Zapier to get them talking to each other. Takes about 5 minutes.

Here's exactly how to create that connection - once it's done, you can automate workflows between Tallyfy and literally thousands of other apps through Zapier.

:::note[Considering Integration Alternatives]
While Zapier can be useful for simple connections, we generally recommend more capable and cost-effective [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) solutions like **n8n**, **Make**, or **Microsoft Power Automate** for serious integrations.

For maximum control and flexibility, especially if you have development resources, consider using Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) to build custom integrations, potentially using AI to generate code for serverless functions.
