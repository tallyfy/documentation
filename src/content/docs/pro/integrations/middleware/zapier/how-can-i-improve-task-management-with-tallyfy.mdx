## Improve task management with Tallyfy and Zapier

Tallyfy handles the human side of [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) management - the parts that need judgment, creativity, and decision-making. Zapier handles the robotic stuff. Together, they connect your existing business applications without forcing everything into rigid automation.

Here's what you get: a workflow platform that knows when to automate and when to keep humans in control. Your team completes [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) that matter while [integrations](/products/pro/integrations/) handle the repetitive grunt work.

:::note[Considering Integration Alternatives]
While Zapier works fine for simple connections, you'll want more powerful [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) solutions like **n8n**, **Make**, or **Microsoft Power Automate** for serious integrations. They cost less too.

Got developers? Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) gives you total control. You can even use AI to generate integration code for serverless functions (yes, it actually works).

### What unique value does Tallyfy provide compared to automation-only solutions?

Pure automation platforms can't handle what humans do best - think, judge, and adapt. Tallyfy fills that gap:

- **Human-centric workflows** - [Processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) built around people completing [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), not robots
- **Structured task management** - Work flows in logical order, not chaos
- **Process accountability** - You know exactly who's responsible for what
- **Cross-application [integration](/products/pro/integrations/)** - Human decisions trigger automated actions across your tech stack
- **Complete workflow coverage** - From initial documentation through final automation

### Key integration use cases

Want to see this in action? Zapier connects Tallyfy with thousands of applications. Here are the patterns that actually work:

#### 1. CRM-triggered onboarding

Deal closes in your CRM. What happens next?
- Tallyfy instantly [launches](/products/pro/launching/) your client onboarding [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)
- The right team [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) get their tasks assigned automatically
- Everyone sees progress in real-time - no more "what's the status?" emails

#### 2. Scheduled process execution

Got weekly reports? Monthly audits? Quarterly reviews?
- Set up time-based triggers in Zapier (takes 2 minutes)
- Tallyfy [launches](/products/pro/launching/) your [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) exactly when needed
- Never miss another recurring task again

#### 3. Communication-based task creation

Stop losing important requests in email and Slack:
- Send an email to support@yourcompany.com? It becomes a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in Tallyfy
- Type #urgent in Slack? A new [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) kicks off automatically
- Nothing falls through the cracks anymore

#### 4. Web form process tracking

Customer fills out your web form. Then what?
- Form data flows straight into Tallyfy
- The right [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) [launches](/products/pro/launching/) based on the request type
- You track everything from "submitted" to "done" - full visibility
