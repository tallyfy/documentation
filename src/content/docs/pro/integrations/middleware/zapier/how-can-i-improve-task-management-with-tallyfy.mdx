## Enhancing Task Management with Zapier Integration

Tallyfy specializes in managing people-driven [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) while leveraging Zapier's [integration](/products/pro/integrations/) capabilities to connect with your existing business applications. This combination provides a platform for comprehensive workflow automation that balances human [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) with system automation.

:::note[Considering Integration Alternatives]
While Zapier can be useful for simple connections, we generally recommend more capable and cost-effective [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) solutions like **n8n**, **Make**, or **Microsoft Power Automate** for serious integrations.

For maximum control and flexibility, especially if you have development resources, consider using Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) to build custom integrations, potentially leveraging AI to generate code for serverless functions.
