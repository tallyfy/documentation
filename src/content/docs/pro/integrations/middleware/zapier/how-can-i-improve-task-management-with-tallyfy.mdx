## Improve task management with Tallyfy and Zapier

Tallyfy handles the human side of [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) management - judgment, creativity, and decisions. Zapier handles the robotic parts. Together, they connect your apps without forcing everything into rigid automation.

Your team completes [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) that need human input while Zapier triggers and actions handle the repetitive work. The Tallyfy connector supports launching [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), creating standalone tasks, completing tasks, changing assignees and deadlines, and adding comments - all from Zapier.

:::note[Consider other middleware too]
Zapier works for simple connections, but [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) tools like **n8n**, **Make**, or **Microsoft Power Automate** often handle more advanced [integrations](/products/pro/integrations/) at lower cost.

Got developers? Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) gives you full control.

### Why use Tallyfy instead of automation-only tools?

Automation platforms can't handle what humans do best - think, judge, and adapt. Tallyfy fills that gap:

- **Human-centric workflows** - [Processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) built around people completing [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), not bots
- **Structured task management** - Work flows in a logical order with clear ownership
- **Cross-app [integration](/products/pro/integrations/)** - Human decisions trigger automated actions across your stack

### Key integration use cases

Here are patterns that work well with the Tallyfy Zapier connector:

#### 1. CRM-triggered onboarding

A deal closes in your CRM - then what? Zapier fires a trigger, and Tallyfy's "Launch Process" action instantly starts your client onboarding [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). The right [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) get tasks assigned automatically, and everyone sees progress without "what's the status?" emails.

#### 2. Scheduled process launches

Weekly reports? Monthly audits? Zapier's schedule trigger pairs with Tallyfy's "Launch Process" action to [launch](/products/pro/launching/) your [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) on a recurring basis. Never miss one again.

#### 3. Communication-based task creation

Stop losing requests in email and Slack. An email to support@yourcompany.com can become a standalone [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in Tallyfy. A Slack keyword can kick off an entire [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/). Nothing falls through the cracks.

#### 4. Web form tracking

Customer fills out a web form - then what? Form data flows into Tallyfy, the right [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) [launches](/products/pro/launching/) based on request type, and you track everything from "submitted" to "done."
