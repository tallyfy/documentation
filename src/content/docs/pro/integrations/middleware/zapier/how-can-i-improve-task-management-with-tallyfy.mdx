## Improve task management with Tallyfy and Zapier

Tallyfy handles the human side of [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) management - judgment, creativity, and decisions. Zapier handles the robotic parts. Together, they connect your business apps without forcing everything into rigid automation.

Your team completes [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) that need human input while [integrations](/products/pro/integrations/) handle repetitive work automatically.

:::note[Consider other middleware too]
Zapier works for simple connections, but [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) tools like **n8n**, **Make**, or **Microsoft Power Automate** handle more advanced integrations at lower cost.

Got developers? Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) gives you full control - you can even use AI to generate integration code for serverless functions.

### Why use Tallyfy instead of automation-only tools?

Automation platforms can't handle what humans do best - think, judge, and adapt. Tallyfy fills that gap:

- **Human-centric workflows** - [Processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) built around people completing [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), not bots
- **Structured task management** - Work flows in a logical order
- **Process accountability** - You know exactly who's responsible for what
- **Cross-app [integration](/products/pro/integrations/)** - Human decisions trigger automated actions across your stack
- **Full workflow coverage** - From documentation through automation

### Key integration use cases

Zapier connects Tallyfy with thousands of apps. Here are patterns that work well:

#### 1. CRM-triggered onboarding

A deal closes in your CRM - then what?
- Tallyfy instantly [launches](/products/pro/launching/) your client onboarding [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)
- The right [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) get tasks assigned automatically
- Everyone sees real-time progress. No more "what's the status?" emails

#### 2. Scheduled process launches

Weekly reports? Monthly audits? Quarterly reviews?
- Set up time-based triggers in Zapier
- Tallyfy [launches](/products/pro/launching/) your [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) on schedule
- Never miss a recurring task again

#### 3. Communication-based task creation

Stop losing requests in email and Slack:
- Email to support@yourcompany.com? It becomes a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in Tallyfy
- Type #urgent in Slack? A [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) kicks off automatically
- Nothing falls through the cracks

#### 4. Web form tracking

Customer fills out a web form - then what?
- Form data flows straight into Tallyfy
- The right [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) [launches](/products/pro/launching/) based on request type
- You track everything from "submitted" to "done"
