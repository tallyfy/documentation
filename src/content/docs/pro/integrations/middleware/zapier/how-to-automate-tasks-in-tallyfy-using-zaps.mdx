## Automate task completion with Zaps

Zapier can automatically complete [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in Tallyfy when something happens in another app. This same approach works with other [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) platforms like Power Automate.

## How the flow works

```d2
direction: down

Trigger: "External Trigger\n(Email, Form, etc.)" {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#e6f3ff"
}

Check: "Have Task ID?" {
  shape: diamond
  style.fill: "#fff3cd"
}

Find: "Find Task\n(by template & name)" {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#ffe6e6"
}

Complete: "Complete Task\nAction" {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#e6ffe6"
}

API: "Tallyfy API" {
  shape: cylinder
  style.fill: "#f5f5f5"
}

Trigger -> Check: "1. Receive trigger\ndata" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
}

Check -> Find: "2a. No ID\n(need to search)" {
  style.stroke: "#666"
}

Check -> Complete: "2b. Has ID\n(skip search)" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
  style.stroke-width: 2
}

Find -> Complete: "3. Pass found\ntask details" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
}

Complete -> API: "4. Mark task\ncomplete" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
  style.stroke-width: 2
}

API -> API: "5. Update task\nstatus" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
}
```

Two things to note:
- If you don't already have the task ID, you'll need to find it first using a template ID plus either the process name or a kick-off field value
- Both paths end at the same "Complete Task" action that marks the task done through Tallyfy's API

:::note[Considering integration alternatives]
Zapier works for simple connections, but we'd generally recommend [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) platforms like **n8n**, **Make**, or **Microsoft Power Automate** for more serious integrations - they're more capable and cost-effective.

For full control, consider Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) to build custom integrations directly.
:::

Start by picking a trigger that can send custom data like a process name. If you already have the [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) ID, skip ahead to completing the task. Otherwise, find it first:

<Steps>
1. Create an action step, choose Tallyfy, and select "Find [Process Task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/)."

2. Pick the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) you want to search within. Your trigger can also pass the _Template ID_ dynamically.
3. In "Search By," choose whether to search by process name or KO Field (kick-off field).
4. Enter the search value. For process name searches, this must be the exact, full process name. For kick-off field searches, use the "Filter Value" field instead and pick the specific KO field from "Selected KO Field."
5. Choose which [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to target in the "Selected step" field. This value is the _task alias_ - your trigger can supply it dynamically.

</Steps>

Once you've found the [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), here's how to complete the [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/):

<Steps>
1. Add a new Tallyfy action step and select "Complete Task."
2. For both _Process ID_ and _Task ID_, select "Use a Custom Value," then pick the "Find Process Task" action and choose the matching ID field.
</Steps>

Here's a video walkthrough showing the full setup:

Keep in mind - if you test a zap that completes a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), you'll need to manually re-open that task in Tallyfy before you can test again.
