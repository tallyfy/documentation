## Step-by-step guide to mark tasks complete automatically

This article will guide you on how to automate [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in Tallyfy using Zaps or other [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) services like Power Automate.

:::note[Considering Integration Alternatives]
While Zapier can be useful for simple connections, we generally recommend more capable and cost-effective [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) solutions like **n8n**, **Make**, or **Microsoft Power Automate** for serious integrations.

For maximum control and flexibility, especially if you have development resources, consider using Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) to build custom integrations, potentially leveraging AI to generate code for serverless functions.
:::

To get started, you'll need to choose a trigger that allows for custom data to be sent, such as a process name.

If you already have the [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) ID, you can skip the process-finding step. Otherwise, follow these steps:

<Steps>
1. Create an action step, choose Tallyfy, and select "Find [Process Task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/)."

2. Enter the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) you wish to find the [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) for. Alternatively, you can have the template be decided by your trigger by sending the _Template ID_.
3. Use the "Search By" field to select whether to search for a process by name or by Kick Off field.
4. Use the "Search Value" field to set the process name to search for (must be the whole process name) and the "Filter Value" field to search by the Kick-Off field.
5. Use the "Selected Step" field to set which [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) to complete. This value can come from your trigger using the custom value option, but you must send a _task alias_.

</Steps>

Once you've found the [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), you can complete the [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) by following these steps:

<Steps>
1. Create a new Tallyfy action step and select "Mark [Process Task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) Complete."
2. You will need the _Process ID_ and _Task ID_ for the process task you wish to complete. These can be obtained by selecting "Use a Custom Value," then choosing the "Find Process Task" action, and selecting either _Process ID_ or _Task ID_.
</Steps>

If you prefer a video guide, watch this tutorial on setting up a zap that can mark a [process task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) complete:

Please note that if you test a zap that completes a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), you will need to manually re-open the task in Tallyfy.
