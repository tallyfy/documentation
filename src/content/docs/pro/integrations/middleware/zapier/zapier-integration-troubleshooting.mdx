## Troubleshooting Tallyfy-Zapier integration issues

The Tallyfy-Zapier integration allows you to connect Tallyfy with thousands of other applications. However, you may occasionally encounter issues that need troubleshooting. This guide helps you identify and resolve common Zapier integration problems.

### Connection issues

If you're having trouble connecting Tallyfy to Zapier:

#### Authentication problems

- **Invalid credentials**: Ensure you're using the correct Tallyfy email and password
- **Access permissions**: Verify you have administrator or standard member permissions in Tallyfy
- **Token expiration**: Reconnect your Tallyfy account in Zapier if your authentication token has expired

#### Connection setup issues

1. **Can't find Tallyfy app in Zapier**: 
   - Search for "Tallyfy" in the Zapier app directory
   - Ensure you're using the correct spelling
   - If still not visible, try navigating directly to [zapier.com/apps/tallyfy](https://zapier.com/apps/tallyfy)

2. **Connection timeout errors**:
   - Check your internet connection
   - Try connecting during non-peak hours
   - Contact Tallyfy support if the issue persists

### Trigger issues

Problems with Zapier triggers not firing when expected:

#### "New Task" trigger not working

- **Check webhook status**: Ensure webhooks are properly configured in Tallyfy
- **Verify task creation**: Confirm tasks are being created correctly in Tallyfy
- **Filter settings**: Check if you have filters that might be preventing the trigger from firing

#### "Task Completed" trigger not firing

- **Task status**: Verify the task was actually marked as complete in Tallyfy
- **Zap status**: Ensure your Zap is turned on in Zapier
- **Time delay**: Allow a few minutes for the trigger to process

#### "Process Launched" trigger issues

- **Launch confirmation**: Confirm the process was successfully launched in Tallyfy
- **Template changes**: Check if the process template has been modified recently
- **Permission issues**: Ensure the connected account has visibility to the launched process

### Action issues

Problems when Zapier tries to perform actions in Tallyfy:

#### "Launch Process" action failing

- **Template availability**: Verify the template ID exists and is active
- **Required fields**: Ensure all required launch parameters are provided
- **Formatting issues**: Check that dates and other special fields use the correct format

#### "Create Task" action not working

- **Assignment issues**: Confirm the assignee exists in Tallyfy
- **Field mapping**: Verify all required fields are properly mapped
- **Permission problems**: Ensure the connected account has permission to create tasks

#### Data mapping problems

- **Field type mismatch**: Ensure the data types match between Zapier and Tallyfy fields
- **Missing fields**: Check that all required fields are included in the mapping
- **Format errors**: Verify date formats, numbers, and text are properly formatted

### Advanced troubleshooting

For more complex integration issues:

#### Testing your Zap

1. Use Zapier's testing feature to debug each step individually
2. Check the task/process history in Tallyfy to verify expected behavior
3. Review the Zap history in Zapier to see detailed execution logs

#### Common error messages

| Error Message | Possible Cause | Solution |
|---------------|----------------|----------|
| "Authentication failed" | Invalid credentials | Reconnect your Tallyfy account |
| "Template not found" | Incorrect template ID | Verify the template ID exists |
| "User not found" | Incorrect assignee email | Check the email address is valid |
| "Access denied" | Insufficient permissions | Use an account with proper permissions |
| "Invalid field value" | Data formatting issue | Check field format requirements |

#### Logging and debugging

- Enable detailed logging in Zapier to capture more information
- Use the "Debug" step in Zapier to inspect data at each stage
- Monitor webhook delivery in Tallyfy's settings

### Best practices for Tallyfy-Zapier integration

To minimize integration issues:

- **Keep authentication fresh**: Reconnect your Tallyfy account periodically
- **Document your Zaps**: Keep notes on what each Zap does and how it's configured
- **Test thoroughly**: Test each Zap with various scenarios before relying on it
- **Monitor regularly**: Set up notifications for failed Zaps
- **Update carefully**: Test Zaps after making changes to Tallyfy templates
- **Use descriptive names**: Name your Zaps clearly to make troubleshooting easier
