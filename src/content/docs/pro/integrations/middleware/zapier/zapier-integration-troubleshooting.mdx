## Fix common Tallyfy-Zapier problems fast

Most Tallyfy-Zapier issues fall into three buckets: authentication failures, triggers that don't fire, or actions that error out. Here's how to fix each one.

:::caution[Tallyfy uses webhooks, not polling]
Tallyfy's Zapier connector fires webhook-based triggers instantly when events happen -- there's no 5-15 minute polling delay. This means triggers like "Task Completed" and "Process Started" should fire within seconds. If they don't, the problem is usually a configuration issue, not a timing one.
:::

### Connection and authentication issues

Tallyfy connects to Zapier through OAuth2. You'll authorize with your Tallyfy credentials, and the connector stores an `access_token`, `refresh_token`, and your `organization_id`. Token refresh is automatic -- you shouldn't need to reconnect often.

**If your connection fails:**

- **"Authentication failed"** -- Reconnect your Tallyfy account in Zapier. Go to **My Apps** > **Tallyfy** > **Reconnect**
- **Can't find Tallyfy in Zapier** -- Search for "Tallyfy" in the Zapier app directory, or go directly to [zapier.com/apps/tallyfy](https://zapier.com/apps/tallyfy)
- **"Invalid client" error** -- Your OAuth credentials are misconfigured. Disconnect and re-authorize through Zapier's connection flow. The OAuth token URL is `https://account.tallyfy.com/oauth/token`
- **Permission denied** -- Make sure your Tallyfy account has Admin or Standard member permissions. Light users and Guests can't authorize integrations

### Trigger problems

Tallyfy's Zapier connector includes two instant (webhook) triggers and several polling-based data triggers:

#### "Task Completed" trigger not firing

- Confirm the task was actually completed in Tallyfy, not just reopened or skipped
- Check that your Zap is turned **On** in Zapier's dashboard
- Verify the connected Tallyfy account has access to the organization where the task lives

#### "Process Started" trigger not firing

- Confirm the process actually launched successfully in Tallyfy
- Check if the template was modified after you set up the Zap -- template changes can break field mappings
- Make sure the connected account can see the process

### Action errors

The connector supports actions like launching processes, completing tasks, adding comments, changing assignees, and changing deadlines.

#### "Start Process" action failing

- **Template ID wrong** -- Copy the template ID directly from Tallyfy. If you renamed or duplicated the template, the old ID won't work
- **Missing kick-off form fields** -- If your template has required kick-off form fields, you must map values for every required field
- **Date formatting** -- Tallyfy expects UTC timestamps. If you're passing dates from another app, make sure they're formatted correctly

#### "Standalone Task" or "Process Task Complete" action failing

- **Assignee doesn't exist** -- The email address must belong to a member or guest in your Tallyfy organization
- **Guest-only assignments** -- Tallyfy won't let you assign a task exclusively to guests. If all assignees are guests, the connector automatically adds the connected user as a co-assignee
- **Required form fields empty** -- If the task has required form fields, fill them before completing it

### Field mapping tips

Bad field names in Tallyfy cause confusing dropdowns in Zapier. Name your fields specifically:

| Bad name | Better name |
|----------|-------------|
| Notes | Customer_Requirements_Notes |
| Comments | Customer_Service_Comments |
| Date | Contract_Start_Date |
| Address | Billing_Address |
| Name | Client_Name |

Avoid special characters in field names -- stick to letters, numbers, and underscores. If a field name appears in multiple steps, use identical names so Zapier can map them consistently.

### Common error messages

| Error message | Cause | Fix |
|---------------|-------|-----|
| "Authentication failed" | Expired or invalid OAuth token | Reconnect your Tallyfy account in Zapier |
| "Invalid client" | OAuth misconfiguration | Disconnect and re-authorize through Zapier |
| "Template not found" | Wrong template ID or deleted template | Copy the correct ID from Tallyfy |
| "User not found" | Invalid assignee email | Verify the email belongs to an org member or guest |
| "Access denied" | Insufficient account permissions | Use an Admin or Standard member account |
| "Invalid field value" | Wrong data type or format | Check that dates, numbers, and text match expected formats |

### Debugging steps

1. **Test each Zap step** -- Use Zapier's built-in test feature to run each step individually and inspect the output
2. **Check Zap history** -- Go to your Zap's history tab to see detailed execution logs, including error responses from Tallyfy's API
3. **Verify in Tallyfy** -- Check the task or process directly in Tallyfy to confirm it's in the expected state

### Getting help
