## Setting up recurring monthly workflows in 5 steps

Automating [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) in Tallyfy can save time and effort. This guide explains how to automatically [launch a process](/products/pro/launching/) on the 1st of every month using Zapier.

:::note[Considering Integration Alternatives]
While Zapier can be useful for simple connections, we generally recommend more capable and cost-effective [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) solutions like **n8n**, **Make**, or **Microsoft Power Automate** for serious integrations.

For maximum control and flexibility, especially if you have development resources, consider using Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) to build custom integrations, potentially leveraging AI to generate code for serverless functions.

To get started, follow these steps:

<Steps>
1. Select the "schedule" trigger in Zapier.
