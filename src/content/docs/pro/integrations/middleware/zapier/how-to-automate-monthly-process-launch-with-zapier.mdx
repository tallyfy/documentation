## Automate monthly process launches with Zapier

Tallyfy can automatically [launch processes](/products/pro/launching/) every month through Zapier's schedule trigger. It takes about 5 minutes to set up, and you won't have to remember to kick off monthly reporting, reviews, or any other recurring workflow again.

:::note[Why consider alternative integration platforms?]
Zapier handles basic connections well, but for business-critical integrations we'd recommend [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) platforms like **n8n**, **Make**, or **Microsoft Power Automate** - they're more capable and cost-effective.

If you've got developers, Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) lets you build custom integrations directly.

<Steps>
1. Pick the **Schedule** trigger in Zapier.
