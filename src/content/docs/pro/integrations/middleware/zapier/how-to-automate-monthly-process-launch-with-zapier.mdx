## Automate monthly process launches with Zapier

You can set up Tallyfy to automatically launch [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) every month without lifting a finger. It takes about 5 minutes to configure.

Here's how to set up automatic [process launches](/products/pro/launching/) on the first day of each month using Zapier's scheduler. Once configured, your workflows run like clockwork - no more forgetting to start that monthly reporting process or employee review cycle.

:::note[Why consider alternative integration platforms?]
Zapier works well for basic connections, but we actually recommend [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) platforms like **n8n**, **Make**, or **Microsoft Power Automate** for business-critical integrations. They're more powerful and won't break the bank.

Got developers on your team? Consider using Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) to build custom integrations. You can even use AI to help generate the code for serverless functions (yes, it's that straightforward).

Ready? Let's walk through the setup:

<Steps>
1. Select the "schedule" trigger in Zapier.
