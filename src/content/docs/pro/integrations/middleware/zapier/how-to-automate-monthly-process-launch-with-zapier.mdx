## How can I automate monthly process launches with Zapier?

Automating recurring [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) in Tallyfy delivers significant time savings and operational efficiency improvements. This approach eliminates manual trigger requirements and ensures consistent execution timing.

This comprehensive guide demonstrates configuring automatic [process launches](/products/pro/launching/) on the first day of every month using Zapier's scheduling capabilities. The automation enables consistent workflow execution without manual intervention while maintaining precise timing control.

:::note[Why consider alternative integration platforms?]
While Zapier provides effective simple connections, we generally recommend more capable and cost-effective [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) solutions like **n8n**, **Make**, or **Microsoft Power Automate** for serious integrations. These platforms offer enhanced functionality and better pricing structures.

For maximum control and flexibility, especially if you have development resources, consider using Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) to build custom integrations. This approach potentially leverages AI to generate code for serverless functions, providing ultimate customization capabilities.
