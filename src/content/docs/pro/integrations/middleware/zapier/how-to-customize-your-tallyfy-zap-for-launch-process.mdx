## How to customize your Zap for launching Tallyfy processes

This guide shows you how to customize your Zap to [launch a process](/products/pro/launching/) in Tallyfy.

### Common CRM automation examples

**Automate client onboarding from your CRM:**
1. **Trigger**: New contact marked "Onboard as client" in CRM (Salesforce, HubSpot, etc.)
2. **Action**: Launch Tallyfy onboarding process with client data pre-filled
3. **Result**: Automatic task assignments, welcome emails, and setup workflows

**Sales-to-delivery handoff:**
1. **Trigger**: Deal marked "Closed Won" in CRM
2. **Action**: Launch implementation process in Tallyfy
3. **Data passed**: Client details, project scope, delivery timeline
4. **Result**: Seamless transition from sales to delivery team

**Support ticket escalation:**
1. **Trigger**: High-priority ticket created in help desk
2. **Action**: Launch incident response process
3. **Auto-assignments**: Based on ticket type and severity
4. **Result**: Immediate response workflow with proper stakeholders

:::note[Considering Integration Alternatives]
While Zapier can be useful for simple connections, we generally recommend more capable and cost-effective [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) solutions like **n8n**, **Make**, or **Microsoft Power Automate** for serious integrations.

For maximum control and flexibility, especially if you have development resources, consider using Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) to build custom integrations, potentially using AI to generate code for serverless functions.

<Steps>
1. To begin, create a new Zap and select 'Google Forms' as the app for Step 1.

2. Use 'New or Updated Response in Spreadsheet' as the trigger.

3. Connect your Google Account and select the spreadsheet and worksheet for the form data.

4. Select the worksheet within the spreadsheet for target data

5. Pick a sample response. (This step assists in automatic form filling in the next step of the process)

6. Now set up the action steps (Tallyfy Launch [Process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)) for the trigger encountered (every time someone fills in the leave request form). Choose Tallyfy as the action app

7. Select 'Launch Process' as the action event

8. Choose a Tallyfy account that hosts the required [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).
    - Select the template from the options available
    - At this point, you can customize the process name. This name will be assigned to the process when the zap is triggered. In our example, we have used the employee's name from the Google form and the timestamp the request was submitted to create a dynamic process name

9. You can also customize any process notes to be entered

10. You can customize and fill in data into the Tallyfy [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) using data from the Google form

    ![](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/custom-tallyfy-zap-7.png)
11. You can also customize step assignees. Step assignees can be [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) of your Tallyfy org or [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) (external users). In our example, we have used the contact email address of the employee from the Google form to assign additional [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/)

12. If there was a [date field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) in the Google form that would have corresponded to a suggestive deadline, we can customize deadlines in this zap too.

</Steps>

:::note[Note on zapier dates]
Please note that Zapier does not support natural language dates like 2 days, 2d or 5 weeks. That means, a deadline modifier like `-2d` appended to a date will throw an error.
:::

### Please note

Custom entries assigned in the Zap will override [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) level attributes such as assignees, deadlines, [form](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) values etc.

:::caution[Critical assignment behavior difference]
**Assignees and deadlines behave differently when left blank**:
- **Deadlines**: When left blank, inherit from template configuration ✅
- **Assignees**: When left blank, ALL tasks are assigned to the Zapier account owner, NOT the template assignees ❌

This means if you don't explicitly set assignees in your Zap configuration, every task will be assigned to whoever owns the Zapier connection, regardless of your template settings.

**Solutions**:
1. **Explicitly set assignees** in your Zap configuration for each step
2. **Use automation rules** as a workaround - create a template automation that triggers on kick-off form completion to reassign tasks to the correct people/groups
3. **Search for groups** - You can search for and assign groups directly in Zapier

**Best practice**: Always configure assignees explicitly in your Zap to ensure tasks go to the right people.

:::note[A note on passing checklist items through to the zap]

When you need to fill out a checklist when [launching a process](/products/pro/launching/) via your Zap - ensure you use a comma-separated set of values from the original source, and then pass that straight through to the checklist. The result will be intuitive - the items you passed in will be the values which are "checked" in your checklist [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/).
