## Setting up the Launch Process action in Zapier

The Zapier "Launch Process" action lets you automatically [launch a Tallyfy process](/products/pro/launching/) whenever a trigger fires - like a Google Forms submission, a CRM deal closing, or a support ticket arriving.

### Example use cases

- **CRM onboarding** - A new contact in Salesforce or HubSpot triggers a Tallyfy onboarding process with client data pre-filled.
- **Sales-to-delivery handoff** - A deal marked "Closed Won" launches an implementation process, passing client details and timeline straight through.
- **Support escalation** - A high-priority ticket spins up an incident response process with the right people assigned.

:::note[Consider other middleware options]
Zapier works for simple connections, but we generally recommend [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) like **n8n**, **Make**, or **Microsoft Power Automate** for more capable, cost-effective integrations. If you've got development resources, Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) gives you full control.

<Steps>
1. Create a new Zap and pick your trigger app (Google Forms in this example).

2. Choose 'New or Updated Response in Spreadsheet' as the trigger event.

3. Connect your Google account and select the spreadsheet with your form data.

4. Pick the worksheet that holds the target data.

5. Select a sample response - Zapier uses this to auto-populate fields in later steps.

6. Add an action step and choose **Tallyfy** as the app.

7. Select **Launch Process** as the action event.

8. Pick your Tallyfy account and choose the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) you want to launch. You can build a dynamic process name here - for example, combining the employee's name and submission timestamp from the Google form.

9. Optionally add process notes.

10. Map trigger data into the Tallyfy [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) kick-off form fields.

11. Set step assignees. These can be [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) of your org or [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) (external email addresses). You can also search for and assign groups directly in Zapier.

12. Map any date fields from the trigger to set [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) deadlines.

</Steps>

:::note[Zapier date format]
Zapier doesn't support natural language dates like `2 days`, `2d`, or `5 weeks`. A deadline modifier like `-2d` appended to a date will throw an error - you need to pass actual date values.

### How Zap values interact with template defaults

Any value you set in the Zap overrides the corresponding [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) setting - including assignees, deadlines, and [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) values.

:::caution[Assignee behavior when fields are blank]
**Deadlines and assignees behave differently when you don't fill them in:**
- **Deadlines left blank** - the template's default deadline applies.
- **Assignees left blank** - Tallyfy's middleware sends the request with `override_default_owners=true`, which means the API receives an empty assignee list. In practice, the API falls back to template assignees when the provided list is empty, but results can be unpredictable depending on template configuration.

**What to do:**
1. **Set assignees explicitly** in your Zap for each step - this is the safest approach.
2. **Use automation rules** on your template to reassign tasks after launch if needed.
3. **Assign groups** - you can search for and assign Tallyfy groups directly in the Zap.
:::

:::note[Passing checklist values]
To fill out a checklist [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) when [launching a process](/products/pro/launching/) via Zapier, pass comma-separated values from your trigger source. The items you pass become the "checked" entries in the checklist.
