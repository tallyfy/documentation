title: Why use middleware?
---

## Why should you use middleware platforms instead of custom API code?

Integration platforms beat custom API code 9 times out of 10. When you need to connect Tallyfy to other software your business uses, middleware tools like Zapier, Make, or Power Automate save you months of development time - and headaches down the road.

### What does an integration platform do?

Picture a universal translator sitting between Tallyfy and your other apps. That's middleware. Here's what you get:

- Ready-made connections to hundreds of popular apps
- Tools to transform data from Tallyfy's format to another app's format
- Automatic error handling when connections fail temporarily
- Monitoring dashboards to watch your connections
- Visual interfaces - no code required (usually)

The big players? Microsoft Power Automate, Zapier, Make.com, and Workato.

:::note[Choosing a Tool - Reminder]
Zapier works fine for basic stuff. But if you're building something serious, **Make.com** or **Microsoft Power Automate** handle complex logic better. Developers who want complete control should check out Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/).

### Key reasons to use middleware

#### 1. Less Hassle with Updates

APIs change constantly - that's just reality. With middleware, you're protected:

- **Less work for you**: When Tallyfy or another app updates its API, the middleware company fixes their connector. Not your problem anymore.
- **Stays compatible**: The platform handles different API versions behind the scenes
- **Ongoing support**: Your connections keep working as apps evolve

#### 2. Faster Setup with Pre-Built Connectors

Why reinvent the wheel? Middleware gets you running in minutes:

- **Huge libraries**: Access 1,000+ ready-to-use connectors for popular apps
- **Tested connections**: These connectors are battle-tested by thousands of users
- **Configure, don't code**: Click, configure, done. No coding marathons required.

#### 3. More Ways to Start Workflows

Need flexibility? You've got it:

- **Many trigger types**: Time-based, data-driven, or event-triggered - take your pick
- **Smart triggers**: Add filters and logic to control exactly when connections fire
- **Multi-app triggers**: Watch several apps at once and coordinate complex workflows

#### 4. Built-in Tools You Don't Have to Build

Here's the boring stuff that middleware handles so you don't have to:

- **Error handling**: Connection drops? The platform retries automatically
- **Data transformation**: Split names, reformat dates, clean messy data - all built in
- **Monitoring**: Real-time logs show exactly what happened (and when things break)
- **Security**: Login credentials stored safely, connections managed properly

### Recommended approach

Got some custom requirements? No problem. Here's the smart way to handle them:

1. Build your main connection flow **inside** the middleware platform first
2. Add small custom code snippets only where you absolutely need them
3. Let the platform handle all the error handling, monitoring, and maintenance

You get the flexibility of custom code without the headache of maintaining everything yourself. Best of both worlds.

### Which platform to choose?

Each platform has its sweet spot:

- **Microsoft Power Automate**: Already using Microsoft 365? This integrates seamlessly.
- **Zapier**: Dead simple to start with. Perfect for your first automation.
- **Make.com**: When you need complex data transformations and branching logic
- **Workato**: Enterprise-grade with all the bells and whistles (and the price tag to match)
