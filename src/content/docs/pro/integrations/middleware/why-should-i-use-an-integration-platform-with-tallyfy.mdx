title: Why use middleware?

## Why use middleware platforms instead of custom API code?

Middleware tools like Zapier, Make, or Power Automate beat custom API code for most Tallyfy integrations. They save you development time - and ongoing maintenance headaches.

### What does an integration platform do?

Think of middleware as a universal translator between Tallyfy and your other apps. You get:

- Ready-made connections to hundreds of popular apps
- Data transformation between Tallyfy's format and other apps
- Automatic error handling and retries when connections fail
- Monitoring dashboards for all your connections
- Visual interfaces - no code required (usually)

Tallyfy has built connectors for Microsoft Power Automate, Zapier, Make.com, and Workato.

:::note[Choosing a tool]
Zapier works fine for basic automations. For complex logic, **Make.com** or **Microsoft Power Automate** are stronger choices. Developers who want full control should check out Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/).

### Key reasons to use middleware

#### 1. Less hassle with updates

APIs change constantly. With middleware, you're protected:

- **Less work for you**: When Tallyfy updates its API, the middleware company fixes their connector - not your problem anymore
- **Version handling**: The platform manages API version differences behind the scenes
- **Ongoing support**: Your connections keep working as apps evolve

#### 2. Faster setup with pre-built connectors

Middleware gets you running in minutes instead of days:

- **Large libraries**: Hundreds of ready-to-use connectors for popular apps
- **Tested connections**: These connectors are battle-tested by thousands of users
- **Configure, don't code**: Click, configure, done. No coding required.

#### 3. More ways to start workflows

- **Many trigger types**: Time-based, data-driven, or event-triggered - take your pick
- **Smart triggers**: Add filters and logic to control exactly when connections fire
- **Multi-app triggers**: Watch several apps at once and coordinate actions across them

#### 4. Built-in tools you don't have to build

Here's what middleware handles so you don't have to:

- **Error handling**: Connection drops? The platform retries automatically
- **Data transformation**: Split names, reformat dates, clean messy data - all built in
- **Monitoring**: Real-time logs show exactly what happened (and when things break)
- **Security**: Credentials stored safely, connections managed properly

### Recommended approach

If you have custom requirements, here's the smart way to handle them:

1. Build your main connection flow **inside** the middleware platform first
2. Add small custom code snippets only where you absolutely need them
3. Let the platform handle error handling, monitoring, and maintenance

You get the flexibility of custom code without maintaining everything yourself.

### Which platform to choose?

Each platform has its sweet spot:

- **Microsoft Power Automate**: Already using Microsoft 365? This integrates directly.
- **Zapier**: Dead simple to start with. Good for your first automation.
- **Make.com**: Best for complex data transformations and branching logic.
- **Workato**: Enterprise-grade features for larger organizations.
