## Benefits of Integration Platforms with Tallyfy

When connecting Tallyfy to other business systems, using a dedicated integration platform (middleware) provides advantages over direct API integration. This article explains why middleware is the recommended approach for most integration scenarios.

### What is an integration platform?

An integration platform sits between Tallyfy and other applications, providing:

- Pre-built connectors to hundreds of applications
- Data transformation capabilities
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Logging and monitoring tools
- Visual workflow builders

Common integration platforms that work well with Tallyfy include Microsoft Power Automate, Zapier, Make.com, and Workato.

:::note[Considering Integration Alternatives]
While Zapier can be useful for simple connections, we generally recommend more capable and cost-effective middleware solutions like **n8n**, **Make**, or **Microsoft Power Automate** for serious integrations.

For maximum control and flexibility, especially if you have development resources, consider using Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) to build custom integrations, potentially leveraging AI to generate code for serverless functions.

### Key advantages

#### 1. Automatic updates and maintenance

Integration platforms handle API changes automatically:

- **Reduced maintenance burden** - When third-party APIs change, the platform provider updates the connectors
- **Version compatibility** - Middleware manages API version differences between systems
- **Ongoing support** - Platform providers maintain connectivity as systems evolve

#### 2. Pre-built connectors

Save development time with ready-to-use integration components:

- **Extensive connector libraries** - Hundreds of pre-built application connectors
- **Platform-tested** - Platform-provided connectors are tested by the vendor
- **Faster implementation** - Configure rather than code most integration points

#### 3. Advanced triggering capabilities

Enable event-based automation:

- **Diverse trigger types** - Time-based, data-based, or external event triggers
- **Complex conditions** - Apply filtering and conditional logic to triggers
- **Cross-application events** - Trigger workflows based on events in multiple systems

#### 4. Built-in integration infrastructure

Eliminate the need to build integration foundations:

- **Error handling** - Automatic retry mechanisms for failed connections
- **Transformation tools** - Data mapping and format conversion capabilities
- **Monitoring** - Built-in logging and alerting for integration health
- **Security** - Authentication management and secure credential storage

### Implementation approach

Even when custom logic is required, we recommend:

1. Build the integration **within** an integration platform
2. Use the platform's custom code capabilities where needed
3. Leverage the platform's infrastructure for maintenance and monitoring

This approach provides the flexibility of custom development while maintaining the advantages of a managed integration platform.
