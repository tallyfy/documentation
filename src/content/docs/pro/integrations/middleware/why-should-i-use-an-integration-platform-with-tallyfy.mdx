## Why use an integration platform (middleware) with Tallyfy?

When you want to connect Tallyfy to other software your business uses, using an integration platform (also called middleware, like Zapier, Make, or Power Automate) is usually better than trying to build a direct connection using code (API integration). Here's why:

### What does an integration platform do?

Think of it as a universal translator and connector sitting between Tallyfy and your other apps. It provides:

- Ready-made connections to hundreds of popular apps.
- Tools to change data from Tallyfy's format to another app's format.
- Ways to automatically handle errors if a connection fails.
- Tools to watch if the connections are working.
- Often, a visual way to build the connection without code.

Common tools include Microsoft Power Automate, Zapier, Make.com, and Workato.

:::note[Choosing a Tool - Reminder]
Zapier is okay for simple things. For more serious connections, **Make.com** or **Microsoft Power Automate** are often better choices. Developers needing full control can use Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/).

### Key reasons to use middleware

#### 1. Less Hassle with Updates

Software APIs (the way programs talk to each other) change over time. Middleware handles this for you:

- **Less work for you**: When Tallyfy or another app updates its API, the middleware company updates their connector, not you.
- **Stays compatible**: The middleware deals with different API versions.
- **Ongoing support**: The platform keeps the connections working as apps evolve.

#### 2. Faster Setup with Pre-Built Connectors

Middleware saves development time:

- **Huge libraries**: Access hundreds or thousands of ready-to-use connectors for common apps.
- **Tested connections**: The middleware company usually tests these connectors.
- **Configure, don't code**: Set up most connections by clicking and configuring, not writing code.

#### 3. More Ways to Start Workflows

Middleware offers flexible ways to trigger your connections:

- **Many trigger types**: Start based on time, new data, or events in other apps.
- **Smart triggers**: Use filters or logic to decide exactly when the connection should run.
- **Multi-app triggers**: Start a workflow based on things happening in several different apps.

#### 4. Built-in Tools You Don't Have to Build

Middleware provides essential plumbing for integrations:

- **Error handling**: Automatically retry if a data transfer fails temporarily.
- **Data transformation**: Tools to easily change data format (e.g., split names, reformat dates).
- **Monitoring**: See logs of what happened and get alerts if things break.
- **Security**: Manage connections and store login details securely.

### Recommended approach

Even if you need some custom code for a specific part of your integration, it's usually best to:

1. Build the main connection flow **inside** the middleware platform.
2. Use the platform's features for adding small bits of custom code if absolutely necessary.
3. Rely on the platform for the error handling, monitoring, and maintenance.

This gives you the power of custom code where needed, without losing the benefits of the middleware platform handling the basics.

### Which platform to choose?

Consider these based on your needs:

- **Microsoft Power Automate**: Best if you heavily use Microsoft 365.
- **Zapier**: Good for simple connections, easy to start.
- **Make.com**: Powerful for complex data changes and logic.
- **Workato**: Aimed at large companies with many complex integrations.
