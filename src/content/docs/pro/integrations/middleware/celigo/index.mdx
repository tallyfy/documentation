## Planned Celigo integration for Tallyfy workflows

:::note[Coming Soon]
Tallyfy is planning to build a native Celigo connector. This integration is not yet available but is on our roadmap. Contact [Tallyfy support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/) to express interest or get updates on availability.
:::

Celigo's integrator.io platform specializes in connecting enterprise systems - particularly NetSuite, Salesforce, and other business applications. Once available, the Tallyfy connector for Celigo will enable organizations to automate complex workflows that span multiple systems, bringing process management capabilities to your existing Celigo integration flows.

### How the Tallyfy-Celigo connector will work

The planned integration will leverage Celigo's universal HTTP connector architecture and API management capabilities to create bidirectional data flows between Tallyfy and your other business systems.

**Key integration patterns we're designing:**

1. **Process triggers from business events** - Sales orders in NetSuite automatically launch approval workflows in Tallyfy
2. **Task completion webhooks** - Completed Tallyfy tasks update records in connected systems through Celigo flows
3. **Data synchronization** - Keep process data synchronized across Tallyfy, your ERP, CRM, and other platforms
4. **Automated assignments** - Use Celigo's data transformations to dynamically assign Tallyfy tasks based on business rules

### Planned connector capabilities

Our Celigo connector will support these core functions:

**Process automation:**
- Launch Tallyfy processes from any Celigo-connected application
- Trigger processes based on business events (new customer, order threshold, contract renewal)
- Pass data from source systems into Tallyfy kick-off forms
- Handle complex conditional logic using Celigo's flow builder

**Task management:**
- Complete tasks programmatically when conditions are met in other systems
- Reassign tasks based on workload or availability data
- Update task form fields with data from integrated applications
- Create comments and track issues across platforms

**Data operations:**
- Export process metrics to data warehouses through Celigo
- Synchronize master data between Tallyfy and business systems
- Transform data formats using Celigo's mapping capabilities
- Maintain audit trails across all connected applications

### Architecture overview

The connector will utilize Celigo's SmartConnector framework:

```
Your Systems → Celigo Platform → Tallyfy API
    ↓              ↓                  ↓
NetSuite      Data Transform    Process Launch
Salesforce    Field Mapping     Task Updates
Shopify       Error Handling    Data Export
Custom Apps   Retry Logic       Webhooks
```

**Authentication approach:**
- OAuth 2.0 bearer tokens for secure API access
- Encrypted credential storage in Celigo's platform
- Support for multiple Tallyfy organizations
- Rate limit management and automatic retries

### Implementation scenarios

**Order-to-fulfillment workflow:**
When a high-value order enters NetSuite, Celigo triggers a Tallyfy approval process. The process routes through finance review, credit check, and management approval. Each approval in Tallyfy updates the order status in NetSuite through Celigo's bidirectional sync.

**Employee onboarding automation:**
New employee records in your HRIS system trigger comprehensive onboarding processes in Tallyfy. Celigo orchestrates data flow between HR systems, IT provisioning tools, and Tallyfy's task management - ensuring nothing falls through the cracks.

**Customer escalation handling:**
Support tickets reaching priority thresholds in your CRM automatically launch Tallyfy escalation workflows. Celigo maintains synchronization between ticket status, Tallyfy task progress, and customer communication platforms.

### Building custom integrations today

While waiting for the native connector, you can still integrate Tallyfy with Celigo using these approaches:

**Universal HTTP connector:**
1. Create a new HTTP connection in Celigo
2. Configure authentication using Tallyfy API tokens
3. Map Tallyfy's REST endpoints for processes and tasks
4. Build flows using Celigo's visual interface

**Webhook intermediary pattern:**
1. Set up Tallyfy webhooks to send events to a middleware endpoint
2. Configure Celigo to poll or receive these events
3. Process events through Celigo flows to update connected systems
4. Use Celigo's API management to create reusable integration endpoints

**Required Tallyfy API endpoints:**
- `POST /api/v1/processes` - Launch new processes
- `GET /api/v1/tasks` - Retrieve task details
- `PUT /api/v1/tasks/{id}` - Update task status
- `POST /api/v1/webhooks` - Configure event notifications

### Technical requirements

To prepare for the Celigo integration:

**Tallyfy configuration:**
- API access enabled in your Tallyfy organization
- Webhook endpoints configured for relevant events
- Process templates designed with integration fields
- User permissions set for system accounts

**Celigo platform setup:**
- integrator.io account with appropriate licensing
- Universal connector permissions enabled
- API rate limits configured for Tallyfy endpoints
- Error handling and alerting rules defined

### Why Celigo for workflow automation

Celigo brings unique strengths to process automation:

- **Pre-built connectors** - 200+ applications already integrated
- **Enterprise scale** - Handles millions of transactions daily
- **Error recovery** - Automatic detection and resolution of data issues
- **Visual flow builder** - No-code integration design for business users

Combined with Tallyfy's process management, you get end-to-end automation across your entire technology stack.

### Getting notified about availability

The Tallyfy-Celigo connector is under development. To get early access or provide input on features:

1. Contact [Tallyfy support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/) to join the beta list
2. Share your specific use cases and integration requirements
3. Provide feedback on the planned capabilities outlined above

We're particularly interested in hearing about:
- Your current Celigo integrations that could benefit from workflow automation
- Specific data fields you need to synchronize
- Volume and frequency of process launches you anticipate
- Complex routing rules or conditional logic requirements
