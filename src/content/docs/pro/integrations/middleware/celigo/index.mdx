## Connecting Tallyfy with Celigo

:::note[No native connector yet]
There's no official Tallyfy connector in Celigo's marketplace. You can build custom integrations today using Celigo's universal HTTP connector and Tallyfy's REST API. Contact [Tallyfy support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/) if you need OAuth credentials for this purpose.
:::

Celigo's integrator.io platform connects enterprise systems - particularly NetSuite, Salesforce, and other business applications. You can use it to create data flows between Tallyfy and your other systems through Tallyfy's REST API.

### What you can do with a Celigo-Tallyfy integration

Typical integration patterns include:

1. **Trigger processes from business events** - a sales order in NetSuite launches an approval workflow in Tallyfy
2. **Sync task completions** - completed Tallyfy tasks update records in connected systems through Celigo flows
3. **Keep data in sync** - process data stays current across Tallyfy, your ERP, CRM, and other platforms
4. **Automate assignments** - use Celigo's data transformations to assign Tallyfy tasks based on business rules

### Building a custom integration

Since there's no native connector, you'll use Celigo's universal HTTP connector to call Tallyfy's API directly.

**Steps to connect:**
1. Create a new HTTP connection in Celigo
2. Configure authentication using a Tallyfy API token or OAuth 2.0 credentials
3. Map Tallyfy's REST API endpoints for templates (called "checklists" in the API) and processes (called "runs" in the API)
4. Build flows using Celigo's visual interface

**Key Tallyfy API endpoints you'll use:**

All endpoints are scoped to an organization: `/organizations/{org_id}/...`

- `GET .../checklists` - list available process templates
- `POST .../runs` - launch a new process from a template
- `GET .../runs/{run_id}/tasks` - get tasks in a running process
- `POST .../tasks` - create standalone tasks
- `PUT .../runs/{run_id}/tasks/{task_id}` - update or complete a task

**API terminology mapping:**
- "Templates" in the UI = "Checklists" in the API
- "Processes" in the UI = "Runs" in the API

### Authentication options

**Personal access token** - the quickest way to start. Navigate to Settings > Integrations > REST API in Tallyfy and copy your token. It acts on behalf of your user account.

**OAuth 2.0** - better for production integrations where multiple users authorize access. Contact Tallyfy support to get a Client ID and Client Secret. Tallyfy supports OAuth 2.0 bearer tokens with refresh capability.

### Example scenarios

**Order-to-fulfillment:** A high-value order in NetSuite triggers a Tallyfy approval process through Celigo. Each approval step in Tallyfy updates the order status back in NetSuite.

**Employee onboarding:** New employee records in your HRIS trigger onboarding processes in Tallyfy. Celigo moves data between HR systems, IT provisioning tools, and Tallyfy tasks.

**Customer escalation:** Support tickets hitting priority thresholds in your CRM launch escalation workflows in Tallyfy through Celigo flows.

### Celigo developer program

Celigo lets third-party developers create and publish connectors through their developer program. If you want to build a reusable Tallyfy connector, you can:

- Enroll in Celigo's Third-Party Developer Program
- Build custom integration apps using Tallyfy's REST API
- Package and publish solutions to Celigo's marketplace
- Go through Celigo's certification process for marketplace listing

### Requirements

**On the Tallyfy side:**
- API access enabled for your organization
- REST API token or OAuth credentials
- Process templates ready with the fields you want to populate

**On the Celigo side:**
- integrator.io account with appropriate licensing
- Universal connector permissions enabled
- Error handling and retry rules configured
