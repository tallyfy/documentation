## Planned Celigo integration for Tallyfy workflows

:::note[Coming Soon - Developer Preview Available]
Tallyfy's native Celigo connector is under active development. While not yet available in Celigo's marketplace, developers can build custom integrations today using Celigo's developer program and Tallyfy's REST API. Contact [Tallyfy support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/) to join our beta program or get early access credentials.

Celigo's integrator.io platform specializes in connecting enterprise systems - particularly NetSuite, Salesforce, and other business applications. Celigo added initial Tallyfy connector support in their 2023.5.1 release, providing basic API operations. The upcoming native connector will expand these capabilities, enabling organizations to automate complex workflows that span multiple systems with full process management integration.

### How the Tallyfy-Celigo connector will work

The planned integration will leverage Celigo's universal HTTP connector architecture and API management capabilities to create bidirectional data flows between Tallyfy and your other business systems.

**Key integration patterns we're designing:**

1. **Process triggers from business events** - Sales orders in NetSuite automatically launch approval workflows in Tallyfy
2. **Task completion webhooks** - Completed Tallyfy tasks update records in connected systems through Celigo flows
3. **Data synchronization** - Keep process data synchronized across Tallyfy, your ERP, CRM, and other platforms
4. **Automated assignments** - Use Celigo's data transformations to dynamically assign Tallyfy tasks based on business rules

### Planned connector capabilities

Our Celigo connector will support these core functions:

**Process automation:**
- Launch Tallyfy processes from any Celigo-connected application
- Trigger processes based on business events (new customer, order threshold, contract renewal)
- Pass data from source systems into Tallyfy kick-off forms
- Handle complex conditional logic using Celigo's flow builder

**Task management:**
- Complete tasks programmatically when conditions are met in other systems
- Reassign tasks based on workload or availability data
- Update task form fields with data from integrated applications
- Create comments and track issues across platforms

**Data operations:**
- Export process metrics to data warehouses through Celigo
- Synchronize master data between Tallyfy and business systems
- Transform data formats using Celigo's mapping capabilities
- Maintain audit trails across all connected applications

### Architecture overview

The connector will utilize Celigo's SmartConnector framework:

```
Your Systems → Celigo Platform → Tallyfy API
    ↓              ↓                  ↓
NetSuite      Data Transform    Process Launch
Salesforce    Field Mapping     Task Updates
Shopify       Error Handling    Data Export
Custom Apps   Retry Logic       Webhooks
```

**Authentication approach:**
- OAuth 2.0 bearer tokens for secure API access
- Encrypted credential storage in Celigo's platform
- Support for multiple Tallyfy organizations
- Rate limit management and automatic retries

### Implementation scenarios

**Order-to-fulfillment workflow:**
When a high-value order enters NetSuite, Celigo triggers a Tallyfy approval process. The process routes through finance review, credit check, and management approval. Each approval in Tallyfy updates the order status in NetSuite through Celigo's bidirectional sync.

**Employee onboarding automation:**
New employee records in your HRIS system trigger comprehensive onboarding processes in Tallyfy. Celigo orchestrates data flow between HR systems, IT provisioning tools, and Tallyfy's task management - ensuring nothing falls through the cracks.

**Customer escalation handling:**
Support tickets reaching priority thresholds in your CRM automatically launch Tallyfy escalation workflows. Celigo maintains synchronization between ticket status, Tallyfy task progress, and customer communication platforms.

### Practical implementation examples

**Creating a task via Celigo:**
```javascript
// Celigo flow configuration for task creation
{
  "operation": "create_task",
  "connection": "tallyfy_oauth",
  "mapping": {
    "name": "{{source.task_title}}",
    "description": "{{source.task_description}}",
    "assignee": "{{source.assigned_user}}",
    "due_date": "{{source.deadline}}"
  }
}
```

**Launching a process from external trigger:**
```javascript
// Trigger Tallyfy process when CRM opportunity closes
{
  "operation": "create_process",
  "blueprint_id": "customer_onboarding_v2",
  "kickoff_data": {
    "customer_name": "{{crm.account_name}}",
    "contract_value": "{{crm.deal_amount}}",
    "start_date": "{{crm.close_date}}"
  }
}
```

### Developer program and marketplace listing

Celigo enables third-party developers to create and publish connectors through their developer program. Once enrolled, you can:
- Access integration app development tools
- Build custom Tallyfy connectors using REST API
- Package and publish solutions to Celigo's marketplace
- Support OAuth 2.0 and token-based authentication
- Handle webhook events for real-time triggers

To get started, contact Celigo to enroll in their Third-Party Developer Program, which grants access to create and publish integration templates.

### Authentication options for developers

**Personal Access Token**:
- Quick development approach using user API tokens
- Navigate to Settings > Integrations > REST API in Tallyfy
- Copy your access token for immediate use
- Token acts on behalf of the user account

**OAuth 2.0 (Recommended for production)**:
- Best for public connectors with customer authorization
- Contact Tallyfy support for Client ID and Client Secret
- Supports granular permission scopes
- Handles token refresh automatically
- Encrypted credential storage in Celigo

### Building custom integrations today

While waiting for the native connector, you can integrate Tallyfy with Celigo using these approaches:

**Universal HTTP connector:**
1. Create a new HTTP connection in Celigo
2. Configure authentication using Tallyfy API tokens
3. Map Tallyfy's REST endpoints for processes and tasks
4. Build flows using Celigo's visual interface

**Webhook intermediary pattern:**
1. Set up Tallyfy webhooks to send events to a middleware endpoint
2. Configure Celigo to poll or receive these events
3. Process events through Celigo flows to update connected systems
4. Use Celigo's API management to create reusable integration endpoints

**Real-time triggers with webhooks:**
- Configure webhook listeners in Celigo for Tallyfy events
- React to task completions, process launches, status changes
- Celigo generates unique URLs to receive webhook payloads
- Combine with scheduled exports for reliable event processing
- Enable bidirectional sync between Tallyfy and other systems

**Core Tallyfy API endpoints:**
- `POST /api/v1/processes` - Launch new processes from blueprints
- `POST /api/v1/tasks` - Create standalone tasks
- `GET /api/v1/tasks` - Retrieve task details and status
- `PUT /api/v1/tasks/{id}` - Update task status or mark complete
- `POST /api/v1/webhooks` - Configure real-time event notifications
- `GET /api/v1/blueprints` - List available process templates
- `POST /api/v1/runs` - Create process instances (alternative endpoint)

**API terminology mapping:**
- "Blueprints" in UI = "Checklists" in API
- "Processes" in UI = "Runs" in API
- "Templates" in UI = "Blueprints" in API

### Technical requirements

To prepare for the Celigo integration:

**Tallyfy configuration:**
- API access enabled in your Tallyfy organization
