## Visual workflow automation with Make

Make (formerly Integromat) is a visual [integration](/products/pro/integrations/) platform that connects Tallyfy with hundreds of business applications. You build scenario-based workflows to automate multi-step [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) across your apps - no coding required. For background on how automation transforms business operations, see the [workflow automation guide](https://tallyfy.com/workflow-automation/).

Tallyfy provides a dedicated Make.com custom app with these built-in actions:

- **Start process** - [Launch](/products/pro/launching/) a new process from any template, with kick-off form data
- **Complete task** - Mark [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) as done and submit [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) data
- **Update task** - Change task name, deadline, or assignees (members, guests, groups)
- **Add comment** - Post comments or report problems on tasks
- **Get process / List tasks** - Pull process details or retrieve your assigned tasks
- **Watch new tasks** - Webhook trigger that fires when tasks get assigned to you

### Why use Make with Tallyfy?

- **Visual debugging** - See exactly how data flows through each scenario step
- **Built-in error handling** - Automatic retries and error routes keep things running
- **Data transformation** - Built-in functions reshape data between steps
- **Flexible scheduling** - Run scenarios on demand, on a schedule, or triggered by events

### Common integration scenarios

- [Launch](/products/pro/launching/) onboarding processes when new records appear in HR systems
- Create [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) when support tickets arrive in helpdesk platforms
- Send completed [form data](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) to CRM or ERP systems
- Notify teams in Slack or Microsoft Teams when critical [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) finish

### Getting started

1. Create a Make account at make.com
2. Add the Tallyfy custom app to your scenario
3. Connect using your Tallyfy API token and Organization ID (found in Settings)
4. Pick an action - like Start Process - and configure it
5. Test your scenario with sample data, then activate it

You can also use Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) with Make's HTTP module for custom calls beyond what the built-in app covers.
