- **Complete [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) programmatically** - Mark tasks as complete when external conditions are met
- **Capture form data** - Send [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) submissions to external systems
- **Visual scenario builder** - Create complex multi-step automations with an intuitive drag-and-drop interface
- **Advanced data transformation** - Use built-in functions to transform and route data between applications
