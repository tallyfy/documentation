## What is n8n and how does it work with Tallyfy?

n8n connects Tallyfy with 400+ business applications through visual workflows. For a broader perspective on automation strategies, see our guide on [how to automate business processes](https://tallyfy.com/automate-business-processes/). It's an AI-native automation platform that's rapidly becoming the developer-friendly alternative to Zapier and Make. You can self-host for complete control or use their cloud service - your choice.

n8n has grown rapidly as a developer-friendly automation platform with a thriving community of users and community-built integrations. What makes this particularly exciting for Tallyfy users is n8n's focus on AI-first automation - many workflows incorporate AI or LLM integrations.

Tallyfy has a dedicated n8n connector that provides seamless integration through 60+ operations across 10 resources. The connector supports everything from launching processes to managing tasks, users, and form fields. You can also use n8n's flexible HTTP Request and Webhook nodes for custom integrations with Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) and [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/).

:::tip[Why choose n8n?]
n8n's fair-code license and self-hosting options eliminate vendor lock-in while keeping costs predictable. The platform's AI-native approach means you can combine traditional automation with LLM capabilities in a single workflow. Plus, when visual building isn't enough, you can write JavaScript or Python code directly in the workflow.

### Key advantages of n8n for Tallyfy integration:

| Feature | Benefit for Tallyfy Users |
|---------|---------------------------|
| **Dedicated Tallyfy connector** | 60+ operations across blueprints, processes, tasks, users, and more - no custom HTTP requests needed |
| **AI-native platform** | Combine Tallyfy automation with AI analysis, content generation, and intelligent routing |
| **Self-hosting option** | Deploy on your infrastructure for maximum security, compliance, and cost control |
| **Visual workflow builder** | Design complex multi-system integrations with drag-and-drop simplicity |
| **Code when needed** | Add JavaScript or Python for advanced logic while keeping most workflow visual |
| **400+ integrations** | Connect Tallyfy to CRM, ERP, communication tools, and specialized business systems |
| **Enterprise-ready** | Advanced permissions, SSO, air-gapped deployments, and enterprise support |
| **Fair pricing model** | Execution-based pricing scales with your business - no surprise costs |
| **Unlimited active workflows** | No artificial limits on active workflows (unlike some competitors) |
| **Active community** | 2,200+ community nodes and growing ecosystem of specialized integrations |

**Understanding n8n's execution-based pricing:**

One workflow execution counts as one operation regardless of how many nodes it contains. A 100-node workflow that processes complex logic costs the same as a simple 5-node workflow. This makes n8n particularly cost-effective for sophisticated Tallyfy integrations with multiple data transformations, API calls, and conditional logic.

### Common Tallyfy + n8n integration scenarios:

1. **Intelligent process launching**
   - Launch Tallyfy processes when specific conditions are met across multiple systems
   - Use AI to analyze incoming requests and automatically start the right workflow
   - Trigger processes based on threshold breaches, time schedules, or external events

2. **AI-enhanced data processing**
   - Analyze form responses with LLMs to extract insights and next actions
   - Automatically categorize and prioritize processes based on content analysis
   - Generate executive summaries of completed workflows using AI

**Choosing an LLM provider for AI workflows:**

n8n supports multiple LLM providers through dedicated nodes. For maximum flexibility, consider using **Open Router** - it lets you switch between different AI models (Claude, GPT-4, Llama, etc.) without rebuilding your workflows. While there's a small premium for this flexibility, the ability to instantly swap models when one underperforms or pricing changes makes it worthwhile for production AI agents.

For AI agents that need persistent memory or knowledge bases, **Supabase vector stores** integrate smoothly with n8n and provide better performance than n8n's native data tables for production workloads.

3. **Cross-system orchestration**
   - Synchronize data between Tallyfy and multiple business systems in real-time
   - Create complex approval chains that span Tallyfy and external approval systems
   - Build notification networks that keep stakeholders informed across platforms

4. **Advanced automation patterns**
   - Use conditional logic to route processes through different paths based on data
   - Implement automatic escalation when processes stall or deadlines approach
   - Create feedback loops that improve process efficiency over time

5. **Document and reporting automation**
   - Generate contracts, reports, and documents based on completed process data
   - Automatically archive completed processes to document management systems
   - Create audit trails and compliance reports across multiple systems

### Getting started with n8n and Tallyfy:

<Steps>

1. **Set up n8n**
   Choose between self-hosted (using Docker, npm, or Kubernetes) or n8n Cloud. For testing, you can start with n8n Cloud's free tier.

2. **Get your Tallyfy API credentials**
   Get your Tallyfy [API key](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) from your account settings. You'll need this for authentication.

3. **Create your first workflow**
   Use n8n's HTTP Request node to connect to Tallyfy endpoints. Start with a simple test like getting your process list.

4. **Add triggers and actions**
   Set up webhooks to get updates from Tallyfy, or create scheduled triggers to check for changes.

5. **Test and deploy**
   Use n8n's execution view to debug your workflow, then activate it for production use.

</Steps>

### Technical implementation approaches:

**Option 1: Dedicated Tallyfy Connector**
The easiest approach uses our community-built n8n node with 60+ pre-configured operations:

- **Authentication**: Simple credential setup with API token and organization ID
- **Operations**: Launch processes, manage tasks, update form fields, handle users and guests
- **Built-in features**: Pagination, error handling, and response formatting
- **Resource coverage**: Blueprints, processes, tasks, form fields, comments, users, guests, groups, search, and ID finder

**Option 2: HTTP Request Node**
For custom integrations or advanced use cases:

- **Authentication**: Bearer token with your Tallyfy API key
- **Base URL**: `https://go.tallyfy.com/api/`
- **Content Type**: `application/json` for most requests
- **Methods**: Full REST support (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

**Real-time updates via Webhooks**
Set up the Webhook node to receive instant notifications from Tallyfy when tasks complete, processes update, or forms are submitted. Configure your webhook URL in Tallyfy settings and n8n handles the rest automatically.

:::note[Handling files in n8n]
When working with file uploads from Tallyfy forms, n8n processes binary data and sends files to cloud storage services like Google Drive, Dropbox, or S3. You can use n8n's built-in nodes to work with images, PDFs, and other file types as part of your workflow. File handling in n8n is surprisingly smooth - none of the "encode this, decode that" nonsense you might expect.

### Deployment and enterprise options:

**Cloud vs. Self-Hosted Decision Matrix:**

| Use Case | Recommended Option | Key Benefits |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|
| Quick testing and small teams | n8n Cloud | Zero setup, automatic updates, built-in scaling |
| Enterprise compliance | Self-hosted | Complete data control, air-gapped deployment, custom security |
| High-volume processing | Kubernetes | Horizontal scaling, fault tolerance, resource optimization |
| Cost optimization | Docker self-hosted | Predictable costs, no per-execution charges |

**Self-Hosting Options:**
- **Docker**: Single-command deployment with persistent data
- **Kubernetes**: Enterprise-grade scaling with high availability
- **npm/Node.js**: Direct installation for maximum control
- **Air-gapped**: Complete isolation for sensitive environments

**Enterprise Features:**
- Advanced user permissions and role-based access control
- Single Sign-On (SSO) integration with major identity providers
- Audit logging and compliance reporting
- Custom branding and white-label deployment
- Priority support with SLA guarantees

For organizations with strict compliance requirements, n8n's self-hosted option ensures your Tallyfy integration data never leaves your infrastructure while maintaining full automation capabilities.

**HIPAA and healthcare compliance:**

If your Tallyfy workflows handle protected health information (PHI), you have two paths with n8n:
- **Enterprise tier**: n8n offers HIPAA-compliant cloud hosting through their enterprise package
- **Self-hosted**: Deploy n8n on your own HIPAA-compliant AWS or Azure infrastructure with your own security controls

n8n Cloud's standard tiers cannot provide a Business Associate Agreement (BAA), so healthcare organizations typically choose self-hosting for complete compliance control.
