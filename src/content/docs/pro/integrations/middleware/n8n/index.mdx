## What is n8n and how does it work with Tallyfy?

n8n is an open-source workflow automation platform that connects Tallyfy with hundreds of business applications through visual workflows. Unlike traditional middleware platforms, n8n gives you both cloud-hosted and self-hosted options, letting you have complete control over your data and integrations while avoiding vendor lock-in (which is refreshing in a world of "you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave" SaaS platforms).

While Tallyfy doesn't have a dedicated n8n node yet, n8n's powerful HTTP Request and Webhook nodes make it simple to integrate with Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) and [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/). This flexibility helps you build sophisticated automations that connect your Tallyfy [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) with any system in your technology stack. Honestly, the HTTP Request node is so flexible you might not even need a dedicated Tallyfy node.

:::tip[Why choose n8n?]
n8n stands out for organizations that want powerful automation capabilities without the high costs of platforms like Zapier. Its fair-code license, self-hosting option, and pricing based on workflow executions (not individual operations) make it particularly cost-effective for high-volume integrations. Plus, you can add custom JavaScript or Python code when you need it (because sometimes you just need to write actual code, not click through 50 configuration screens).

### Key advantages of n8n for Tallyfy integration:

| Feature | Benefit for Tallyfy Users |
|---------|---------------------------|
| **Self-hosting option** | Keep all integration data on your own servers for maximum security and compliance |
| **Visual workflow builder** | Design complex Tallyfy integrations with drag-and-drop simplicity |
| **HTTP Request node** | Connect to any Tallyfy API endpoint with complete control over requests |
| **Webhook node** | Get real-time updates from Tallyfy when [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) or processes change |
| **Code flexibility** | Add custom JavaScript or Python when you need advanced data transformations |
| **500+ integrations** | Connect Tallyfy to popular tools like Slack, Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, and more |
| **Error handling** | Built-in retry logic and error workflows keep automation reliable |
| **Debugging tools** | Step-by-step execution view helps troubleshoot integration issues |

### Common Tallyfy + n8n integration scenarios:

1. **Automated process launching**
   - [Launch](/products/pro/launching/) Tallyfy processes when new records appear in your CRM
   - Start onboarding workflows when employees are added to your HR system
   - Trigger quality control processes based on IoT sensor data

2. **Data synchronization**
   - Push [form field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) responses to spreadsheets or databases
   - Update customer records in your CRM when Tallyfy tasks complete
   - Sync process status with project management tools

3. **Multi-step workflows**
   - Collect data from multiple systems before launching a Tallyfy process
   - Route completed task data through approval chains in other systems
   - Generate documents and reports based on process completion

4. **AI-enhanced automation**
   - Use n8n's AI nodes to analyze Tallyfy form responses
   - Automatically categorize and route processes based on content
   - Generate summaries of completed processes using LLMs

### Getting started with n8n and Tallyfy:

<Steps>

1. **Set up n8n**
   Choose between self-hosted (using Docker, npm, or Kubernetes) or n8n Cloud. For testing, you can start with n8n Cloud's free tier.

2. **Get your Tallyfy API credentials**
   Get your Tallyfy [API key](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) from your account settings. You'll need this for authentication.

3. **Create your first workflow**
   Use n8n's HTTP Request node to connect to Tallyfy endpoints. Start with a simple test like getting your process list.

4. **Add triggers and actions**
   Set up webhooks to get updates from Tallyfy, or create scheduled triggers to check for changes.

5. **Test and deploy**
   Use n8n's execution view to debug your workflow, then activate it for production use.

</Steps>

### Technical implementation basics:

The HTTP Request node serves as your primary tool for Tallyfy integration. Here's what you need to know:

- **Authentication**: Use Bearer token authentication with your Tallyfy API key
- **Base URL**: `https://go.tallyfy.com/api/`
- **Content Type**: Set to `application/json` for most requests
- **Methods**: Support for GET, POST, PUT, DELETE operations

For getting real-time updates from Tallyfy, set up the Webhook node to listen for events like task completion, process updates, or form submissions. Tallyfy will send JSON payloads to your n8n webhook URL whenever these events happen. It's beautifully simple - no polling, no complex setup, just good old HTTP POST requests.

:::note[Handling files in n8n]
When working with file uploads from Tallyfy forms, n8n can process binary data and send files to cloud storage services like Google Drive, Dropbox, or S3. You can also use n8n's built-in nodes to work with images, PDFs, and other file types as part of your workflow. File handling in n8n is surprisingly smooth - none of the "encode this, decode that" nonsense you might expect.
:::

### Deployment options:

- **n8n Cloud**: Managed hosting with automatic updates and scaling
- **Self-hosted**: Deploy on your own infrastructure for complete control
- **Docker**: Quick deployment using the official n8n Docker image
- **Kubernetes**: Scale n8n across multiple nodes for high-volume workflows
- **npm**: Install directly on your server using Node.js

For organizations with strict security requirements, n8n can run completely air-gapped on private networks, ensuring your Tallyfy integration data never leaves your infrastructure (perfect for those "we don't trust the cloud" organizations).
