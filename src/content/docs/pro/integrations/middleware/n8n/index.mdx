## What is n8n and how does it work with Tallyfy?

n8n connects Tallyfy with 400+ business applications through visual workflows. It's an AI-native automation platform that's rapidly becoming the developer-friendly alternative to Zapier and Make. You can self-host for complete control or use their cloud service - your choice.

**Recent breakthrough**: n8n closed a â‚¬55M Series B in March 2025, with revenue growing 5x year-over-year. The platform now serves 230k+ active users and boasts over 2,200 community-built integrations. What makes this particularly exciting for Tallyfy users is n8n's pivot to AI-first automation - 75% of workflows now incorporate AI or LLM integrations.

Tallyfy has a dedicated n8n connector that provides seamless integration through 60+ operations across 10 resources. The connector supports everything from launching processes to managing tasks, users, and form fields. You can also use n8n's flexible HTTP Request and Webhook nodes for custom integrations with Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) and [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/).

:::tip[Why choose n8n in 2025?]
n8n's fair-code license and self-hosting options eliminate vendor lock-in while keeping costs predictable. Unlike Zapier's per-operation pricing, n8n charges based on workflow executions. The platform's AI-native approach means you can combine traditional automation with LLM capabilities in a single workflow. Plus, when visual building isn't enough, you can write JavaScript or Python code directly in the workflow.

### Common Tallyfy + n8n integration scenarios:

1. **Intelligent process launching**
   - Launch Tallyfy processes when specific conditions are met across multiple systems
   - Use AI to analyze incoming requests and automatically start the right workflow
   - Trigger processes based on threshold breaches, time schedules, or external events

2. **AI-enhanced data processing**
   - Analyze form responses with LLMs to extract insights and next actions
   - Automatically categorize and prioritize processes based on content analysis
   - Generate executive summaries of completed workflows using AI

3. **Cross-system orchestration**
   - Synchronize data between Tallyfy and multiple business systems in real-time
   - Create complex approval chains that span Tallyfy and external approval systems
   - Build notification networks that keep stakeholders informed across platforms

4. **Advanced automation patterns**
   - Use conditional logic to route processes through different paths based on data
   - Implement automatic escalation when processes stall or deadlines approach
   - Create feedback loops that improve process efficiency over time

5. **Document and reporting automation**
   - Generate contracts, reports, and documents based on completed process data
   - Automatically archive completed processes to document management systems
   - Create audit trails and compliance reports across multiple systems

### Getting started with n8n and Tallyfy:

<Steps>

1. **Set up n8n**
   Choose between self-hosted (using Docker, npm, or Kubernetes) or n8n Cloud. For testing, you can start with n8n Cloud's free tier.

2. **Get your Tallyfy API credentials**
   Get your Tallyfy [API key](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) from your account settings. You'll need this for authentication.

3. **Create your first workflow**
   Use n8n's HTTP Request node to connect to Tallyfy endpoints. Start with a simple test like getting your process list.

4. **Add triggers and actions**
   Set up webhooks to get updates from Tallyfy, or create scheduled triggers to check for changes.

5. **Test and deploy**
   Use n8n's execution view to debug your workflow, then activate it for production use.

</Steps>

### Technical implementation approaches:

**Option 1: Dedicated Tallyfy Connector**
The easiest approach uses our community-built n8n node with 60+ pre-configured operations:

- **Authentication**: Simple credential setup with API token and organization ID
- **Operations**: Launch processes, manage tasks, update form fields, handle users and guests
- **Built-in features**: Pagination, error handling, and response formatting
- **Resource coverage**: Blueprints, processes, tasks, form fields, comments, users, guests, groups, search, and ID finder

**Option 2: HTTP Request Node**
For custom integrations or advanced use cases:

- **Authentication**: Bearer token with your Tallyfy API key
- **Base URL**: `https://go.tallyfy.com/api/`
- **Content Type**: `application/json` for most requests
- **Methods**: Full REST support (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

**Real-time updates via Webhooks**
Set up the Webhook node to receive instant notifications from Tallyfy when tasks complete, processes update, or forms are submitted. Configure your webhook URL in Tallyfy settings and n8n handles the rest automatically.

:::note[Handling files in n8n]
When working with file uploads from Tallyfy forms, n8n processes binary data and sends files to cloud storage services like Google Drive, Dropbox, or S3. You can use n8n's built-in nodes to work with images, PDFs, and other file types as part of your workflow. File handling in n8n is surprisingly smooth - none of the "encode this, decode that" nonsense you might expect.

### Deployment and enterprise options:

**Cloud vs. Self-Hosted Decision Matrix:**

| Use Case | Recommended Option | Key Benefits |
|----------|-------------------|-------------|
| Quick testing and small teams | n8n Cloud | Zero setup, automatic updates, built-in scaling |
| Enterprise compliance | Self-hosted | Complete data control, air-gapped deployment, custom security |
| High-volume processing | Kubernetes | Horizontal scaling, fault tolerance, resource optimization |
| Cost optimization | Docker self-hosted | Predictable costs, no per-execution charges |

**Self-Hosting Options:**
- **Docker**: Single-command deployment with persistent data
- **Kubernetes**: Enterprise-grade scaling with high availability
- **npm/Node.js**: Direct installation for maximum control
- **Air-gapped**: Complete isolation for sensitive environments

**Enterprise Features (2025):**
- Advanced user permissions and role-based access control
- Single Sign-On (SSO) integration with major identity providers
- Audit logging and compliance reporting
- Custom branding and white-label deployment
- Priority support with SLA guarantees

For organizations with strict compliance requirements, n8n's self-hosted option ensures your Tallyfy integration data never leaves your infrastructure while maintaining full automation capabilities.
