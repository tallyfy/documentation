## What is n8n and how does it work with Tallyfy?

n8n connects Tallyfy with hundreds of business applications through visual workflows. It's a developer-friendly alternative to Zapier and Make, with strong AI and LLM support baked in. You can self-host for full control or use their cloud service. For a broader perspective on automation strategies, see our guide on [how to automate business processes](https://tallyfy.com/automate-business-processes/).

Tallyfy has a dedicated n8n connector with 55 operations across 10 resources - blueprints, processes, tasks, form fields, comments, users, guests, groups, search, and ID finder. You can also use n8n's HTTP Request and Webhook nodes for custom integrations with Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) and [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/).

:::tip[Why choose n8n?]
n8n's fair-code license and self-hosting options eliminate vendor lock-in while keeping costs predictable. You can combine traditional automation with LLM capabilities in a single workflow, and write JavaScript or Python code directly when visual building isn't enough.

### Key advantages of n8n for Tallyfy integration

| Feature | Benefit for Tallyfy users |
|---------|---------------------------|
| **Dedicated Tallyfy connector** | 55 operations across blueprints, processes, tasks, users, and more - no custom HTTP requests needed |
| **AI-native platform** | Combine Tallyfy automation with AI analysis, content generation, and intelligent routing |
| **Self-hosting option** | Deploy on your infrastructure for security, compliance, and cost control |
| **Visual workflow builder** | Drag-and-drop multi-system integrations |
| **Code when needed** | Add JavaScript or Python for advanced logic |
| **Hundreds of integrations** | Connect Tallyfy to CRM, ERP, communication tools, and other business systems |
| **Enterprise-ready** | Advanced permissions, SSO, air-gapped deployments |
| **Execution-based pricing** | A 100-node workflow costs the same as a 5-node one - no per-node charges |

### Common Tallyfy + n8n integration scenarios

1. **Intelligent process launching** - Launch Tallyfy processes when conditions are met across multiple systems. Use AI to analyze incoming requests and start the right workflow automatically.

2. **AI-enhanced data processing** - Analyze form responses with LLMs, categorize processes based on content, or generate summaries of completed workflows.

3. **Cross-system orchestration** - Synchronize data between Tallyfy and other business systems in real-time. Build approval chains that span multiple platforms.

4. **Advanced automation patterns** - Route processes through different paths with conditional logic. Set up automatic escalation when deadlines approach.

5. **Document and reporting automation** - Generate contracts and reports from completed process data. Archive processes to document management systems automatically.

### Getting started with n8n and Tallyfy

<Steps>

1. **Set up n8n**
   Choose self-hosted (Docker, npm, or Kubernetes) or n8n Cloud.

2. **Get your Tallyfy credentials**
   Grab your Tallyfy [access token](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) and organization ID from your account settings.

3. **Create your first workflow**
   Use the Tallyfy connector node or n8n's HTTP Request node to connect to Tallyfy endpoints.

4. **Add triggers and actions**
   Set up webhooks to receive updates from Tallyfy, or create scheduled triggers to check for changes.

5. **Test and deploy**
   Use n8n's execution view to debug your workflow, then activate it for production.

</Steps>

### Technical implementation approaches

**Option 1: Dedicated Tallyfy connector**
The easiest approach - install the community-built n8n node (`n8n-nodes-tallyfy`) with 55 pre-configured operations:

- **Authentication**: Access token and organization ID
- **Operations**: Launch processes, manage tasks, update form fields, handle users and guests
- **Resource coverage**: Blueprints, processes, tasks, form fields, comments, users, guests, groups, search, and ID finder

**Option 2: HTTP Request node**
For custom integrations or advanced use cases:

- **Authentication**: Bearer token with your Tallyfy access token
- **Base URL**: `https://go.tallyfy.com/api/`
- **Content Type**: `application/json`
- **Methods**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

**Real-time updates via webhooks**
Set up the Webhook node to receive notifications from Tallyfy when tasks complete, processes update, or forms are submitted. Configure your webhook URL in Tallyfy's settings and n8n handles the rest.

:::note[Handling files in n8n]
When working with file uploads from Tallyfy forms, n8n can process binary data and send files to cloud storage like Google Drive, Dropbox, or S3. Built-in nodes handle images, PDFs, and other file types as part of your workflow.

### Deployment and enterprise options

**Cloud vs. self-hosted:**

| Use case | Recommended option | Why |
|----------|-------------------|-----|
| Quick testing, small teams | n8n Cloud | Zero setup, automatic updates |
| Enterprise compliance | Self-hosted | Full data control, air-gapped deployment |
| High-volume processing | Kubernetes | Horizontal scaling, fault tolerance |
| Cost optimization | Docker self-hosted | Predictable costs, no per-execution charges |

**Self-hosting options:** Docker (single-command deployment), Kubernetes (high availability), npm/Node.js (direct install), or air-gapped for sensitive environments.

**Enterprise features:** Role-based access control, SSO with major identity providers, audit logging, and priority support with SLA guarantees.

For organizations with strict compliance needs, self-hosting keeps your Tallyfy integration data entirely on your own infrastructure.
