## Practical n8n workflows for Tallyfy automation

Need ready-to-use n8n workflows that actually work? You're in the right place. These examples show common integration patterns with Tallyfy - complete with workflow structures and configuration details you can copy directly.

### Example 1: CRM to Tallyfy process automation

Automatically [launch](/products/pro/launching/) a customer onboarding [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) when a deal is marked as "Won" in your CRM.

**Workflow components:**

1. **Webhook node** (or CRM-specific trigger)
   - Receives notification when deal status changes
   - Filters for "Won" status only

2. **HTTP Request node** - Get customer details
   - Method: GET
   - URL: Your CRM API endpoint for customer data

3. **HTTP Request node** - Launch Tallyfy process
   - Method: POST
   - URL: `https://go.tallyfy.com/api/runs`
   - Body:
   ```json
   {
     "blueprint_id": "customer_onboarding_template_id",
     "name": "Onboarding - {{$json.customer_name}}",
     "kickoff": {
       "customer_name": "{{$json.customer_name}}",
       "email": "{{$json.email}}",
       "package": "{{$json.deal_type}}",
       "account_manager": "{{$json.assigned_to}}"
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Slack node** (optional)
   - Send notification to sales team about process launch

### Example 2: Form submission to multi-system update

Here's how to update multiple systems whenever someone submits a Tallyfy [form](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/). No manual copying required.

**Workflow components:**

1. **Webhook node**
   - Configure in Tallyfy to trigger on task completion
   - Filter for specific form-containing tasks

2. **IF node** - Check task type
   - Condition: `{{$json.task.blueprint_step_id}} == "form_step_id"`

3. **Set node** - Extract form data
   - Map Tallyfy form fields to standardized variables

4. **HTTP Request node** - Update CRM
   - Method: PUT
   - URL: CRM contact endpoint
   - Map form fields to CRM fields

5. **Google Sheets node** - Log submission
   - Append row with form data and timestamp

6. **Email node** - Send confirmation
   - To: Form submitter
   - Include summary of submitted data

### Visualizing n8n workflow patterns

This diagram shows how n8n workflows handle multi-system updates with conditional branching and retry logic.

```d2
CRM: "CRM"
Email: "Email"
Extract: "Extract"
Sheets: "Sheets"
Success: "Success"
Start: "Webhook: Task Completed"
Check: "Task has form?"
Start -> Check
Check -> Extract: "Yes"
Extract: "Extract Form Data"
Check -> Skip: "No"
Skip: "Skip Processing"
Extract -> CRM: "Update CRM" {
  style.animated: true
}
Extract -> Sheets: "Update Google Sheets" {
  style.animated: true
}
Extract -> Email: "Send Email" {
  style.animated: true
}
CRM -> Success: "Success Log"
Sheets -> Success
Email -> Success
```

**What to notice:**
- **Parallel processing branches** - The workflow updates CRM, Google Sheets, and sends emails simultaneously, reducing total execution time
- **Exponential backoff retry pattern** - Failed operations retry with increasing wait times (2s, 4s, 8s) to avoid overwhelming systems
- **Conditional path handling** - The IF node prevents processing tasks without forms, saving resources and preventing errors

### Example 3: Scheduled process launcher with data collection

Want to launch weekly review processes that automatically gather data from your tools? This workflow does exactly that.

**Workflow components:**

1. **Schedule Trigger node**
   - Cron expression: `0 9 * * 1` (Every Monday at 9 AM)

2. **HTTP Request node** - Get sales data
   - Connect to your analytics API
   - Fetch last week's metrics

3. **HTTP Request node** - Get support tickets
   - Query helpdesk API for open tickets

4. **Code node** - Process data
   ```javascript
   const salesTotal = items[0].json.total;
   const openTickets = items[1].json.count;
   const reviewData = {
     week_ending: new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0],
     sales_total: salesTotal,
     support_tickets: openTickets,
     review_priority: openTickets > 50 ? "High" : "Normal"
   };
   return [{json: reviewData}];
   ```

5. **HTTP Request node** - Launch Tallyfy process
   - Method: POST
   - URL: `https://go.tallyfy.com/api/runs`
   - Include collected data in kickoff fields

### Example 4: Document generation from completed processes

Need PDF reports when your Tallyfy processes finish? Here's a workflow that creates them automatically.

**Workflow components:**

1. **Webhook node**
   - Tallyfy webhook for process completion

2. **HTTP Request node** - Get process details
   - Method: GET
   - URL: `https://go.tallyfy.com/api/runs/{{$json.run_id}}`

3. **HTTP Request node** - Get all task data
   - Method: GET
   - URL: `https://go.tallyfy.com/api/tasks?run_id={{$json.run_id}}`

4. **Code node** - Format report data
   ```javascript
   const tasks = $input.all();
   const reportData = {
     process_name: tasks[0].json.run.name,
     completed_date: new Date().toISOString(),
     task_summary: tasks[1].json.map(task => ({
       name: task.name,
       completed_by: task.completed_by_name,
       form_data: task.form_fields
     }))
   };
   return [{json: reportData}];
   ```

5. **HTML node** - Generate HTML template
   - Create formatted report layout

6. **Convert to PDF node** (or external service)
   - Convert HTML to PDF

7. **Upload to cloud storage**
   - Store in Google Drive, Dropbox, or S3

### Example 5: Intelligent task routing with AI

Let AI analyze your Tallyfy form responses and route tasks to the right people. Your team gets the work they're best at - automatically.

**Workflow components:**

1. **Webhook node**
   - Trigger on Tallyfy form submission

2. **OpenAI node** (or similar AI service)
   - Analyze form content for urgency and category
   - Prompt: "Categorize this request and assign priority"

3. **Switch node** - Route based on AI analysis
   - Branch for each category/priority combination

4. **HTTP Request node** (multiple) - Update task assignment
   - Method: PUT
   - URL: `https://go.tallyfy.com/api/tasks/{{$json.task_id}}`
   - Assign to appropriate Tallyfy [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) based on routing

5. **Notification nodes**
   - Alert assigned team member via preferred channel

### Best practices for n8n + Tallyfy workflows

1. **Error handling**: Your workflows will fail eventually - plan for it:
   ```
   On Error: Continue (Error Output)
   → Log error details
   → Send alert notification
   → Store failed data for retry
   ```

2. **Rate limiting**: Don't hammer the APIs. Add **Wait** nodes between bulk operations:
   - Wait 1 second between API calls when processing many items

3. **Data validation**: Check your data before sending it. Use **IF** nodes to validate:
   - Required fields actually exist
   - Data formats match what Tallyfy expects

4. **Workflow organization**: Future you will thank present you. Use **Sticky Note** nodes to document:
   - Workflow purpose and triggers
   - Required credentials and configuration
   - Expected data formats

5. **Testing approach**:
   - Start with **Manual Trigger** for testing
   - Add **Set** nodes with test data
   - Use **Stop and Error** nodes for debugging

### Debugging tips

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Workflow not triggering** | Check webhook is active in both n8n and Tallyfy |
| **Data not mapping correctly** | Use expression editor's "Current Node" tab to see available data |
| **API errors** | Add HTTP Request "Full Response" option to see detailed errors |
| **Performance issues** | Split large workflows into sub-workflows |

### Advanced patterns

**Parallel processing**: Process multiple items at once (without breaking things). Use **Split In Batches** node to handle batches while respecting rate limits.

**Retry logic**: Sometimes things fail. Here's smart retry with **Wait** and **IF** nodes:
1. Set retry counter
2. On error, increment counter
3. Wait exponentially longer between retries (2s, 4s, 8s...)
4. Stop after max retries reached

**Data enrichment**: Need more context? Chain multiple API calls to gather complete data before launching Tallyfy processes. Perfect for pulling customer history, support tickets, or sales data into one complete picture.
