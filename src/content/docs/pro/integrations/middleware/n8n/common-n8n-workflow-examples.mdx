## Practical n8n workflows for Tallyfy automation

This guide provides practical, ready-to-use n8n workflow examples that demonstrate common integration patterns with Tallyfy. Each example includes the workflow structure and key configuration details.

### Example 1: CRM to Tallyfy process automation

Automatically [launch](/products/pro/launching/) a customer onboarding [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) when a deal is marked as "Won" in your CRM.

**Workflow components:**

1. **Webhook node** (or CRM-specific trigger)
   - Receives notification when deal status changes
   - Filters for "Won" status only

2. **HTTP Request node** - Get customer details
   - Method: GET
   - URL: Your CRM API endpoint for customer data

3. **HTTP Request node** - Launch Tallyfy process
   - Method: POST
   - URL: `https://go.tallyfy.com/api/runs`
   - Body:
   ```json
   {
     "blueprint_id": "customer_onboarding_template_id",
     "name": "Onboarding - {{$json.customer_name}}",
     "kickoff": {
       "customer_name": "{{$json.customer_name}}",
       "email": "{{$json.email}}",
       "package": "{{$json.deal_type}}",
       "account_manager": "{{$json.assigned_to}}"
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Slack node** (optional)
   - Send notification to sales team about process launch

### Example 2: Form submission to multi-system update

When a Tallyfy [form](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) is submitted, update multiple systems with the data.

**Workflow components:**

1. **Webhook node**
   - Configure in Tallyfy to trigger on task completion
   - Filter for specific form-containing tasks

2. **IF node** - Check task type
   - Condition: `{{$json.task.blueprint_step_id}} == "form_step_id"`

3. **Set node** - Extract form data
   - Map Tallyfy form fields to standardized variables

4. **HTTP Request node** - Update CRM
   - Method: PUT
   - URL: CRM contact endpoint
   - Map form fields to CRM fields

5. **Google Sheets node** - Log submission
   - Append row with form data and timestamp

6. **Email node** - Send confirmation
   - To: Form submitter
   - Include summary of submitted data

### Example 3: Scheduled process launcher with data collection

Launch weekly review processes with data gathered from multiple sources.

**Workflow components:**

1. **Schedule Trigger node**
   - Cron expression: `0 9 * * 1` (Every Monday at 9 AM)

2. **HTTP Request node** - Get sales data
   - Connect to your analytics API
   - Fetch last week's metrics

3. **HTTP Request node** - Get support tickets
   - Query helpdesk API for open tickets

4. **Code node** - Process data
   ```javascript
   const salesTotal = items[0].json.total;
   const openTickets = items[1].json.count;
   const reviewData = {
     week_ending: new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0],
     sales_total: salesTotal,
     support_tickets: openTickets,
     review_priority: openTickets > 50 ? "High" : "Normal"
   };
   return [{json: reviewData}];
   ```

5. **HTTP Request node** - Launch Tallyfy process
   - Method: POST
   - URL: `https://go.tallyfy.com/api/runs`
   - Include collected data in kickoff fields

### Example 4: Document generation from completed processes

Generate PDF reports when specific Tallyfy processes complete.

**Workflow components:**

1. **Webhook node**
   - Tallyfy webhook for process completion

2. **HTTP Request node** - Get process details
   - Method: GET
   - URL: `https://go.tallyfy.com/api/runs/{{$json.run_id}}`

3. **HTTP Request node** - Get all task data
   - Method: GET
   - URL: `https://go.tallyfy.com/api/tasks?run_id={{$json.run_id}}`

4. **Code node** - Format report data
   ```javascript
   const tasks = $input.all();
   const reportData = {
     process_name: tasks[0].json.run.name,
     completed_date: new Date().toISOString(),
     task_summary: tasks[1].json.map(task => ({
       name: task.name,
       completed_by: task.completed_by_name,
       form_data: task.form_fields
     }))
   };
   return [{json: reportData}];
   ```

5. **HTML node** - Generate HTML template
   - Create formatted report layout

6. **Convert to PDF node** (or external service)
   - Convert HTML to PDF

7. **Upload to cloud storage**
   - Store in Google Drive, Dropbox, or S3

### Example 5: Intelligent task routing with AI

Use AI to analyze Tallyfy form responses and automatically route tasks to appropriate team members.

**Workflow components:**

1. **Webhook node**
   - Trigger on Tallyfy form submission

2. **OpenAI node** (or similar AI service)
   - Analyze form content for urgency and category
   - Prompt: "Categorize this request and assign priority"

3. **Switch node** - Route based on AI analysis
   - Branch for each category/priority combination

4. **HTTP Request node** (multiple) - Update task assignment
   - Method: PUT
   - URL: `https://go.tallyfy.com/api/tasks/{{$json.task_id}}`
   - Assign to appropriate Tallyfy [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) based on routing

5. **Notification nodes**
   - Alert assigned team member via preferred channel

### Best practices for n8n + Tallyfy workflows

1. **Error handling**: Always add error branches to handle API failures:
   ```
   On Error: Continue (Error Output)
   → Log error details
   → Send alert notification
   → Store failed data for retry
   ```

2. **Rate limiting**: Add **Wait** nodes between bulk operations:
   - Wait 1 second between API calls when processing many items

3. **Data validation**: Use **IF** nodes to validate data before API calls:
   - Check required fields exist
   - Verify data formats match expectations

4. **Workflow organization**: Use **Sticky Note** nodes to document:
   - Workflow purpose and triggers
   - Required credentials and configuration
   - Expected data formats

5. **Testing approach**:
   - Use **Manual Trigger** for initial testing
   - Add **Set** nodes with test data
   - Use **Stop and Error** nodes for debugging

### Debugging tips

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Workflow not triggering** | Check webhook is active in both n8n and Tallyfy |
| **Data not mapping correctly** | Use expression editor's "Current Node" tab to see available data |
| **API errors** | Add HTTP Request "Full Response" option to see detailed errors |
| **Performance issues** | Split large workflows into sub-workflows |

### Advanced patterns

**Parallel processing**: Use **Split In Batches** node to process multiple items simultaneously while respecting rate limits.

**Retry logic**: Implement custom retry with **Wait** and **IF** nodes:
1. Set retry counter
2. On error, increment counter
3. Wait exponentially longer between retries
4. Stop after max retries reached

**Data enrichment**: Chain multiple API calls to gather comprehensive data before launching Tallyfy processes.

These examples provide solid starting points for your own n8n + Tallyfy integrations. Modify them based on your specific business needs and systems.
