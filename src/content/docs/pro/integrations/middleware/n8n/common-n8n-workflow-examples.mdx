## Practical n8n workflows for Tallyfy automation

These examples show common n8n integration patterns with Tallyfy - complete with workflow structures and configuration details you can adapt directly.

> All Tallyfy API URLs require your organization ID. Replace `{org_id}` with your actual organization ID in every endpoint below.

### Example 1: CRM to Tallyfy process automation

Automatically [launch](/products/pro/launching/) a customer onboarding [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) when a deal is marked as "Won" in your CRM.

**Workflow components:**

1. **Webhook node** (or CRM-specific trigger)
   - Receives deal status change notifications
   - Filters for "Won" status only

2. **HTTP Request node** - Get customer details
   - Method: GET
   - URL: Your CRM API endpoint for customer data

3. **HTTP Request node** - Launch Tallyfy process
   - Method: POST
   - URL: `https://go.tallyfy.com/api/organizations/{org_id}/runs`
   - Body:
   ```json
   {
     "checklist_id": "customer_onboarding_template_id",
     "name": "Onboarding - {{$json.customer_name}}",
     "kickoff": {
       "customer_name": "{{$json.customer_name}}",
       "email": "{{$json.email}}",
       "package": "{{$json.deal_type}}",
       "account_manager": "{{$json.assigned_to}}"
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Slack node** (optional)
   - Notify sales team about the process launch

### Example 2: Form submission to multi-system update

Update multiple systems whenever someone submits a Tallyfy [form](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) - no manual copying required.

**Workflow components:**

1. **Webhook node**
   - Configure in Tallyfy to trigger on task completion
   - Filter for specific form-containing tasks

2. **IF node** - Check task type
   - Condition: `{{$json.task.blueprint_step_id}} == "form_step_id"`

3. **Set node** - Extract form data
   - Map Tallyfy form fields to standardized variables

4. **HTTP Request node** - Update CRM
   - Method: PUT
   - URL: CRM contact endpoint

5. **Google Sheets node** - Log submission
   - Append row with form data and timestamp

6. **Email node** - Send confirmation
   - To: Form submitter with summary of submitted data

### Visualizing n8n workflow patterns

This diagram shows how n8n workflows handle multi-system updates with conditional branching and retry logic.

```d2
CRM: "CRM"
Email: "Email"
Extract: "Extract"
Sheets: "Sheets"
Success: "Success"
Start: "Webhook: Task Completed"
Check: "Task has form?"
Start -> Check
Check -> Extract: "Yes"
Extract: "Extract Form Data"
Check -> Skip: "No"
Skip: "Skip Processing"
Extract -> CRM: "Update CRM" {
  style.animated: true
}
Extract -> Sheets: "Update Google Sheets" {
  style.animated: true
}
Extract -> Email: "Send Email" {
  style.animated: true
}
CRM -> Success: "Success Log"
Sheets -> Success
Email -> Success
```

**What to notice:**
- **Parallel branches** - CRM, Google Sheets, and email updates run simultaneously
- **Conditional path** - The IF node skips tasks without forms, preventing unnecessary processing

### Example 3: Scheduled process launcher with data collection

Launch weekly review processes that automatically gather data from your tools.

**Workflow components:**

1. **Schedule Trigger node**
   - Cron expression: `0 9 * * 1` (every Monday at 9 AM)

2. **HTTP Request node** - Get sales data
   - Connect to your analytics API for last week's metrics

3. **HTTP Request node** - Get support tickets
   - Query helpdesk API for open tickets

4. **Code node** - Process data
   ```javascript
   const salesTotal = items[0].json.total;
   const openTickets = items[1].json.count;
   const reviewData = {
     week_ending: new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0],
     sales_total: salesTotal,
     support_tickets: openTickets,
     review_priority: openTickets > 50 ? "High" : "Normal"
   };
   return [{json: reviewData}];
   ```

5. **HTTP Request node** - Launch Tallyfy process
   - Method: POST
   - URL: `https://go.tallyfy.com/api/organizations/{org_id}/runs`
   - Include collected data in kickoff fields

### Example 4: Document generation from completed processes

Generate PDF reports automatically when Tallyfy processes finish.

**Workflow components:**

1. **Webhook node**
   - Tallyfy webhook for process completion

2. **HTTP Request node** - Get process details
   - Method: GET
   - URL: `https://go.tallyfy.com/api/organizations/{org_id}/runs/{{$json.run_id}}`

3. **HTTP Request node** - Get all task data
   - Method: GET
   - URL: `https://go.tallyfy.com/api/organizations/{org_id}/runs/{{$json.run_id}}/tasks`

4. **Code node** - Format report data
   ```javascript
   const tasks = $input.all();
   const reportData = {
     process_name: tasks[0].json.run.name,
     completed_date: new Date().toISOString(),
     task_summary: tasks[1].json.map(task => ({
       name: task.name,
       completed_by: task.completed_by_name,
       form_data: task.form_fields
     }))
   };
   return [{json: reportData}];
   ```

5. **HTML node** - Generate formatted report layout

6. **Convert to PDF node** (or external service)

7. **Upload to cloud storage** - Google Drive, Dropbox, or S3

### Example 5: Intelligent task routing with AI

Use AI to analyze Tallyfy form responses and route tasks to the right people automatically.

**Workflow components:**

1. **Webhook node**
   - Trigger on Tallyfy form submission

2. **OpenAI node** (or similar AI service)
   - Analyze form content for urgency and category
   - Prompt: "Categorize this request and assign priority"

3. **Switch node** - Route based on AI analysis
   - Branch for each category/priority combination

4. **HTTP Request node** (multiple) - Update task assignment
   - Method: PUT
   - URL: `https://go.tallyfy.com/api/organizations/{org_id}/tasks/{{$json.task_id}}`
   - Assign to appropriate Tallyfy [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) based on routing

5. **Notification nodes**
   - Alert assigned team member via their preferred channel

### Example 6: Human-in-the-loop workflows

n8n's "Send and wait for response" nodes pause workflows for human input - turning hours of manual review into quick approval checks.

**Pattern:**

1. **AI generates content** (proposal, report, blog post)
2. **Workflow pauses** with Slack/Email notification for review
3. **Human reviews** and responds (approve/reject/modify)
4. **Workflow continues** based on the response

**Workflow components:**

1. **Trigger node** - Webhook, schedule, or manual start

2. **AI Agent node** - Generate content that needs review
   - Configure with your preferred LLM (Claude, GPT-4, etc.)
   - Use clear system prompts for consistent output

3. **Slack node** (Human in the Loop category)
   - Action: **Send message and wait for reply**
   - Include "Approve" / "Reject" / "Revise" instructions
   - Workflow pauses until a response arrives

4. **Switch node** - Route based on response
   - "Approved" - continue to next action
   - "Rejected" - log, notify, and end
   - "Revise" - loop back to AI with feedback

5. **Action nodes** - Execute based on approval
   - Send proposal, publish content, or update CRM

**Use cases:**
- **Review proposals before delivery** - AI drafts, human verifies pricing and scope
- **Approve AI content before publishing** - catch hallucinations or tone issues
- **Validate data enrichment** - confirm AI matched the right company

You can chain multiple "Send and wait" nodes with different reviewers for multi-level approvals.

### Switch nodes for intelligent routing

Use AI classification with a Switch node instead of complex IF/ELSE chains.

**Pattern:**
```
Webhook → AI Agent (classify request) → Switch Node → Multiple specialized paths
```

**Configuration:**

1. **AI Agent node** - Classify the input
   - System prompt: "Classify this request as exactly one of: URGENT, NORMAL, or LOW_PRIORITY"
   - Output a single keyword

2. **Switch node** - Route by classification
   - Mode: **Rules**
   - Rule: Value equals "URGENT" - Output 0 (urgent path)
   - Rule: Value equals "NORMAL" - Output 1 (normal path)
   - Fallback: Output 2 (low priority path)

3. **Specialized handling per path**
   - URGENT: Immediate Slack alert + assign to senior staff
   - NORMAL: Standard queue + email notification
   - LOW_PRIORITY: Batch processing + weekly digest

Works well for support ticket triage, lead scoring, content categorization, and compliance checks.

### Best practices for n8n + Tallyfy workflows

1. **Error handling** - workflows will fail eventually, so plan for it:
   ```
   On Error: Continue (Error Output)
   → Log error details
   → Send alert notification
   → Store failed data for retry
   ```

2. **Rate limiting** - add **Wait** nodes between bulk operations. A 1-second delay between API calls prevents throttling.

3. **Data validation** - use **IF** nodes to confirm required fields exist and formats match what Tallyfy expects before sending data.

4. **Workflow organization** - use **Sticky Note** nodes to document the workflow's purpose, required credentials, and expected data formats.

5. **Testing** - start with **Manual Trigger** and **Set** nodes for test data. Use **Stop and Error** nodes for debugging.

6. **Retry settings** - set retry count to 2+ on AI and HTTP nodes with 5000ms between attempts. This handles temporary rate limits automatically.

7. **Version history** - n8n keeps recent workflow versions, but use **Export as JSON** for permanent backups before major changes.

### Debugging tips

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Workflow not triggering** | Check webhook is active in both n8n and Tallyfy |
| **Data not mapping correctly** | Use expression editor's "Current Node" tab to see available data |
| **API errors** | Add HTTP Request "Full Response" option to see detailed errors |
| **Performance issues** | Split large workflows into sub-workflows |

### Advanced patterns

**Parallel processing** - use the **Split In Batches** node to handle multiple items while respecting rate limits.

**Retry logic** with **Wait** and **IF** nodes:
1. Set a retry counter
2. On error, increment the counter
3. Wait exponentially longer between retries (2s, 4s, 8s)
4. Stop after max retries

**Data enrichment** - chain multiple API calls to gather complete data before launching Tallyfy processes. Pull customer history, support tickets, or sales data into one picture before kicking off a workflow.
