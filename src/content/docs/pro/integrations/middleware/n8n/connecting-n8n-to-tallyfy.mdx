## Setting up your n8n and Tallyfy connection

This guide walks you through connecting n8n to Tallyfy using the HTTP Request node. Since Tallyfy doesn't have a dedicated n8n node yet, you'll use n8n's flexible HTTP Request node to interact with Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/).

### Prerequisites

Before starting, you'll need:

- An active Tallyfy account with API access
- n8n installed (either self-hosted or n8n Cloud account)
- Your Tallyfy API key
- Basic understanding of REST APIs (helpful but not required)

### Step 1: Get your Tallyfy API credentials

<Steps>

1. Log into your Tallyfy account and navigate to **Settings** > **API**.

2. Click **Generate API Key** if you haven't created one already.

3. Copy your API key and store it securely. You'll need this for authentication.

4. Note your Organization ID from the API settings page - you'll need this for certain API calls.

</Steps>

:::warning[API Key Security]
Treat your API key like a password. Never share it publicly or commit it to version control. In n8n, use the Credentials feature to store it securely.
:::

### Step 2: Create HTTP Request credentials in n8n

<Steps>

1. In n8n, go to **Credentials** and click **Add Credential**.

2. Search for and select **HTTP Request**.

3. Configure the credential:
   - **Name**: Tallyfy API
   - **Authentication**: Header Auth
   - **Name**: Authorization
   - **Value**: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_HERE (replace with your actual API key)

4. Click **Create** to save the credential.

</Steps>

### Step 3: Configure your first HTTP Request node

Now let's create a simple workflow to test the connection:

<Steps>

1. Create a new workflow in n8n.

2. Add an **HTTP Request** node.

3. Configure the node:
   - **Method**: GET
   - **URL**: `https://api.tallyfy.com/v1/blueprints`
   - **Authentication**: Predefined Credential Type
   - **Credential Type**: HTTP Request
   - **HTTP Request**: Select the "Tallyfy API" credential you created

4. Add these headers:
   - **Accept**: `application/json`
   - **Content-Type**: `application/json`

5. Click **Execute Node** to test the connection.

</Steps>

If successful, you'll see a list of your Tallyfy [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) (called blueprints in the API).

### Step 4: Common API endpoints for Tallyfy

Here are the most useful Tallyfy API endpoints for n8n workflows:

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/blueprints` | GET | List all templates |
| `/blueprints/{id}` | GET | Get specific template details |
| `/runs` | POST | Launch a new process |
| `/runs` | GET | List all processes |
| `/tasks` | GET | List tasks |
| `/tasks/{id}` | PUT | Update a task |
| `/tasks/{id}/complete` | POST | Complete a task |
| `/users` | GET | List organization members |

### Step 5: Launch a process from n8n

Here's how to [launch](/products/pro/launching/) a Tallyfy process using n8n:

<Steps>

1. Add a new **HTTP Request** node to your workflow.

2. Configure it:
   - **Method**: POST
   - **URL**: `https://api.tallyfy.com/v1/runs`
   - **Authentication**: Use your Tallyfy API credential

3. In the **Body Parameters**, add:
   ```json
   {
     "blueprint_id": "YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID",
     "name": "Process launched from n8n",
     "kickoff": {
       "field_1": "value1",
       "field_2": "value2"
     }
   }
   ```

4. Replace `YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID` with an actual template ID from your account.

5. The `kickoff` object should contain any required [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) for process launch.

</Steps>

### Step 6: Handle Tallyfy webhooks in n8n

To receive real-time updates from Tallyfy:

<Steps>

1. Add a **Webhook** node to start your workflow.

2. Copy the webhook URL from the node (click on **Webhook URLs**).

3. In Tallyfy, go to **Settings** > **Webhooks**.

4. Create a new webhook:
   - **URL**: Paste your n8n webhook URL
   - **Events**: Select which events should trigger the webhook

5. Save the webhook in Tallyfy.

6. In n8n, set the webhook to **Production** mode to start receiving events.

</Steps>

### Troubleshooting common issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **401 Unauthorized** | Check your API key is correct and includes "Bearer " prefix |
| **404 Not Found** | Verify the endpoint URL and resource IDs are correct |
| **400 Bad Request** | Check your request body JSON is valid and includes required fields |
| **Rate limiting** | Add delay nodes between API calls if processing many items |

### Best practices for n8n + Tallyfy integration

1. **Use environment variables**: Store your API base URL and other configuration as n8n environment variables.

2. **Error handling**: Add error workflow branches to handle API failures gracefully.

3. **Pagination**: When fetching lists, use pagination parameters to handle large datasets.

4. **Testing**: Use n8n's manual execution to test each node before activating the workflow.

5. **Logging**: Add logging nodes to track important events and debug issues.

### Next steps

Now that you've connected n8n to Tallyfy, you can:

- Build workflows that launch processes based on external triggers
- Sync data between Tallyfy and other systems
- Create automated reports from process data
- Set up notifications for specific process events
