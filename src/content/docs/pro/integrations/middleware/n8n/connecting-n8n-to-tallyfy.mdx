## Connect n8n to Tallyfy

Connecting n8n to Tallyfy takes about 5 minutes now that we have a dedicated connector. You have two options: use our community-built Tallyfy node for instant setup, or use HTTP Request nodes for maximum flexibility. Both approaches work with Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) and handle authentication seamlessly.

The dedicated connector covers most common use cases, while HTTP Request nodes give you complete control for advanced integrations.

### Integration architecture overview

This diagram shows the two connection methods and the bidirectional flow between n8n and Tallyfy.

```

**What to notice:**
- The Tallyfy node provides instant setup for most use cases, while HTTP Request nodes offer complete flexibility for custom integrations
- Both methods converge at the authentication test - if this fails, check your API token and permissions before proceeding
- After successful connection, you gain access to many operations across multiple resources, with webhook support for real-time event handling

### Prerequisites

Before starting, you'll need:

- An active Tallyfy account with API access
- n8n installed (self-hosted, cloud, or local development)
- Your Tallyfy API key and Organization ID
- For custom integrations: basic understanding of REST APIs

### Step 1: Get your Tallyfy API credentials

<Steps>

1. Log into your Tallyfy account and navigate to **Settings** > **Personal Settings** > **API Tokens**.

2. Click **Create Personal Access Token** and give it a descriptive name like "n8n Integration".

3. Copy your API token immediately - you won't see it again after closing the dialog.

4. Find your Organization ID in your Tallyfy URL: `https://go.tallyfy.com/o/YOUR_ORG_ID/` or check the API settings.

5. Note the base URL: `https://go.tallyfy.com/api` for all API calls.

</Steps>

:::warning[API Key Security]
Treat your API key like a password. Never share it publicly or commit it to version control. In n8n, use the Credentials feature to store it securely.
:::

### Step 2: Set up Tallyfy credentials in n8n

**Using the Tallyfy Node (Recommended)**

<Steps>

1. Install the Tallyfy community node:
   - For self-hosted: `npm install n8n-nodes-tallyfy`
   - For n8n Cloud: Request community node installation via support
   - Manual installation: Download from [GitHub](https://github.com/tallyfy/n8n/releases)

2. In n8n, go to **Credentials** and create **Tallyfy API** credential:
   - **Access Token**: Your Personal Access Token from Step 1
   - **Organization ID**: Your Organization ID from your Tallyfy URL
   - **Base URL**: `https://go.tallyfy.com/api` (default)

3. Test the connection using the built-in credential test (calls `/me` endpoint).

</Steps>

**Alternative: HTTP Request Method**

<Steps>

1. For custom integrations, create **HTTP Request** credential:
   - **Authentication**: Header Auth
   - **Name**: Authorization
   - **Value**: `Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN`

2. Add recommended headers: `X-Tallyfy-Client: n8n`, `Accept: application/json`

</Steps>

### Step 3: Test your connection

<Steps>

1. Create a new workflow in n8n.

2. Add a **Tallyfy** node from the node palette (under "Regular nodes").

3. Configure the test:
   - **Credential**: Select your Tallyfy API credential
   - **Resource**: User
   - **Operation**: Get Current

4. Click **Test step** to verify the connection.

5. Success shows your user details, confirming authentication works.

</Steps>

**Alternative test with HTTP Request:**
- **Method**: GET, **URL**: `https://go.tallyfy.com/api/me`
- Use your configured credential

### Step 4: Available operations in the Tallyfy node

**Available resources and operations:**

| Resource | Operations Available | Key Use Cases |
|----------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Blueprint** | Get, Get Many, Create, Update, Delete | Template management and process design |
| **Process** | Launch, Get, Get Many, Update, Archive, Get Tasks | Process lifecycle and monitoring |
| **Task** | Create One-Off, Complete, Get, Get Many, Update Properties, Delete, Clone | Task management and workflow control |
| **Form Field** | Get Fields, Update Value (with guest access) | Dynamic data collection |
| **Comment** | Create, Create Bot, Report Problem, Resolve Issue, Update, Delete | Communication and issue tracking |
| **User** | Get Current, Get, Get Many, Invite, Update Role, Enable, Disable, Convert to Guest | Team management |
| **Guest** | Create, Get, Get Many, Update, Delete, Convert to Member | External participant management |
| **Group** | Create, Get, Get Many, Update, Delete | Team organization |
| **Search** | Global, Tasks, Processes, Blueprints | Resource discovery |
| **ID Finder** | Find Process/Task/Blueprint/Form Field/User/Group IDs | Resource identification utilities |

**Key features:**
- Built-in pagination handling ("Return All" option)
- Automatic error handling and retry logic
- Field validation and type checking
- Support for dynamic field values using expressions

### Step 5: Launch a process using the Tallyfy node

<Steps>

1. Add a **Tallyfy** node and configure:
   - **Resource**: Process
   - **Operation**: Launch
   - **Blueprint ID**: Enter your template ID (e.g., `blueprint_abc123`)

2. Set the **Process Name**: "Process launched from n8n - `{{$json.customer_name}}`"

3. Configure **Launch Data** (kickoff fields):
   ```json
   {
     "customer_name": "{{$json.customer_name}}",
     "project_value": "{{$json.amount}}",
     "priority": "High"
   }
   ```

4. **Optional settings**:
   - **Assignees**: Specify users, guests, or groups for task assignment
   - **Due Date**: Set process deadline
   - **Visibility**: Control who can see the process

5. The node returns the launched process details including process ID and status.

</Steps>

**Launch data tips:**
- Field names must match your blueprint's kickoff form fields exactly
- Use n8n expressions to map data from previous nodes
- Support for text, numbers, dates, users, and file attachments
- Leave optional fields empty - the node handles undefined values gracefully

### Step 6: Handle real-time updates with webhooks

<Steps>

1. Add a **Webhook** node as your workflow trigger:
   - **HTTP Method**: POST
   - **Path**: `/tallyfy-events` (or custom path)
   - **Response Mode**: Last Node

2. Copy the generated webhook URL from n8n.

3. In Tallyfy, go to **Settings** > **Organization Settings** > **Webhooks**.

4. Create a webhook:
   - **URL**: Your n8n webhook URL
   - **Events**: Choose from 15+ event types:
     - `task.completed`
     - `process.launched`
     - `task.assigned`
     - `form.submitted`
     - `process.completed`
   - **Headers**: Optional custom headers
   - **Secret**: For webhook signature verification

5. Test using Tallyfy's built-in webhook tester.

6. Activate your n8n workflow to start receiving events.

</Steps>

:::danger[Test vs Production URL - common mistake]
When building workflows with webhooks, n8n provides two different URLs: a **Test URL** and a **Production URL**. The production URL only becomes active when you switch the workflow to "Active" status.

Many users spend hours debugging because they:
1. Build and test with the Test URL
2. Switch the workflow to Active mode
3. Forget to update the URL in Tallyfy to the Production URL

**Always update your webhook URLs in Tallyfy when going live.** The Test URL stops working once you activate the workflow.
:::

**Real webhook payload structure:**
```json
{
  "event": "task.completed",
  "organization_id": "org_123",
  "data": {
    "task_id": "task_456",
    "run_id": "run_789",
    "blueprint_id": "blueprint_abc",
    "user_id": "user_123",
    "completed_at": "2024-03-15T10:30:00Z",
    "form_data": { /* task form responses */ }
  }
}
```

### Webhook event flow

This sequence diagram illustrates how Tallyfy sends real-time events to n8n with retry logic.

```d2
direction: right

S: Step/Task
T: Tallyfy
Q: Queue
W: Webhook Service
n8n: n8n Workflow

S -> T: 1. User completes task
T -> T: 2. Check webhook config

T -> Q: "3. Queue webhook event" 
T -> T: "Skip webhook" 

Q -> W: 4. Process webhook

W -> n8n: "5. POST to webhook_url" {
  style.animated: true
}
# Timeout: 30 seconds
n8n -> W: "6. Success response (2xx)"
W -> T: "7. Mark delivered"
# Log success
n8n -> W: "Error or timeout" 
W -> W: "Wait (exponential backoff)" 
# 1st: 1min 2nd: 5min 3rd: 15min

W -> T: "8. Mark failed (All attempts failed)" 
# Alert administrators
```

**What to notice:**
- Events are queued immediately when triggered (step 3), ensuring no events are lost even during high load
- The retry mechanism uses exponential backoff (steps 8-10) to handle temporary network issues without overwhelming your n8n instance  
- Failed webhooks after 3 attempts trigger admin notifications (step 12) so you can investigate integration issues

### Debugging with the Executions panel

The Executions panel is one of n8n's most powerful features for debugging workflows. Every time a workflow runs - whether in test or production - n8n records the complete execution with input and output data at each node.

![n8n workflow canvas showing multiple trigger types including Webhook, Chat message, Schedule Trigger, and Execute Workflow nodes](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy/pro/n8n-workflow-canvas-triggers.png)

**Viewing execution history:**
- Click **Executions** tab at the top of the workflow editor
- Each execution shows status (success/error), timing, and trigger source
- Click any execution to see the data that flowed through each node
- Use filters to find specific executions by date or status

**Data Pinning - skip expensive operations during testing:**

When building complex workflows with AI agents or external API calls, re-running every node each time you test is slow and expensive. Data Pinning lets you "freeze" a node's output so it's reused in subsequent test runs.

To pin data:
1. Run your workflow to get real data through the nodes
2. Click on any node that has output data
3. Click the **Pin** icon to lock that output
4. Now when you test, n8n skips that node and uses the pinned data instead

This is particularly useful when:
- Testing AI agent workflows (avoid repeated LLM calls)
- Debugging nodes downstream of slow API calls
- Developing with rate-limited external services

**Copy execution to editor:**

If a production execution fails or produces unexpected results, you can load that exact execution back into the editor to debug:
1. Find the problematic execution in the Executions panel
2. Click the three-dot menu and select **Copy to Editor**
3. The workflow opens with all the original input data loaded
4. Test individual nodes or modify and re-run

### Troubleshooting guide

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| **401 Unauthorized** | Invalid or expired token | Regenerate API token in Tallyfy settings |
| **403 Forbidden** | Insufficient permissions | Check user role allows API access |
| **404 Not Found** | Wrong endpoint or missing resource | Verify Organization ID and resource IDs |
| **422 Unprocessable Entity** | Invalid data format | Check required fields and data types |
| **Rate limiting (429)** | Too many requests | Add 1-2 second delays between calls |
| **Connection timeout** | Network or server issues | Add retry logic with exponential backoff |
| **Webhook not receiving data** | URL or events misconfigured | Verify webhook URL and selected events |
| **Webhook works in test but not production** | Using Test URL instead of Production URL | Update Tallyfy to use Production URL after activating workflow |
| **AI node timing out during development** | Re-running expensive operations | Use Data Pinning to cache AI outputs while building |

**Advanced debugging:**
- Enable **Retry on Failure** in node settings
- Use **Split in Batches** for processing large datasets
- Add **Function** nodes to log request/response data
- Test authentication with the `/me` endpoint first

### Security and performance best practices

**Security:**
- Store API tokens in n8n credentials, never in code
- Use webhook secrets to verify payload authenticity
- Rotate API tokens quarterly or after team changes
- Enable n8n's IP whitelist for production environments

**Performance and reliability:**
- Use **Split in Batches** for processing 50+ items
- Add 500ms delays between API calls to avoid rate limits
- Enable **Retry on Failure** with exponential backoff
- Set appropriate timeouts (30s for complex operations)

**Monitoring and maintenance:**
- Add error notifications via email or Slack
- Log important workflow events for debugging
- Test critical workflows monthly with sample data
- Monitor n8n execution metrics and set alerts

**Data handling:**
- Use pagination for large datasets (Tallyfy returns 25 items by default)
- Validate required fields before sending API requests
- Handle edge cases like missing users or archived processes
- Cache frequently accessed data to reduce API calls

### Advanced integration patterns

Once connected, you can build sophisticated automations:

**AI-enhanced workflows:**
- Analyze form responses with AI and route processes accordingly
- Generate process summaries and executive reports using LLMs
- Automatically categorize and prioritize incoming requests

**Multi-system orchestration:**
- Launch Tallyfy processes from CRM deal updates
- Sync completed tasks back to project management tools
- Create approval workflows spanning multiple platforms

**Real-time business intelligence:**
- Stream process metrics to BI dashboards
- Send alerts when SLAs are at risk
- Generate compliance reports automatically
