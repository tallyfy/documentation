title: Handling idempotency in webhooks and API
---

## What is idempotency and why it matters

When integrating with Tallyfy's [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) and [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/), you need to design your systems to handle events that might happen multiple times. *Idempotency* means that doing the same operation multiple times gives you the same result as doing it once. This is essential for building reliable integrations.

In Tallyfy, certain actions can trigger webhooks multiple times, and external systems might send duplicate API requests. Without proper idempotency handling, you could end up with duplicate records, wrong data states, or failed operations.

## Common scenarios requiring idempotency

### Webhooks firing multiple times

Webhooks in Tallyfy can fire more than once for the same event. Here's a common example:

1. A user completes a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/)
2. Your webhook receives the "task completed" event
3. The user reopens the same task
4. The user completes it again
5. Your webhook receives another "task completed" event for the same task

Without idempotency handling, your system might:
- Create duplicate records in your database
- Send multiple notifications for the same event
- Process payments or orders twice
- Update inventory counts incorrectly

### Process-level webhooks generating multiple events

When you configure webhooks at the [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) level, they fire for every task completion within that process. This means:

- A process with 10 tasks will generate 10 webhook events
- If tasks are reopened and completed again, you'll receive additional events
- Your receiving system needs to handle this volume efficiently

### External systems sending duplicate events

Your external systems might send duplicate events to Tallyfy through the API. For example:

- A helpdesk system sends two webhook notifications for the same ticket update
- Network issues cause a retry mechanism to send the same API request twice
- A user accidentally triggers the same action multiple times in your integrated system

## Implementing idempotency strategies

### Use unique identifiers

Every webhook payload from Tallyfy includes unique identifiers. Always use these to detect duplicates:

```json
{
  "event": "task.completed",
  "task_id": "abc123",
  "process_id": "xyz789",
  "completed_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
  "completed_by": "user@example.com"
}
```

**How to implement:**
1. Store the `task_id` and `completed_at` timestamp in your database
2. Before processing a webhook, check if this combo already exists
3. If it exists, skip processing or update the existing record
4. If it's new, process the webhook normally

### Implement event deduplication

Create a deduplication table or cache to track processed events:

```sql
CREATE TABLE processed_events (
  event_id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
  event_type VARCHAR(100),
  processed_at TIMESTAMP,
  payload JSON
);
```

When you receive a webhook:
1. Generate a unique event ID by combining `task_id + event_type + timestamp`
2. Check if this event ID exists in your table
3. If not, process the event and store the ID
4. If it exists, log it and skip processing

### Design for graceful failure

When handling duplicate API requests from external systems:

1. **Return success for duplicate requests**: If an external system tries to create the same record twice, return a success response with the existing record instead of an error

2. **Use conditional updates**: When updating [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) via API, check the current value first:
   - If the value is already what you want to set, skip the update
   - If it's different, proceed with the update
   - Add a comment noting the update for audit trails

3. **Use request IDs**: Require external systems to send a unique request ID with each API call:
   ```
   X-Request-ID: unique-request-identifier-123
   ```
   Store these IDs temporarily (like for 24 hours) to detect retries

## Best practices for specific integrations

### Handling task completion webhooks

When a task is completed and potentially reopened:

1. Store the task's completion history:
   ```json
   {
     "task_id": "abc123",
     "completions": [
       {"completed_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z", "completed_by": "user1@example.com"},
       {"completed_at": "2024-01-15T14:45:00Z", "completed_by": "user2@example.com"}
     ]
   }
   ```

2. Decide on your business logic:
   - Process only the first completion
   - Process all completions but track them separately
   - Process the most recent completion only

### Managing process-level webhook volume

For processes with many tasks:

1. **Batch processing**: Collect webhook events and process them in batches every few minutes
2. **Use queues**: Set up a message queue to handle high volumes without overwhelming your system
3. **Filter by task type**: Use the webhook payload to identify specific tasks you care about

### Preventing duplicate API submissions

When external systems integrate with Tallyfy:

1. **Use idempotency keys**: Generate a unique key for each operation:
   ```
   POST /api/v1/processes/launch
   X-Idempotency-Key: ticket-12345-launch-attempt-1
   ```

2. **Use conditional requests**: Check if an action has already been done:
   - Query existing processes before launching a new one
   - Check task status before attempting to complete it
   - Verify form field values before updating them

## Example implementation patterns

### Pattern 1: Webhook processor with deduplication

```javascript
async function processWebhook(payload) {
  // Generate unique event key
  const eventKey = `${payload.task_id}-${payload.event}-${payload.timestamp}`;
  
  // Check if already processed
  const existing = await db.query('SELECT * FROM processed_events WHERE event_key = ?', [eventKey]);
  
  if (existing.length > 0) {
    console.log('Duplicate event detected, skipping:', eventKey);
    return { status: 'duplicate', message: 'Event already processed' };
  }
  
  // Process the event
  await handleEvent(payload);
  
  // Mark as processed
  await db.query('INSERT INTO processed_events (event_key, processed_at) VALUES (?, NOW())', [eventKey]);
  
  return { status: 'processed', message: 'Event processed successfully' };
}
```

### Pattern 2: API integration with retry safety

```javascript
async function updateTaskField(taskId, fieldName, fieldValue, requestId) {
  // Check if this request was already processed
  const cachedResult = await cache.get(`request:${requestId}`);
  if (cachedResult) {
    return cachedResult;
  }
  
  // Get current task state
  const task = await tallyfyApi.getTask(taskId);
  
  // Check if update is needed
  if (task.fields[fieldName] === fieldValue) {
    const result = { status: 'unchanged', message: 'Field already has the desired value' };
    await cache.set(`request:${requestId}`, result, 86400); // Cache for 24 hours
    return result;
  }
  
  // Perform update
  const updatedTask = await tallyfyApi.updateTask(taskId, {
    fields: { [fieldName]: fieldValue }
  });
  
  // Add comment for audit trail
  await tallyfyApi.addComment(taskId, 
    `Field "${fieldName}" updated to "${fieldValue}" via API integration`
  );
  
  const result = { status: 'updated', task: updatedTask };
  await cache.set(`request:${requestId}`, result, 86400);
  return result;
}
```

## Testing your idempotency implementation

To make sure your integration handles duplicates correctly:

1. **Simulate duplicate webhooks**: Manually trigger the same webhook multiple times
2. **Test network retries**: Use tools to simulate failed requests that retry automatically
3. **Check data consistency**: Make sure your data stays correct after duplicate events
4. **Watch your logs**: Look for patterns of duplicate events in production

## Troubleshooting common issues

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Duplicate records in database | Not checking for existing records before insert | Implement unique constraints and check before insert |
| Missing webhook events | Treating duplicates as errors | Log duplicates but don't fail the webhook response |
| Inconsistent data state | Processing events out of order | Use timestamps to ensure correct ordering |
| API rate limits from retries | Not caching successful responses | Implement response caching with appropriate TTL |

:::warning[Important consideration]
Always respond with a 2xx status code to webhook requests, even for duplicates. Returning error codes might cause Tallyfy to retry the webhook, creating more duplicates.

## Next steps

After setting up idempotency handling:

1. Watch your integration logs to spot patterns of duplicate events
2. Adjust your deduplication window based on actual retry patterns
3. Consider setting up more sophisticated event sourcing if you need full audit trails
4. Check Tallyfy's [webhook documentation](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) for the latest payload formats
