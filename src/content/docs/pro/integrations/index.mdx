## Connecting Tallyfy with other business systems

Tallyfy connects with your existing business software through multiple methods - from simple email integrations to sophisticated API implementations. Pick what works for your team.

Got developers? Great. Prefer clicking buttons instead of writing code? That works too.

### Integration benefits

Without integrations, you're stuck copying and pasting data between systems all day. Integrations automatically share information between systems, trigger actions across platforms, and keep everything in sync.

### Available integration methods

| Webhooks               | Medium (Configuration)   | Real-time event notifications      | Sending Tallyfy events to external systems |
| Middleware Platforms   | Low (No-code tools)      | Connect multiple apps visually     | Cross-app automation without coding |
| Computer AI Agents     | Medium (Setup)           | Automate complex UI interactions   | Legacy systems without APIs |
| Native Integrations    | Low (Configuration)      | Plug-and-play app connections      | Pre-built connections for popular platforms |
| Email Integration      | Very Low (Basic setup)   | Universal compatibility             | Basic connections and process triggering |
| Analytics Integration  | Medium (SQL/BI tools)    | Deep workflow data insights         | Business intelligence and reporting |
| Chat Platform Tools    | Low (App installation)   | Task management within chat        | Teams heavily using Slack/Teams |
| Azure Translation      | Medium (Azure setup)     | Real-time content translation      | Multilingual teams and global operations |
| Open Source Resources  | Medium-High (Development)| Code examples and community support| Developers seeking implementation guidance |
| Idempotency Handling   | Medium-High (Architecture)| Prevent duplicate operations       | All API and webhook integrations requiring reliability |

### 1. Open API Integration

The Tallyfy REST API gives developers complete control. With the API, you can:

- Build custom applications that use Tallyfy workflow data and functionality
- Exchange information bidirectionally between Tallyfy and external systems
- Automate process management - launch, update, and monitor workflows programmatically
- Manage user accounts, permissions, and organizational settings through code
- Control all Tallyfy features through custom applications and scripts


### 2. Webhooks

Webhooks automatically notify external systems the moment something happens in Tallyfy - task completed, process launched, you name it. Here's what you can do:

- Receive instant notifications in external tools when tasks complete
- Track process progress in other business systems
- Automatically send form data from Tallyfy to downstream applications
- Trigger actions in external systems based on Tallyfy events
- Configure event filtering at template and step levels for targeted notifications

:::tip[Webhook setup and testing]
**Setting up webhooks**: Navigate to your template, click on any step, and add your webhook URL in the webhook field. Test using services like RequestBin or Webhook.site first.

**Troubleshooting webhooks**:
1. Verify your URL is publicly accessible (not localhost)
2. Check that your endpoint returns a 200 status code
3. Look for webhook events in your server logs
4. Test with a simple service first before complex integrations
5. Remember webhooks fire when tasks complete, not when they're created

**Triggering Tallyfy from external systems**:
To launch processes from external forms or capture guest data:
1. Use the API's process launch endpoint
2. Pass form data as kick-off form values
3. Include guest email in the payload for auto-assignment
4. Webhooks can notify your system when process starts
5. Perfect for lead capture, onboarding automation, and external form integration

### 3. Middleware Platforms

Can't code? No problem. Middleware platforms like Zapier, Make, and Power Automate connect Tallyfy to thousands of business applications through visual, drag-and-drop interfaces. You can:

- Use pre-built connections for popular applications without writing code
- Create integrations using visual workflow builders
- Transform data formats between different systems automatically  
- Build conditional logic (IF-THEN statements) for intelligent workflows
- Rely on platform-managed updates and maintenance


**Examples:** Zapier, Microsoft Power Automate, Make.com, Workato, Tray.io

**Popular middleware options:**

- **[Zapier](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/zapier/)**
- **[n8n](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/n8n/)**
- **[Power Automate](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/)**

:::note[Choosing a Middleware Tool]
Zapier is popular for simple links, but for more complex or higher-volume connections, tools like **Make.com** or **Microsoft Power Automate** are often more powerful and better value.

If you have developers, using Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) directly gives the most control and flexibility.

### 4. Computer AI Agents

Remember that ancient software your company refuses to replace? The one with no API? Computer AI Agents can control it like a human would - interpreting screens, clicking buttons, and filling forms automatically. Perfect for:

- Legacy systems without APIs or complex integration challenges
- Dynamic web pages and interfaces that change frequently
- Multi-step tasks requiring contextual understanding of screen content
- Adapting to interface changes without code modifications
- Systems where traditional API integration isn't feasible or cost-effective


**Examples:** Claude Computer Use, Twin.so, Skyvern, Manus AI

:::note[Starting with Computer AI Agents]
Computer AI Agents work best for **short, bite-sized tasks** that are mundane and repetitive. Don't start with complex, goal-driven jobs as they can be expensive and unpredictable. Focus on simple data entry, form filling, or information extraction from legacy systems first.

### 11. Idempotency handling for reliable integrations

Here's a problem nobody talks about - duplicate events. When building integrations with [Tallyfy's API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) or [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/), you'll face this challenge:

- Webhooks can fire multiple times for the same event (task completed, reopened, then completed again)
- External systems might send duplicate API requests
- Process-level webhooks generate many events requiring careful handling
- Without idempotency, you risk duplicate records, incorrect data, or failed operations

Learn [how to handle idempotency](/products/pro/integrations/handling-idempotency-in-webhooks-and-api/) and build it right the first time.

:::note[Future Exploration: Interactive Email Actions]
Tallyfy is also exploring future enhancements like [interactive email actions](/products/pro/integrations/interactive-email-actions/), which could allow users to complete certain tasks directly from within supported email clients like Outlook and Gmail.

### 12. AI-powered code generation

If your team has developers and clear requirements, AI can draft working integration code fast. Use AI generation when you want custom logic beyond middleware but need speed.

**Why use it**

- Working integration code in 10-20 minutes
- Clear, maintainable structure with logging and error handling
- Fits your preferred language (for example, Python or JavaScript)

**How it works**

1. Write a precise specification of the workflow and data mappings
2. Use your AI assistant to generate code that calls Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/)
3. Review, test, and deploy
4. Iterate as requirements evolve

**Example scenario**: A logistics team needs shipping workflows that vary by weight, destination, and carrier. A developer describes the rules, generates Python code, and ships the first version the same day.

:::tip[Start with AI, refine with developers]
Use AI to scaffold 70-80% of the code, then have engineers polish and harden it. You get speed without sacrificing quality.
:::

### Choosing the right approach

Ask these four questions:

1. **Do you have developers available?** Yes â API or AI. No â Middleware.
2. **Is this one-time or ongoing?** One-time â AI. Ongoing â Plan for who maintains it.
3. **How complex is the logic?** Simple if-this-then-that â Middleware. Complex â API or AI.
4. **What is your timeline?** Need it this week â Middleware or AI. Have a month â API for maximum control.

### Integration approach comparison matrix

| Factor | Direct API | Middleware | AI Code Generation |
|--------|------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Technical skill required** | High (developers) | Low (no-code) | Medium (review code) |
| **Setup time** | Days to weeks | Hours to days | Hours to days |
| **Customization level** | Unlimited | Limited by platform | High |
| **Ongoing maintenance** | Code updates needed | Platform manages | Code updates needed |
| **Cost** | Development time | Monthly subscription | AI tool + dev time |
| **Performance** | Fastest | Good | Fast |
| **Best for** | Complex, high-volume | Standard workflows | Custom but quick |

### Can I combine multiple approaches?

Absolutely. Many teams mix and match:

- **Middleware + API**: Keep simple automations in middleware while sending high-volume or complex work direct to the API
- **AI + Middleware**: Let AI build lightweight endpoints, then wire them up via middleware
- **Phased approach**: Start with middleware for speed, then migrate heavy-duty parts to API later

:::note[Migration is always possible]
You're never locked in. Start with middleware to get value quickly, then move to direct API when scale or complexity grows.
