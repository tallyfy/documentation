## How to connect Tallyfy with your other business systems

Tallyfy provides multiple integration approaches to connect your workflow processes with other business systems. Each method offers different capabilities, complexity levels, and technical requirements to suit various organizational needs.

### Available integration methods

| Integration Method | Technical Complexity | Key Benefit | Best For |
|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|----------|
| Open API | High | Complete customization | Development teams |
| Webhooks | Medium | Real-time notifications | Event-driven systems |
| Middleware | Low | No-code connectivity | Business users |
| Native Integrations | Low | Simplified setup | Quick deployment |
| Email | Very Low | Universal compatibility | Any organization |
| Analytics | Medium | Data-driven insights | Reporting needs |
| Chat Platforms | Low | Conversation to action | Collaborative teams |
| Azure Translation | Medium | Multilingual content | Global teams |
| Open Source | Medium-High | Community resources | Custom solutions |

### 1. Open API

The [REST API](https://go.tallyfy.com/api/) offers programmatic access to Tallyfy's functionality, enabling:

- **Custom application development** - Build tailored solutions for your organization
- **Bidirectional data exchange** - Move information in and out of Tallyfy
- **Automated process management** - Programmatically create and control workflows
- **User provisioning** - Manage user accounts and permissions systematically
- **Platform control** - Access Tallyfy features programmatically

### 2. Webhooks

Tallyfy's webhook system sends JSON data packets to external endpoints when specific events occur:

- **Real-time notifications** - Receive immediate alerts when tasks are completed
- **Process status tracking** - Monitor workflow progress in external systems
- **Form data transmission** - Capture and utilize form field data automatically
- **Automated triggers** - Initiate actions in connected systems
- **Selective event monitoring** - Configure webhooks at template or step level

### 3. Middleware platforms

Integration platforms connect Tallyfy to other applications without custom coding:

- **Pre-built connectors** - Access thousands of ready-made application connections
- **Visual workflow builders** - Create integrations with drag-and-drop interfaces
- **Data transformation** - Map and convert information between systems
- **Logic implementation** - Apply conditional rules and data processing
- **Automatic updates** - Receive automatic updates and compatibility fixes

**Supported platforms include:** Zapier, Microsoft Power Automate, Make (formerly Integromat), Workato, and Tray.io

:::note[Considering Integration Alternatives]
While Zapier can be useful for simple connections, we generally recommend more capable and cost-effective middleware solutions like **n8n**, **Make**, or **Microsoft Power Automate** for serious integrations.

For maximum control and flexibility, especially if you have development resources, consider using Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) to build custom integrations, potentially leveraging AI to generate code for serverless functions.
