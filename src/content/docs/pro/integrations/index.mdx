## How to connect Tallyfy with your other business systems

Tallyfy can connect with other software your business uses. There are several ways to do this, from simple email connections to custom coding, depending on what you need and your technical resources.

### Different ways to connect Tallyfy

| Azure Translation      | Medium (Setup)         | Translate content inside Tallyfy   | Teams working in multiple languages |
| Open Source Resources  | Medium-High (Coding)   | Code examples, community help      | Developers looking for code samples |

### 1. Open API (For Developers)

The [Tallyfy REST API](https://go.tallyfy.com/api/) lets developers use code to interact with Tallyfy directly. This allows:

- Building custom apps that use Tallyfy data.
- Sending information back and forth between Tallyfy and other systems.
- Automatically managing processes (starting, updating).
- Managing user accounts with code.
- Controlling Tallyfy features through your own programs.

### 2. Webhooks (Notifications FROM Tallyfy)

Webhooks automatically send information *from* Tallyfy to other systems when specific things happen (like a task finishing).

- Get instant alerts in other tools when tasks are done.
- Track process progress in other systems.
- Send data collected in Tallyfy forms to other apps automatically.
- Trigger actions in other systems based on Tallyfy events.
- Choose exactly which events (at the template or step level) send out a webhook.

### 3. Middleware Platforms (Connecting Apps Without Code)

Tools like Zapier, Make, Power Automate, etc., act as bridges connecting Tallyfy to thousands of other apps.

- Use ready-made connections for popular apps.
- Build connections visually (drag-and-drop).
- Change data format between systems.
- Add simple logic (like IF statements) to your connections.
- The middleware platform handles updates and keeping connections working.

**Examples:** Zapier, Microsoft Power Automate, Make.com, Workato, Tray.io

:::note[Choosing a Middleware Tool]
Zapier is popular for simple links, but for more complex or higher-volume connections, tools like **Make.com** or **Microsoft Power Automate** are often more powerful and better value.

If you have developers, using Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) directly gives the most control and flexibility.

### 4. Native Integrations (Built by Tallyfy)

### 6. Analytics Connection

Tallyfy Analytics exports your process data so you can analyze it with business intelligence (BI) tools.

- Use standard SQL to query your Tallyfy data (via Amazon Athena).
- Connect reporting tools like Power BI, Tableau, Looker, etc.

- Translate task instructions, comments, etc., in real-time.
- Let team members use Tallyfy in their preferred language.
- Each user can set their own language.
- Uses Microsoft's AI translation.
- Make processes usable for global teams.
