## Integration Methods

Tallyfy offers multiple integration methods to connect with other systems:

### 1. Open API

The [open REST API](https://go.tallyfy.com/api/) provides developers with comprehensive access to all Tallyfy features, enabling bidirectional data transfer.

### 2. Webhooks

Outbound JSON webhooks deliver the complete payload of a process to any internet-accessible endpoint specified by the user.

### 3. Middleware

Integration platforms with pre-built connectors facilitate data movement between applications without coding requirements. These solutions eliminate the need to develop and maintain custom integration code.

### 4. Native Integrations

Tallyfy maintains certain native integrations that are managed and updated directly by the Tallyfy team.

### 5. Email Integration

Users can trigger actions like process launching by sending emails to pre-defined addresses. Custom SMTP configuration is also supported for using organization-specific email servers. A [Gmail plugin](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/tallyfy/671710262095) is available for Google Workspace users.

### 6. Analytics

Tallyfy Analytics provides a data warehouse service on Amazon Athena, enabling users to query process data from any business intelligence tool or analytics system.

### 7. Chat Platforms

Tallyfy offers chat platform integrations, including a [Slack plugin](https://go.tallyfy.com/api/functions/slack/oauth2/install) for team collaboration.

### 8. Open Source Resources

Tallyfy maintains an [open source repository](https://github.com/tallyfy/api-support) containing tools, scripts, and plugins to support integration efforts.
