## How to connect Tallyfy with your other business systems

Tallyfy can connect with other software your business uses. There are several ways to do this, from simple email connections to custom coding, depending on what you need and your technical resources.

### Why integrations matter

Integrations are crucial because they allow Tallyfy to become part of your larger business ecosystem rather than an isolated tool. Without integrations, you'd need to manually transfer data between systems, leading to duplicated effort, delays, and potential errors. Good integrations eliminate these problems by automatically sharing information, triggering actions across systems, and creating a seamless experience for users. This connectivity transforms Tallyfy from a standalone workflow tool into a central hub that coordinates with all your other business applications.

### Different ways to connect Tallyfy

| Connection Method      | Technical Skill Needed | Main Benefit                       | Best For |
|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------|----------|
| Open API               | High (Coding)          | Total control, custom solutions    | Developers building custom integrations |
| Webhooks               | Medium (Some setup)    | Real-time updates *from* Tallyfy   | Sending Tallyfy events to other systems |
| Middleware             | Low (No-code tools)    | Connecting many apps easily        | Connecting apps without coding |
| Native Integrations    | Low                    | Simple setup for specific apps     | Using Tallyfy's pre-built connections |
| Email                  | Very Low               | Works with anything              | Basic connections, starting processes |
| Analytics              | Medium (SQL/BI Tools)  | Deep insights from Tallyfy data    | Creating reports and dashboards |
| Chat Platforms         | Low                    | Manage tasks from chat (e.g., Slack) | Teams using Slack/chat heavily |
| Azure Translation      | Medium (Setup)         | Translate content inside Tallyfy   | Teams working in multiple languages |
| Open Source Resources  | Medium-High (Coding)   | Code examples, community help      | Developers looking for code samples |
| Idempotency Handling   | Medium-High (Design)   | Prevent duplicate operations       | All API and webhook integrations |

### 1. Open API

The [Tallyfy REST API](https://go.tallyfy.com/api/) lets developers use code to interact with Tallyfy directly. This allows:

- Building custom apps that use Tallyfy data.
- Sending information back and forth between Tallyfy and other systems.
- Automatically managing processes (starting, updating).
- Managing user accounts with code.
- Controlling Tallyfy features through your own programs.

### 2. Webhooks for notifications from Tallyfy

Webhooks automatically send information *from* Tallyfy to other systems when specific things happen (like a task finishing).

- Get instant alerts in other tools when tasks are done.
- Track process progress in other systems.
- Send data collected in Tallyfy forms to other apps automatically.
- Trigger actions in other systems based on Tallyfy events.
- Choose exactly which events (at the template or step level) send out a webhook.

### 3. Middleware platforms for connecting apps without code

Tools like Zapier, Make, Power Automate, etc., act as bridges connecting Tallyfy to thousands of other apps.

- Use ready-made connections for popular apps.
- Build connections visually (drag-and-drop).
- Change data format between systems.
- Add simple logic (like IF statements) to your connections.
- The middleware platform handles updates and keeping connections working.

**Examples:** Zapier, Microsoft Power Automate, Make.com, Workato, Tray.io

:::note[Choosing a Middleware Tool]
Zapier is popular for simple links, but for more complex or higher-volume connections, tools like **Make.com** or **Microsoft Power Automate** are often more powerful and better value.

If you have developers, using Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) directly gives the most control and flexibility.

### 4. Native integrations built by Tallyfy

These are specific connections Tallyfy has built to work with certain other platforms.

- Officially supported and tested by Tallyfy.
- Often easier to set up than other methods.
- Designed for common connection needs.
- Kept up-to-date by Tallyfy.
- Get support directly from Tallyfy if issues arise.

### 5. Email Integration

You can interact with Tallyfy using email:

- Start processes by sending an email to a special Tallyfy address.
- Set up Tallyfy emails to come from your company's email server (Custom SMTP).
- Use the Tallyfy Gmail add-on to manage tasks from your inbox.
- Works with any standard email system.
- Very easy to set up.

**Featured:** [Gmail plugin](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/tallyfy/671710262095) for managing workflows in Gmail.

### 6. Analytics Connection

Tallyfy Analytics exports your process data so you can analyze it with business intelligence (BI) tools.

- Use standard SQL to query your Tallyfy data (via Amazon Athena).
- Connect reporting tools like Power BI, Tableau, Looker, etc.
- Build custom dashboards and reports.
- Analyze process performance to find bottlenecks.
- Look at historical data and trends.

### 7. Chat platform integration (e.g., Slack)

Connect Tallyfy to your team chat app.

- Create Tallyfy tasks from chat messages.
- Start Tallyfy processes from within the chat app.
- Get Tallyfy status updates posted to chat channels.
- Keep conversations linked to related tasks.
- Improve team visibility on workflows.

**Featured:** [Slack plugin](https://go.tallyfy.com/api/functions/slack/oauth2/install) for managing tasks in Slack.

### 8. Azure Translation Services

Connect Tallyfy to Microsoft Azure AI to automatically translate content.

- Translate task instructions, comments, etc., in real-time.
- Let team members use Tallyfy in their preferred language.
- Each user can set their own language.
- Uses Microsoft's AI translation.
- Make processes usable for global teams.

**Featured:** [Content translation](/products/pro/integrations/azure-translation/) for text entered by users.

### 9. Open source resources for developers

Tallyfy provides code examples and tools on [GitHub](https://github.com/tallyfy/api-support) for developers.

- Sample code for common integration tasks.
- Helper scripts.
- Technical guides.
- Examples to adapt for your own custom solutions.

### 10. Idempotency handling for reliable integrations

When building integrations with [Tallyfy's API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) or [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/), you need to handle duplicate events properly.

- Webhooks can fire multiple times for the same event (e.g., task completed, reopened, completed again).
- External systems might send duplicate API requests.
- Process-level webhooks generate many events that need proper handling.
- Without idempotency, you risk duplicate records, incorrect data, or failed operations.
- Learn [how to handle idempotency](/products/pro/integrations/handling-idempotency-in-webhooks-and-api/) to build reliable integrations.

:::note[Future Exploration: Interactive Email Actions]
Tallyfy is also exploring future enhancements like [interactive email actions](/products/pro/integrations/interactive-email-actions/), which could allow users to complete certain tasks directly from within supported email clients like Outlook and Gmail.
