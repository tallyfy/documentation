## How can I connect Tallyfy with other business systems for comprehensive automation?

Tallyfy connects with your existing business software through multiple methods - from simple email integrations to sophisticated API implementations. Pick what works for your team.

Got developers? Great. Prefer clicking buttons instead of writing code? That works too. This flexibility transforms Tallyfy into a central hub that coordinates workflows across your entire technology stack.

### Why are Tallyfy integrations essential for organizational success?

Without integrations, you're stuck copying and pasting data between systems all day. It's exhausting. Worse - you'll make mistakes that cost time and money.

Well-designed integrations fix this mess. They automatically share information between systems, trigger actions across platforms, and create seamless experiences for your team. Tallyfy becomes the operational backbone that keeps everything in sync.

### What integration methods does Tallyfy offer for different technical needs?

### 1. How does Open API Integration enable custom development?

The Tallyfy REST API gives developers complete control. With the API, you can:

- Build custom applications that use Tallyfy workflow data and functionality
- Exchange information bidirectionally between Tallyfy and external systems
- Automate process management - launch, update, and monitor workflows programmatically
- Manage user accounts, permissions, and organizational settings through code
- Control all Tallyfy features through custom applications and scripts

Think of it as having direct access to Tallyfy's brain - you can make it do anything your business needs.

### 2. How do Webhooks enable real-time event notifications?

Webhooks automatically notify external systems the moment something happens in Tallyfy - task completed, process launched, you name it. Here's what you can do:

- Receive instant notifications in external tools when tasks complete
- Track process progress in other business systems
- Automatically send form data from Tallyfy to downstream applications
- Trigger actions in external systems based on Tallyfy events
- Configure event filtering at template and step levels for targeted notifications

No more waiting. No more polling. External systems react instantly to Tallyfy events.

### 3. How do Middleware Platforms enable no-code integration?

Can't code? No problem. Middleware platforms like Zapier, Make, and Power Automate connect Tallyfy to thousands of business applications through visual, drag-and-drop interfaces. You can:

- Use pre-built connections for popular applications without writing code
- Create integrations using visual workflow builders
- Transform data formats between different systems automatically  
- Build conditional logic (IF-THEN statements) for intelligent workflows
- Rely on platform-managed updates and maintenance

It's like playing with digital Legos - connect the pieces and watch the magic happen.

**Examples:** Zapier, Microsoft Power Automate, Make.com, Workato, Tray.io

**Popular middleware options:**

- **[Zapier](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/zapier/)**
- **[n8n](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/n8n/)**
- **[Power Automate](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/)**

:::note[Choosing a Middleware Tool]
Zapier is popular for simple links, but for more complex or higher-volume connections, tools like **Make.com** or **Microsoft Power Automate** are often more powerful and better value.

If you have developers, using Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) directly gives the most control and flexibility.

### 4. How do Computer AI Agents automate legacy system interactions?

Remember that ancient software your company refuses to replace? The one with no API? Computer AI Agents can control it like a human would - interpreting screens, clicking buttons, and filling forms automatically. Perfect for:

- Legacy systems without APIs or complex integration challenges
- Dynamic web pages and interfaces that change frequently
- Multi-step tasks requiring contextual understanding of screen content
- Adapting to interface changes without code modifications
- Systems where traditional API integration isn't feasible or cost-effective

Finally - a way to connect that 20-year-old system to your modern workflows.

**Examples:** Claude Computer Use, Twin.so, Skyvern, Manus AI

:::note[Starting with Computer AI Agents]
Computer AI Agents work best for **short, bite-sized tasks** that are mundane and repetitive. Don't start with complex, goal-driven jobs as they can be expensive and unpredictable. Focus on simple data entry, form filling, or information extraction from legacy systems first.

### 5. Native integrations built by Tallyfy

Native integrations are pre-built connections Tallyfy maintains for specific platforms. They just work:

- Official support and testing by Tallyfy
- Simplified setup compared to custom integrations
- Designed for common use cases
- Automatic updates maintained by Tallyfy
- Direct support from Tallyfy if issues arise

### 6. Email Integration

Everyone has email, right? That's why email integration is brilliant:

- Start processes by sending emails to dedicated Tallyfy addresses
- Configure Tallyfy to send emails from your company's email server (Custom SMTP)
- Use the Tallyfy Gmail add-on to manage tasks directly from your inbox
- Connect with any standard email system
- Set up quickly without technical expertise

Takes 5 minutes to configure. Works forever.

**Featured:** [Gmail plugin](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/tallyfy/671710262095) for managing workflows in Gmail.

### 7. Analytics Connection

Want to know where your processes get stuck? Tallyfy Analytics exports process data for deep analysis with business intelligence tools:

- Query Tallyfy data using standard SQL (via Amazon Athena)
- Connect reporting tools like Power BI, Tableau, and Looker
- Build custom dashboards and reports

- Track historical data and trends over time

Your data. Your way. No black boxes.

### 8. Chat platform integration (e.g., Slack)

Your team lives in Slack? Keep them there. Connect Tallyfy to your chat platforms:

- Create Tallyfy tasks directly from chat messages
- Launch processes without leaving your chat app
- Receive status updates posted to relevant channels
- Link conversations to their related tasks
- Increase team visibility on workflow progress

No context switching. Everything happens where your team already works.

- Sample code for common integration tasks
- Helper scripts and utilities
- Technical implementation guides
- Examples you can adapt for custom solutions

Copy, paste, modify. Ship faster.

### 11. Idempotency handling for reliable integrations

Here's a problem nobody talks about - duplicate events. When building integrations with [Tallyfy's API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) or [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/), you'll face this challenge:

- Webhooks can fire multiple times for the same event (task completed, reopened, then completed again)
- External systems might send duplicate API requests
- Process-level webhooks generate many events requiring careful handling
- Without idempotency, you risk duplicate records, incorrect data, or failed operations

Skip this step? Your integration breaks in weird ways. Learn [how to handle idempotency](/products/pro/integrations/handling-idempotency-in-webhooks-and-api/) and build it right the first time.

:::note[Future Exploration: Interactive Email Actions]
Tallyfy is also exploring future enhancements like [interactive email actions](/products/pro/integrations/interactive-email-actions/), which could allow users to complete certain tasks directly from within supported email clients like Outlook and Gmail.

### 12. How does AI-powered code generation accelerate integrations?

If your team has developers and clear requirements, AI can draft working integration code fast. Use AI generation when you want custom logic beyond middleware but need speed.

**Why use it**

- Working integration code in 10-20 minutes
- Clear, maintainable structure with logging and error handling
- Fits your preferred language (for example, Python or JavaScript)

**How it works**

1. Write a precise specification of the workflow and data mappings
2. Use your AI assistant to generate code that calls Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/)
3. Review, test, and deploy
4. Iterate as requirements evolve

**Example scenario**: A logistics team needs shipping workflows that vary by weight, destination, and carrier. A developer describes the rules, generates Python code, and ships the first version the same day.

:::tip[Start with AI, refine with developers]
Use AI to scaffold 70-80% of the code, then have engineers polish and harden it. You get speed without sacrificing quality.
:::

### How do I decide which approach is right for me?

Ask these four questions:

1. **Do you have developers available?** Yes â API or AI. No â Middleware.
2. **Is this one-time or ongoing?** One-time â AI. Ongoing â Plan for who maintains it.
3. **How complex is the logic?** Simple if-this-then-that â Middleware. Complex â API or AI.
4. **What is your timeline?** Need it this week â Middleware or AI. Have a month â API for maximum control.

### Integration approach comparison matrix

| Factor | Direct API | Middleware | AI Code Generation |
|--------|------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Technical skill required** | High (developers) | Low (no-code) | Medium (review code) |
| **Setup time** | Days to weeks | Hours to days | Hours to days |
| **Customization level** | Unlimited | Limited by platform | High |
| **Ongoing maintenance** | Code updates needed | Platform manages | Code updates needed |
| **Cost** | Development time | Monthly subscription | AI tool + dev time |
| **Performance** | Fastest | Good | Fast |
| **Best for** | Complex, high-volume | Standard workflows | Custom but quick |

### Can I combine multiple approaches?

Absolutely. Many teams mix and match:

- **Middleware + API**: Keep simple automations in middleware while sending high-volume or complex work direct to the API
- **AI + Middleware**: Let AI build lightweight endpoints, then wire them up via middleware
- **Phased approach**: Start with middleware for speed, then migrate heavy-duty parts to API later

:::note[Migration is always possible]
You're never locked in. Start with middleware to get value quickly, then move to direct API when scale or complexity grows.
