## Connecting Tallyfy with other business systems

![Integrations overview visualized as Tallyfy at the center connected by flowing data streams to various business application icons arranged in a circle - representing the multiple ways to connect and automate across your software tools](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/illustrations/integrations-overview.jpeg)

Tallyfy connects with your existing business software through multiple methods - from simple email integrations to full API implementations. Pick what works for your team, whether you've got developers or prefer clicking buttons instead of writing code.

### Why integrate?

Without integrations, you're stuck copying and pasting data between systems all day. Integrations automatically share data between systems, trigger actions across platforms, and keep everything in sync.

### Available integration methods

| Integration method | Skill required | Primary benefit | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|
| Open API | High (Development) | Complete control, custom solutions | Custom integrations with full flexibility |
| Webhooks | Medium (Configuration) | Real-time event notifications | Sending Tallyfy events to external systems |
| Middleware Platforms | Low (No-code tools) | Connect multiple apps visually | Cross-app automation without coding |
| BYO AI (Coming Soon) | Low (OAuth setup) | Use your AI subscription in tasks | Automate decisions and content generation |
| Computer AI Agents | Medium (Setup) | Automate UI interactions | Legacy systems without APIs |
| Native Integrations | Low (Configuration) | Plug-and-play connections | Pre-built connections for popular platforms |
| Email Integration | Very Low (Basic setup) | Universal compatibility | Basic connections and process triggering |
| Analytics Integration | Medium (SQL/BI tools) | Workflow data insights | Business intelligence and reporting |
| Chat Platform Tools | Low (App installation) | Task management within chat | Teams using Slack/Teams heavily |
| Azure Translation | Medium (Azure setup) | Real-time content translation | Multilingual and global teams |
| Open Source Resources | Medium-High (Development) | Code examples and community support | Developers seeking implementation guidance |
| Idempotency Handling | Medium-High (Architecture) | Prevent duplicate operations | API and webhook integrations needing reliability |

### 1. Open API integration

Tallyfy's REST API gives developers complete control:

- Build custom apps using Tallyfy workflow data and functionality
- Exchange data bidirectionally between Tallyfy and external systems
- Launch, update, and monitor workflows programmatically
- Manage users, permissions, and org settings through code

### 2. Webhooks

Webhooks notify external systems the moment something happens in Tallyfy - a task completes, a process launches or finishes, and more.

- Get instant notifications when tasks complete or processes launch/finish
- Automatically send form data to downstream applications
- Trigger actions in external systems based on Tallyfy events
- Configure webhooks at template and step levels for targeted notifications

:::tip[Webhook setup and testing]
**Setting up webhooks**: Open your template, click on any step, and add your webhook URL in the webhook field. You can also set webhooks via automated actions. Test using services like RequestBin or Webhook.site first.

**Troubleshooting webhooks**:
1. Verify your URL is publicly accessible (not localhost)
2. Check that your endpoint returns a 200 status code
3. Look for webhook events in your server logs
4. Test with a simple service first before wiring up real integrations
5. Task-level webhooks fire when tasks complete. Process-level webhooks fire when a process is launched or completed.

**Triggering Tallyfy from external systems**:
To launch processes from external forms or capture guest data:
1. Use the API's process launch endpoint
2. Pass form data as kick-off form values
3. Include guest email in the payload for auto-assignment
4. Webhooks can notify your system when the process starts

### 3. Middleware platforms

Can't code? No problem. Middleware platforms like Zapier, Make, and Power Automate connect Tallyfy to thousands of apps through visual, drag-and-drop interfaces:

- Use pre-built connections without writing code
- Create integrations using visual workflow builders
- Transform data formats between systems automatically
- Build conditional logic (IF-THEN rules) for smarter workflows

**Examples:** Zapier, Microsoft Power Automate, Make.com, Workato, Tray.io

### 4. BYO AI integration (coming soon)

[BYO AI (Bring Your Own AI)](/products/pro/integrations/byo-ai/) lets you connect your existing ChatGPT, Claude, or Microsoft Copilot subscriptions directly to Tallyfy. Your AI becomes a team member that can:

- Automatically complete tasks based on context and instructions
- Generate content like emails, reports, and summaries
- Make decisions and route workflows intelligently
- Analyze data and provide recommendations

No separate AI costs. No prompt engineering skills needed. Just connect your subscription and let AI handle the repetitive work.

**Popular middleware options:**

- **[Zapier](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/zapier/)**
- **[n8n](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/n8n/)**
- **[Power Automate](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/power-automate/)**

:::note[Choosing a middleware tool]
Zapier is popular for simple links, but for higher-volume or more complex connections, **Make.com** or **Microsoft Power Automate** are often more powerful and better value.

If you have developers, using Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) directly gives the most control.

### 5. Computer AI agents

Got ancient software with no API? Computer AI Agents can control it like a human would - interpreting screens, clicking buttons, and filling forms automatically. Good for:

- Legacy systems without APIs
- Dynamic web pages that change frequently
- Multi-step tasks requiring screen context understanding
- Systems where traditional API integration isn't feasible

**Examples:** Claude Computer Use, Twin.so, Skyvern, Manus AI

:::note[Starting with computer AI agents]
Computer AI Agents work best for **short, repetitive tasks**. Don't start with complex, goal-driven jobs - they can be expensive and unpredictable. Focus on simple data entry, form filling, or information extraction first.

### 6. Native integrations built by Tallyfy

Pre-built connections Tallyfy maintains for specific platforms:

- Official support and testing by Tallyfy
- Simpler setup than custom integrations
- Automatic updates maintained by Tallyfy
- Direct support if issues arise

### 7. Email integration

Everyone has email - that's why email integration works so well:

- Start processes by sending emails to dedicated Tallyfy addresses
- Configure Tallyfy to send emails from your company's email server (custom SMTP)
- Use the Tallyfy Gmail add-on to manage tasks from your inbox
- Connect with any standard email system

**Featured:** [Gmail plugin](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/tallyfy/671710262095) for managing workflows in Gmail.

### 8. Analytics connection

Want to know where your processes get stuck? Tallyfy Analytics exports process data for analysis with BI tools:

- Query Tallyfy data using standard SQL (via Amazon Athena)
- Connect reporting tools like Power BI, Tableau, and Looker
- Build custom dashboards and reports
- Identify bottlenecks through performance analysis

### 9. Chat platform integration (e.g. Slack)

Your team lives in Slack? Keep them there:

- Create Tallyfy tasks directly from chat messages
- Launch processes without leaving your chat app
- Receive status updates in relevant channels
- Link conversations to related tasks

**Featured:** [Slack plugin](https://go.tallyfy.com/api/functions/slack/oauth2/install) for managing tasks in Slack.

### 10. Azure Translation services

Got team members in Tokyo, Paris, and Sao Paulo? Azure Translation breaks down language barriers:

- Translate task instructions and comments in real-time
- Let team members work in their preferred language
- Allow each user to set individual language preferences
- Use Microsoft's AI-powered translation technology
- Meet [global workplace language requirements](/products/pro/integrations/azure-translation/global-workplace-language-requirements/) in different countries

**Featured:** [Content translation](/products/pro/integrations/azure-translation/) for text entered by users.

### 11. Open source resources for developers

Check out Tallyfy's [GitHub](https://github.com/tallyfy/api-support) repository for:

- Sample code for common integration tasks
- Helper scripts and utilities
- Technical implementation guides
- Examples you can adapt for custom solutions

### 12. Idempotency handling for reliable integrations

Duplicate events are a real problem. When building integrations with [Tallyfy's API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) or [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/), watch out for:

- Webhooks can fire multiple times for the same event (task completed, reopened, then completed again)
- External systems might send duplicate API requests
- Process-level webhooks generate many events that need careful handling
- Without idempotency, you risk duplicate records, incorrect data, or failed operations

Learn [how to handle idempotency](/products/pro/integrations/handling-idempotency-in-webhooks-and-api/) and build it right the first time.

:::note[Future: interactive email actions]
Tallyfy is exploring [interactive email actions](/products/pro/integrations/interactive-email-actions/), which could let users complete certain tasks directly from email clients like Outlook and Gmail.

### 13. AI-powered code generation

If your team has developers and clear requirements, AI can draft working integration code fast. Use this when you want custom logic beyond middleware but need speed.

**Why use it**

- Working integration code in 10-20 minutes
- Clear, maintainable structure with logging and error handling
- Fits your preferred language (e.g. Python or JavaScript)

**How it works**

1. Write a precise spec of the workflow and data mappings
2. Use your AI assistant to generate code that calls Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/)
3. Review, test, and deploy
4. Iterate as requirements evolve

**Example scenario**: A logistics team needs shipping workflows that vary by weight, destination, and carrier. A developer describes the rules, generates Python code, and ships the first version the same day.

:::tip[Start with AI, refine with developers]
Use AI to scaffold 70-80% of the code, then have engineers polish and harden it. You get speed without sacrificing quality.
:::

### Choosing the right approach

Ask these four questions:

1. **Do you have developers?** Yes - API or AI. No - Middleware.
2. **One-time or ongoing?** One-time - AI. Ongoing - plan for who maintains it.
3. **How complex?** Simple if-this-then-that - Middleware. Complex - API or AI.
4. **Timeline?** This week - Middleware or AI. Have a month - API for maximum control.

### Integration approach comparison

| Factor | Direct API | Middleware | AI Code Generation |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Skill required** | High (developers) | Low (no-code) | Medium (review code) |
| **Setup time** | Days to weeks | Hours to days | Hours to days |
| **Customization** | Unlimited | Limited by platform | High |
| **Maintenance** | Code updates needed | Platform manages | Code updates needed |
| **Cost** | Development time | Monthly subscription | AI tool + dev time |
| **Best for** | Complex, high-volume | Standard workflows | Custom but quick |

### Can I combine multiple approaches?

Yes. Many teams mix and match:

- **Middleware + API**: Simple automations in middleware, high-volume or complex work via the API
- **AI + Middleware**: AI builds lightweight endpoints, middleware wires them up
- **Phased approach**: Start with middleware for speed, migrate heavy-duty parts to API later

:::note[Migration is always possible]
You're never locked in. Start with middleware to get value quickly, then move to the API when scale or complexity grows.
