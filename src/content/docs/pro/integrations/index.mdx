## How do you integrate to other systems?

Tallyfy offers integration to other systems via these methods:

1. **Open API**. Our [open REST API](https://go.tallyfy.com/api/) gives any developer access to all the features of Tallyfy, and enables pushing and pulling of any type of data.
2. **Webhooks**. These are outbound JSON webhooks which take the full payload of a process and send it to any internet-accessible endpoint that you specify.
3. **Middleware**. These are platforms with connectors that help you move data from one app to another app - usually without using code. Their benefit is that you don't have to write or maintain code to keep two systems integrated.
4. **Native**. We maintain some native integrations which we offer, manage and upgrade ourselves.
5. **Email**. You can send an email to a pre-defined email addresses into Tallyfy to take certain actions like launching a process. You can also take over our email servers with yours using custom SMTP. We also have a [Gmail plugin](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/tallyfy/671710262095).
6. **Analytics**. Tallyfy Analytics is a data warehouse service on Amazon Athena that gives you access to query all your process data from any system of your choice, including BI tools.
7. **Chat**. One of our chat integrations is to Slack. You can install our [Slack plugin](https://go.tallyfy.com/api/functions/slack/oauth2/install).
8. **Open Source**. We also maintain an [open source repo](https://github.com/tallyfy/api-support) for tools, scripts and plugins.
