## How can I connect Tallyfy with other business systems for comprehensive automation?

Tallyfy connects with your existing business software through multiple methods - from simple email integrations to sophisticated API implementations. You can choose the integration approach that matches your technical resources and business needs.

Organizations of any size can connect Tallyfy to their systems, whether they have developers or prefer no-code solutions. This flexibility transforms Tallyfy into a central hub that coordinates workflows across your entire technology stack.

### Why are Tallyfy integrations essential for organizational success?

Integrations transform Tallyfy from a standalone workflow tool into your central business process hub. Without integrations, you're stuck manually transferring data between systems - wasting time and increasing errors.

Well-designed integrations eliminate these problems. They automatically share information between systems, trigger actions across platforms, and create seamless experiences for your team. Tallyfy becomes the operational backbone that coordinates all your business applications.

### What integration methods does Tallyfy offer for different technical needs?

### 1. How does Open API Integration enable custom development?

The Tallyfy REST API lets developers build custom integrations with complete control. With the API, you can:

- Build custom applications that use Tallyfy workflow data and functionality
- Exchange information bidirectionally between Tallyfy and external systems
- Automate process management - launch, update, and monitor workflows programmatically
- Manage user accounts, permissions, and organizational settings through code
- Control all Tallyfy features through custom applications and scripts

The API provides maximum customization for organizations with development resources.

### 2. How do Webhooks enable real-time event notifications?

Webhooks automatically send real-time notifications from Tallyfy to external systems when specific events occur - like task completions or process launches. With webhooks, you can:

- Receive instant notifications in external tools when tasks complete
- Track process progress in other business systems
- Automatically send form data from Tallyfy to downstream applications
- Trigger actions in external systems based on Tallyfy events
- Configure event filtering at template and step levels for targeted notifications

Webhooks create reactive automation - external systems respond immediately to Tallyfy events.

### 3. How do Middleware Platforms enable no-code integration?

Middleware platforms like Zapier, Make, and Power Automate connect Tallyfy to thousands of business applications through visual, drag-and-drop interfaces. These platforms let you:

- Use pre-built connections for popular applications without writing code
- Create integrations using visual workflow builders
- Transform data formats between different systems automatically
- Build conditional logic (IF-THEN statements) for intelligent workflows
- Rely on platform-managed updates and maintenance

Middleware platforms make integration accessible to non-technical users.

**Examples:** Zapier, Microsoft Power Automate, Make.com, Workato, Tray.io

:::note[Choosing a Middleware Tool]
Zapier is popular for simple links, but for more complex or higher-volume connections, tools like **Make.com** or **Microsoft Power Automate** are often more powerful and better value.

If you have developers, using Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) directly gives the most control and flexibility.

### 4. How do Computer AI Agents automate legacy system interactions?

Computer AI Agents use artificial intelligence to interact with computer interfaces like human users - interpreting screens, clicking buttons, and filling forms automatically. AI Agents are perfect for:

- Legacy systems without APIs or complex integration challenges
- Dynamic web pages and interfaces that change frequently
- Multi-step tasks requiring contextual understanding of screen content
- Adapting to interface changes without code modifications
- Systems where traditional API integration isn't feasible or cost-effective

AI Agents bridge the gap between modern workflow automation and legacy system limitations.

**Examples:** Claude Computer Use, Twin.so, Skyvern, Manus AI

:::note[Starting with Computer AI Agents]
Computer AI Agents work best for **short, bite-sized tasks** that are mundane and repetitive. Don't start with complex, goal-driven jobs as they can be expensive and unpredictable. Focus on simple data entry, form filling, or information extraction from legacy systems first.

### 10. Open source resources for developers

Tallyfy provides code examples and tools on [GitHub](https://github.com/tallyfy/api-support) to help developers build integrations:

- Sample code for common integration tasks
- Helper scripts and utilities
- Technical implementation guides
- Examples you can adapt for custom solutions

### 11. Idempotency handling for reliable integrations

When building integrations with [Tallyfy's API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) or [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/), you must handle duplicate events properly. Here's why:

- Webhooks can fire multiple times for the same event (task completed, reopened, then completed again)
- External systems might send duplicate API requests
- Process-level webhooks generate many events requiring careful handling
- Without idempotency, you risk duplicate records, incorrect data, or failed operations

Learn [how to handle idempotency](/products/pro/integrations/handling-idempotency-in-webhooks-and-api/) to build reliable integrations.

:::note[Future Exploration: Interactive Email Actions]
Tallyfy is also exploring future enhancements like [interactive email actions](/products/pro/integrations/interactive-email-actions/), which could allow users to complete certain tasks directly from within supported email clients like Outlook and Gmail.
