## On-Behalf-Of API Access

This feature helps any organization integrate Tallyfy into its own application or web app. By allowing them to provision their users internally into Tallyfy - they can also make requests to Tallyfy _on behalf of_ their users, without the need for their users to interact with Tallyfy directly.

## First steps - contact us 

The first and most important step to enable this functionality is to contact us and request a _Client Credentials_ grant key and secret.

This feature is available to paid/upgraded organizations, but not to free trials.

Once we've done the provisining on our end - we will get back to you with details.

## Generate the application access token and make special requests

Important - if you make API calls directly to the Tallyfy API endpoint, you must supply an additional header in your requests `X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient` otherwise your requests will be dropped.

#### 1. Use this endpoint request to get an application access token:

**POST: `https://account.tallyfy.com/oauth/token`** 

```json

{
    "client_id": 1111,
    "client_secret": "hTWzy5rpY...",
    "grant_type": "client_credentials",
    "scope": "*"
}
```

#### 2. Provision or add a new user to your organization

**POST: `https://go.tallyfy.com/api/applications/{orgID}/users`**

```json
{
    "first_name": "Red",
    "last_name": "Blue",
    "email": "red.blue@myorganization.com",
    "role": "standard", // "admin", "light"
    "timezone": "CST" // not required
}
```

#### 3. Generate an access token for a user from your organization

- **POST: `https://go.tallyfy.com/api/applications/{orgID}/users/{email}/token`**

* The user email must belong to your organization.
* A successful response will contain the **access token** of that user, which your application can use to do requests **on behalf of** that user.
