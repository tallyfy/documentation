## How third-party apps access Tallyfy's API

Your application can make Tallyfy API calls on behalf of users through the OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow[^1]. You'll get an app-level token first, then exchange it for user-specific tokens that let you act as individual users.

### When to use this pattern

- Embed Tallyfy workflow features inside your own software
- Automate user provisioning for clients or employees
- Run process management actions without users logging into Tallyfy directly

### What you'll need

- A paid Tallyfy Pro or Enterprise subscription
- Client credentials (client ID and secret) from Tallyfy Support
- Familiarity with OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow

:::caution[Paid feature]
Client credentials access is only available to paid organizations - not during free trials. Contact Tallyfy Support to get set up.
:::

## OAuth client credentials flow

Here's the full authentication flow for third-party applications.

```d2
direction: right

App: "Third-Party\nApplication" {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#f5f5f5"
}

Auth: "Tallyfy Auth\n(account.tallyfy.com)" {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#e6f3ff"
}

API: "Tallyfy API\n(go.tallyfy.com)" {
  shape: cylinder
  style.fill: "#ffe6e6"
}

User: "End User" {
  shape: person
  style.fill: "#e6ffe6"
}

App -> Auth: "1. Request app token\n(client credentials)" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
}

Auth -> App: "2. Return app\naccess token" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
}

App -> API: "3. Provision user\n(with app token)" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
}

API -> App: "4. User created\nresponse" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
}

App -> API: "5. Request user token\n(with app token)" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
}

API -> App: "6. Return user\naccess token" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
}

User -> App: "7. User action\nrequest" {
  style.stroke: "#666"
  style.stroke-dash: 3
}

App -> API: "8. API call on behalf\nof user (user token)" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
}

API -> App: "9. API response" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
}

App -> User: "10. Return result\nto user" {
  style.stroke: "#666"
  style.stroke-dash: 3
}
```

**What to notice:**
- Your app authenticates itself first to get an app-level token
- Both user provisioning and user token generation need that app-level token - this creates a chain of trust
- App tokens manage users. User tokens perform workflow actions. They're distinct on purpose.

#### Step 1 - Get client credentials

<Steps>
1. Contact Tallyfy Support and describe your integration use case
2. Tallyfy provisions a client ID and secret tied to your organization
3. Store these credentials securely (environment variables, secrets manager, etc.)
</Steps>

#### Step 2 - Get an application access token

Send a POST request to get your app-level token.

```
POST https://account.tallyfy.com/oauth/token
```

**Request body (form-encoded):**
```
grant_type=client_credentials
client_id=12345
client_secret=hTWzy5rpYXcBn8K4J9PqEs2V...
scope=*
```

**Headers:**
```
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
```

**Response:**
```json
{
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 604800,
    "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
}
```

:::note[Token expiration]
App tokens last 7 days (604,800 seconds). Request a fresh token before the current one expires - there's no separate refresh endpoint.
:::

#### Step 3 - Provision users

Create users in your Tallyfy organization using the app token.

```
POST https://go.tallyfy.com/api/applications/{orgID}/users
```

**Headers:**
```
Authorization: Bearer {your_app_access_token}
Content-Type: application/json
X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient
```

**Request body:**
```json
{
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Smith",
    "email": "john.smith@yourcompany.com",
    "role": "standard",
    "timezone": "America/Chicago"
}
```

**Available roles:**
- `admin` - full organization administration access
- `standard` - can create and manage processes
- `light` - can only complete assigned tasks

Both `first_name` and `last_name` are required (max 32 characters each). The `role` and `timezone` fields are optional.

**Response:**
```json
{
    "data": {
        "id": 12345,
        "email": "john.smith@yourcompany.com",
        "first_name": "John",
        "last_name": "Smith",
        "role": "standard",
        "created_at": "2024-01-15T14:22:10.000Z"
    }
}
```

#### Step 4 - Generate user-specific tokens

To act as a specific user, request a token for their email address.

```
POST https://go.tallyfy.com/api/applications/{orgID}/users/{email}/token
```

**Headers:**
```
Authorization: Bearer {your_app_access_token}
Content-Type: application/json
X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient
```

No request body needed - the email goes in the URL path. The user must already exist in your organization.

**Response:**
```json
{
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 7776000,
    "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
}
```

:::note[User token validity]
User tokens last 3 months (7,776,000 seconds). Build your refresh logic around this timeline.
:::

#### Step 5 - Make API calls as that user

Use the user-specific token for any Tallyfy API call. It works exactly as if the user made the request themselves.

```
GET https://go.tallyfy.com/api/organizations/{orgID}/me/tasks
```

**Headers:**
```
Authorization: Bearer {user_specific_access_token}
Content-Type: application/json
X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient
```

:::caution[Required header]
Always include `X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient` in every API call. Requests without it may not work correctly.
:::

### Security tips

- Keep client credentials in encrypted storage or a secrets manager
- Control which parts of your app can access user tokens
- Confirm user emails belong to your organization before requesting tokens
- Handle token expiration gracefully - refresh before they expire, not after

### Troubleshooting

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| 401 Unauthorized | Bad client credentials | Double-check your client ID and secret |
| 403 Forbidden | Token doesn't match the organization | Verify the client is linked to the correct org |
| 404 Not Found | User doesn't exist | Check the email and organization ID |
| 422 Unprocessable | User not in your org | The email exists but isn't part of your organization |
| 429 Too Many Requests | Rate limit hit | Add request throttling and retry logic |

Contact Tallyfy Support if you're stuck - include your error messages and the endpoint you're calling.
