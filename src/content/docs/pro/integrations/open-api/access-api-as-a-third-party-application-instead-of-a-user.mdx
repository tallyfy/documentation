## Third-Party Application Integration with Tallyfy API

This guide explains how to integrate your application with Tallyfy using the client credentials flow, allowing your application to make API requests on behalf of your users without requiring them to directly interact with Tallyfy.

### Use Cases for On-Behalf-Of Access

This integration pattern is ideal for organizations that want to:

- Embed Tallyfy functionality within their own software
- Provide seamless workflow capabilities to their users
- Automate process management for clients or employees
- Maintain a consistent user experience in their application
- Handle user provisioning programmatically

## Implementation Overview

### Prerequisites

- Paid Tallyfy Professional or Enterprise subscription
- Client credentials (client ID and secret) from Tallyfy
- Basic understanding of OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow
- Development environment for testing API integration

:::caution[Enterprise Feature]
The client credentials grant type is only available to paid organizations and is not accessible during free trials. Contact Tallyfy Support to request access to this feature.
:::

### Step 1: Request Client Credentials

1. Contact Tallyfy Support to request client credentials for your organization
2. Provide details about your integration use case and requirements
3. Tallyfy will provision a client ID and secret specific to your organization
4. Store these credentials securely in your application environment

### Step 2: Obtain Application Access Token

To authenticate your application with Tallyfy, you must first obtain an application-level access token:

```
POST https://account.tallyfy.com/oauth/token
```

**Request Body:**
```json
{
    "client_id": 12345,
    "client_secret": "hTWzy5rpYXcBn8K4J9PqEs2V...",
    "grant_type": "client_credentials",
    "scope": "*"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
}
```

:::note[Token Expiration]
Application access tokens typically expire after one hour. Your application should implement token refresh logic or request new tokens as needed.
:::

### Step 3: Provision Users Programmatically

With your application access token, you can create and manage users in your Tallyfy organization:

```
POST https://go.tallyfy.com/api/applications/{orgID}/users
```

**Headers:**
```
Authorization: Bearer {your_app_access_token}
Content-Type: application/json
X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient
```

**Request Body:**
```json
{
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Smith",
    "email": "john.smith@yourcompany.com",
    "role": "standard",
    "timezone": "America/Chicago"
}
```

**Available Roles:**
- `admin` - Full organization administration access
- `standard` - Regular user with process creation capabilities
- `light` - Limited user who can only complete assigned tasks

**Response:**
```json
{
    "id": 12345,
    "email": "john.smith@yourcompany.com",
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Smith",
    "role": "standard",
    "created_at": "2023-05-15T14:22:10.000Z"
}
```

### Step 4: Generate User-Specific Access Tokens

To perform actions on behalf of a specific user, you need to obtain a user-specific token:

```
POST https://go.tallyfy.com/api/applications/{orgID}/users/{email}/token
```

**Headers:**
```
Authorization: Bearer {your_app_access_token}
Content-Type: application/json
X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient
```

**Response:**
```json
{
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
}
```

### Step 5: Make API Requests on Behalf of Users

Use the user-specific token to make API requests as if they were made by the user:

```
GET https://go.tallyfy.com/api/organizations/{orgID}/me/tasks
```

**Headers:**
```
Authorization: Bearer {user_specific_access_token}
Content-Type: application/json
X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient
```

:::caution[Required Header]
Always include the `X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient` header in all direct API calls to Tallyfy endpoints. Requests without this header will be rejected.
:::

## Security Considerations

When implementing on-behalf-of API access:

- Store client credentials in secure, encrypted storage
- Implement proper access controls to user tokens
- Rotate secrets periodically according to your security policies
- Validate that user emails belong to your organization before requesting tokens
- Use HTTPS for all API communication
- Implement token expiration handling and refresh logic

## Troubleshooting

| Error | Description | Solution |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| 401 Unauthorized | Invalid client credentials | Verify client ID and secret |
| 403 Forbidden | Insufficient permissions | Ensure the client has appropriate scopes |
| 404 Not Found | User not found | Verify the user email and organization ID |
| 429 Too Many Requests | Rate limit exceeded | Implement request throttling and retries |
