Tallyfy's REST API works with any HTTP client. Here's how to get started with popular API testing tools.

## Available client guides

- **[Postman](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/api-clients/postman/)** - Visual interface for testing Tallyfy API endpoints without writing code

## Why use an API client?

API clients let you:
- Test Tallyfy endpoints without writing code
- Explore the API interactively
- Generate code snippets in your preferred language
- Share request collections with your team
- Debug authentication and request issues

The Postman guide covers Tallyfy-specific authentication setup, common operations, and real request examples you can run immediately.
