Set up authentication with your Tallyfy credentials in Postman, then start testing endpoints for templates, processes, and tasks. No code required.

## Why use Postman with Tallyfy?

Postman lets you test Tallyfy's API without writing code. You can:
- Launch processes from templates
- Complete tasks and update statuses
- Export workflow data
- Test integrations before building them

Think of it as a playground for Tallyfy's API - you'll figure out what's possible before committing to code.

## Prerequisites

You'll need:
- A Tallyfy account with API access
- Postman desktop or web app (free at [postman.com](https://www.postman.com)<a href="https://www.postman.com" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>[1]</sup></a>)
- Your API credentials from **Settings > Integrations > REST API** in Tallyfy

## Quick setup

<Steps>
1. **Get your credentials from Tallyfy**

   Go to **Settings > Integrations > REST API** and copy your:
   - Client ID
   - Client Secret
   - Organization ID
   - Your Tallyfy login email and password

2. **Create a Postman environment**

   In Postman, click **Environments** > **Create Environment**. Add these variables:
   ```
   TALLYFY_CLIENT_ID = [your client id]
   TALLYFY_CLIENT_SECRET = [your client secret]
   TALLYFY_ORG_ID = [your organization id]
   TALLYFY_USERNAME = your@email.com
   TALLYFY_PASSWORD = [your password]
   TALLYFY_BASE_URL = https://go.tallyfy.com/api
   ```

3. **Set up authentication**

   Tallyfy uses the `password` grant type - most endpoints need user context. Create a new request:
   - Method: `POST`
   - URL: `{{TALLYFY_BASE_URL}}/oauth/token`
   - Body (x-www-form-urlencoded):
     ```
     grant_type = password
     username = {{TALLYFY_USERNAME}}
     password = {{TALLYFY_PASSWORD}}
     client_id = {{TALLYFY_CLIENT_ID}}
     client_secret = {{TALLYFY_CLIENT_SECRET}}
     ```

4. **Test your first API call**

   After getting your access token, try listing templates. Every request needs these headers:
   - `Authorization: Bearer [your access token]`
   - `X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient`
   - `Accept: application/json`

   Then send:
   - Method: `GET`
   - URL: `{{TALLYFY_BASE_URL}}/organizations/{{TALLYFY_ORG_ID}}/checklists`
</Steps>

> **Important** - The API uses different names than the Tallyfy UI. Templates are called `checklists` and processes are called `runs` in API endpoints.

## Common Tallyfy API operations

Here are the most-used endpoints. All paths sit under `/organizations/{{TALLYFY_ORG_ID}}`.

### Launch a process from a template
```
POST /organizations/{{TALLYFY_ORG_ID}}/runs
Body: { "checklist_id": "{{TEMPLATE_ID}}", "name": "My Process" }
```

### Complete a task
```
POST /organizations/{{TALLYFY_ORG_ID}}/runs/{{RUN_ID}}/completed-tasks
Body: { "task_id": "{{TASK_ID}}" }
```

### List active processes
```
GET /organizations/{{TALLYFY_ORG_ID}}/runs?status=active
```

### Upload a file
```
POST /organizations/{{TALLYFY_ORG_ID}}/upload
```
