import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

To test Tallyfy's API with Postman, set up authentication with your API credentials, then import our collection to explore endpoints for templates, processes, and tasks. This guide walks you through complete setup and provides real examples.

## What is Postman and why use it with Tallyfy?

Postman helps you test API endpoints without writing code. For Tallyfy, this means you can quickly:
- Launch processes programmatically
- Update task statuses in bulk
- Export workflow data
- Test integrations before building them

Think of Postman as your Tallyfy API playground - perfect for exploring what's possible before committing to code.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, you need:
- A Tallyfy account with API access enabled
- Postman desktop app or web version (free at [postman.com](https://www.postman.com)<a href="https://www.postman.com" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>[1]</sup></a>)
- Your Tallyfy API credentials (found in Settings > API)

## Quick setup

<Steps>
1. **Get your Tallyfy API credentials**
   
   Navigate to **Settings > API** in Tallyfy and copy your:
   - Client ID
   - Client Secret
   - Organization ID

2. **Create a Postman environment**
   
   In Postman, click **Environments** > **Create Environment**. Add these variables:
   ```
   TALLYFY_CLIENT_ID = [your client id]
   TALLYFY_CLIENT_SECRET = [your client secret]
   TALLYFY_ORG_ID = [your organization id]
   TALLYFY_BASE_URL = https://go.tallyfy.com/api
   ```

3. **Set up authentication**
   
   Create a new request in Postman:
   - Method: `POST`
   - URL: `{{TALLYFY_BASE_URL}}/oauth/token`
   - Body (x-www-form-urlencoded):
     ```
     grant_type = client_credentials
     client_id = {{TALLYFY_CLIENT_ID}}
     client_secret = {{TALLYFY_CLIENT_SECRET}}
     ```

4. **Test your first API call**
   
   After getting your access token, try listing templates:
   - Method: `GET`
   - URL: `{{TALLYFY_BASE_URL}}/organizations/{{TALLYFY_ORG_ID}}/templates`
   - Authorization: Bearer Token (paste your access token)
</Steps>

## Common Tallyfy API operations

Here are the most useful endpoints for workflow automation:

### Launch a process from template
```
POST /organizations/{{TALLYFY_ORG_ID}}/templates/{{TEMPLATE_ID}}/launch
```

### Complete a task
```
PUT /tasks/{{TASK_ID}}/complete
```

### List all active processes
```
GET /organizations/{{TALLYFY_ORG_ID}}/processes?status=active
```

### Upload file to task
```
POST /tasks/{{TASK_ID}}/files
```
