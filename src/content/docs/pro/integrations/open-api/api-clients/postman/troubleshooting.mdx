To fix Postman errors with Tallyfy's API, check the `X-Tallyfy-Client` header first, verify your authentication grant type is `password` (not `client_credentials`), and make sure tokens haven't expired. These three issues cause most Tallyfy API failures.

## Authentication errors

### 401 Unauthorized

Here are the most common causes, in order of likelihood:

1. **Missing X-Tallyfy-Client header**
   ```
   X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient
   ```
   Every request needs this header. It's how Tallyfy identifies the client type making API calls.

2. **Wrong grant type**
   - You used: `grant_type=client_credentials`
   - You need: `grant_type=password`
   - Client credentials grant is only for system-level app operations (tokens last 7 days). For user-context work, always use the password grant.

3. **Expired token**
   - Access tokens from the password grant last **6 months** (not 1 hour)
   - Refresh tokens last **12 months**
   - Client credentials tokens last **7 days**
   - If you're unsure, just re-authenticate and get a fresh token

4. **Bearer token format**
   ```
   // Wrong formats:
   Authorization: Bearer[token]       // no space
   Authorization: Bearer  [token]     // double space
   Authorization: [token]             // missing Bearer

   // Correct (exactly one space):
   Authorization: Bearer [token]
   ```

### 400 Bad request on /oauth/token

The token endpoint requires URL-encoded form data, not JSON:

**Wrong content type**:
```
// You have:
Content-Type: application/json

// You need:
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
```

**Wrong body format**:
```javascript
// Wrong - JSON body:
{
    "grant_type": "password",
    "username": "user@example.com"
}

// Right - URL-encoded:
grant_type=password&username=user@example.com&password=...&client_id=...&client_secret=...
```

### Invalid client errors

**"Invalid client" or "Client authentication failed"** means:

1. **Non-numeric client_id** - The API validates that `client_id` is numeric. If it's not, you'll get a 401 with `{"error": "invalid_client"}`.
2. **Credentials don't match** - Client ID and Secret must be from the same app registration, and the Organization ID must match.
3. **Special characters in secrets** - If a secret contains `+`, `/`, or `=`, make sure they're properly URL-encoded when sent as form data.

## Data and request errors

### 404 Not found

The API returns two different 404 messages depending on the cause:

- **Wrong URL path** returns: `{"error": true, "message": "API endpoint not found", "code": "ENDPOINT_NOT_FOUND"}`
- **Missing resource** returns: `{"error": true, "message": "Resource not found", "code": "RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND"}`

**Common path mistakes**:
```javascript
// Wrong: /organization/  (singular)
// Right: /organizations/ (plural)

// Wrong: /templates/     (doesn't exist)
// Right: /checklists/    (the actual endpoint)

// Wrong: /processes/     (doesn't exist)
// Right: /runs/          (the actual endpoint)

// Wrong: /members/       (doesn't exist)
// Right: /users/         (the actual endpoint)
```

**Wrong Organization ID** - Make sure you're using the org ID, not a user ID. Log what you're sending:
```javascript
console.log("Org ID:", pm.environment.get("TALLYFY_ORG_ID"));
console.log("Full URL:", pm.request.url.toString());
```

### 422 Unprocessable entity

This means validation failed. The API returns errors in this format:
```json
{
    "error": true,
    "errors": {
        "field_name": ["The field_name is required."]
    }
}
```

**Common causes**:
- Missing required fields (e.g., `name` when launching a process)
- Wrong data types (sending `"100"` as a string instead of `100` as a number)
- Invalid date format (use `YYYY-MM-DD`)
- Invalid enum values for select/radio fields

### 403 Forbidden

This typically means the authenticated user or client app doesn't have permission for the requested resource. For client credentials specifically, the API checks that the token's client app belongs to the same organization as the one in the URL - if not, you'll get `"You don't have application's permissions for this organization!"`.

## Rate limiting

### 429 Too many requests

Tallyfy's API rate limit is **600 requests per minute** per authenticated user (or per IP for unauthenticated requests). This resets on a rolling 1-minute window, not on the hour.

Trial accounts have additional rate limits on specific operations (like password updates: 3 per day).

When rate limited, the API returns:
```json
{
    "message": "You've reached the limit for [operation]. Please try again later.",
    "code": "RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED"
}
```

The response includes `Retry-After` and `X-RateLimit-Remaining` headers.

**Simple backoff approach**:
```javascript
// If you get a 429, wait for the Retry-After header value
if (pm.response.code === 429) {
    const retryAfter = pm.response.headers.get("Retry-After");
    console.log(`Rate limited. Wait ${retryAfter} seconds before retrying.`);
}
```

**Spacing out batch requests**:
```javascript
// Add a delay between requests to stay under limits
async function processItemsWithDelay(items, delayMs = 150) {
    for (const item of items) {
        await pm.sendRequest({...});
        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, delayMs));
    }
}
```

## File upload issues

### Files not uploading

**Wrong body type** - file uploads must use `form-data`, not raw JSON:
```
Body: form-data
  - name: [File type, select your file]
  - uploaded_from: [Text, e.g., "ko_field" or a form field ID]
  - subject_type: [Text, "Template" or "Process"]
  - subject_id: [Text, the template or process ID]
```

**File too large** - Tallyfy's upload limit is **100MB**.

**Don't set Content-Type manually** - When using form-data in Postman, let Postman set the `Content-Type` header automatically (it needs to include the boundary string). Manually setting `Content-Type: multipart/form-data` breaks the upload.

## Debugging helpers

### Pre-request debug script

Add this to your collection's Pre-request Script to catch issues before they happen:

```javascript
// Check required headers
const headers = pm.request.headers.toObject();

if (!headers['Authorization']) {
    console.error("MISSING: Authorization header");
}
if (!headers['X-Tallyfy-Client']) {
    console.error("MISSING: X-Tallyfy-Client header");
}

// Check required environment variables
['TALLYFY_ORG_ID', 'TALLYFY_ACCESS_TOKEN', 'TALLYFY_BASE_URL'].forEach(key => {
    if (!pm.environment.get(key)) {
        console.error(`MISSING env var: ${key}`);
    }
});

console.log(`Request: ${pm.request.method} ${pm.request.url.toString()}`);
```

### Response analysis script

Add this to your Tests tab for automatic error diagnosis:

```javascript
const statusCode = pm.response.code;

if (statusCode >= 400) {
    console.error(`Error ${statusCode}: ${pm.response.status}`);

    try {
        const body = pm.response.json();

        if (body.message) {
            console.error(`Message: ${body.message}`);
        }
        if (body.errors) {
            console.error("Validation errors:");
            Object.entries(body.errors).forEach(([field, msgs]) => {
                console.error(`  ${field}: ${Array.isArray(msgs) ? msgs.join(', ') : msgs}`);
            });
        }
    } catch (e) {
        console.error("Response body:", pm.response.text());
    }
}

// Log rate limit status
const remaining = pm.response.headers.get("X-RateLimit-Remaining");
if (remaining !== null) {
    console.log(`Rate limit remaining: ${remaining}`);
}
```

## Getting help

### Before contacting support

1. Open the Postman Console (View > Show Postman Console) and check the full request/response details
2. Verify all three required headers are present: `Authorization`, `X-Tallyfy-Client`, and `Accept`
3. Confirm your org ID and token are valid
4. Check the response body for specific error messages and codes

**Include these details in any support request**:
- Exact error message and HTTP status code
- Full request URL (with method)
- Response body
- Your organization ID
- Timestamp of the attempt
