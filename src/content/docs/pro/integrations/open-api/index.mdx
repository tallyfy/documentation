## Tallyfy REST API Integration

The Tallyfy REST API provides developers with programmatic access to platform functionality. Tallyfy is built with an **API-first design**, meaning the user interface itself utilizes the same public API available to you. This ensures the API is well-maintained and covers core platform features.

This enables you to build custom integrations, automate workflows, and extend Tallyfy's capabilities to meet your organization's specific needs.

Tallyfy provides multiple integration approaches to connect your workflow processes with other business systems. Each method offers different capabilities, complexity levels, and technical requirements to suit various organizational needs.

### API overview

| Endpoint | Base URL | Documentation |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| Production | `https://go.tallyfy.com/api/` | [API Reference](https://go.tallyfy.com/api/) |

### Authentication methods

Tallyfy supports three authentication approaches:

1. **User-based Authentication**
   - Obtain a user token via the API or web interface
   - Used for integrations acting on behalf of specific users
   - Subject to user permissions and restrictions

2. **Application Authentication** (Enterprise Feature)
   - Client credentials grant for server-to-server integrations
   - Ability to act on behalf of multiple users
   - Ideal for embedded applications and ISVs

3. **OAuth Authorization Flow** (Enterprise Feature)
   - Standard OAuth flow where users authenticate directly with Tallyfy
   - Redirect-based flow that returns access tokens to your application
   - Recommended method for third-party integrations
   - [Learn more about OAuth Authorization Flow](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/oauth-authorization-flow/)

### Required request headers

All API requests must include these headers:

```
Authorization: Bearer {your_access_token}
Content-Type: application/json
X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient
```

:::caution[Header Requirement]
The `X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient` header is mandatory for all direct API calls. Requests without this header will be automatically rejected.
:::

### Core API capabilities

The API provides access to all major Tallyfy functionalities:

| Category | Capabilities |
|----------|--------------|
| **Process Management** | Launch processes, retrieve status, cancel runs |
| **Task Operations** | Complete tasks, update form fields, add comments |
| **User Administration** | Create users, manage permissions, assign roles |
| **Template Management** | Create/update templates, manage steps, set permissions |
| **Data Access** | Export process data, generate reports, access analytics |
| **File Operations** | Upload files, attach documents, manage storage |

### Response format

All API responses:
- Use JSON format
- Include HTTP status codes indicating success/failure
- Provide detailed error messages for troubleshooting
- Support pagination for collection endpoints

### Rate limiting

API requests are subject to the following limits:

- 100 requests per minute per organization
- 1,000 requests per hour per organization
- Responses include rate limit headers showing usage and reset times

### Getting started

To begin using the Tallyfy API:

1. Obtain API credentials from **Settings** > **Integrations** > **REST API**
2. Review the [API documentation](https://go.tallyfy.com/api/) for endpoint details
3. Check [GitHub examples](https://github.com/tallyfy/api-support/) for code samples

:::note[Testing the API]
While Tallyfy does not provide an interactive API explorer, you can use standard tools like Postman, Insomnia, or `curl` commands to send requests to the API endpoints and test your integrations. Refer to the API documentation for request formats and expected responses.
