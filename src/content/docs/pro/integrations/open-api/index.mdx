## Tallyfy REST API overview

The Tallyfy REST API lets developers build custom connections to our core platform features through code-based integrations.

Tallyfy's "API-first" approach means our public API gives you the exact same functionality that powers our web app - no second-class citizen treatment here. Everything we built for ourselves, you get too. This foundation guarantees stable APIs for your mission-critical integrations (because we depend on them just as much as you do).

### Use cases for API integration

API integration lets you embed Tallyfy functionality right into your existing business apps, automate complex workflows across multiple systems, and create completely customized user experiences. Instead of forcing people to context-switch between different systems, the API brings Tallyfy's capabilities into the tools your team already uses.

### API capabilities

The API lets you build custom connections, automate workflows between Tallyfy and external systems, and extend platform functionality.

### API fundamentals

| Environment | Base URL                  | Documentation Link                     |
|-------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Production  | `https://go.tallyfy.com/api/` | [Tallyfy API Reference](https://go.tallyfy.com/api/) |

### Authentication methods

Tallyfy provides three secure authentication methods for programmatic API access:

1. **User Token Authentication**: Get a token for specific Tallyfy users (from their profile or through our API). Your app works with that user's exact permissions and access.
   - **Note**: Personal access tokens are invalidated when users log out. For stable, long-running automations, consider application tokens instead.
2. **Application Token Authentication**: Get app-level credentials (client ID & secret) so your application can act on behalf of multiple users. Perfect for server-to-server connections or multi-user apps.
3. **OAuth Authentication Flow**: The industry-standard secure way that lets users give your app access to their Tallyfy data without sharing passwords. Recommended for third-party apps. [Learn more](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/oauth-authorization-flow/).

### Required headers

Every API request must include these mandatory headers:

```
Authorization: Bearer {your_access_token}  // Your user or app token
Content-Type: application/json           // Tells Tallyfy you're sending JSON data
X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient            // **Required** - Identifies the request source
```

:::caution[X-Tallyfy-Client Header is Mandatory!]
Your code *must* include the `X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient` header. Requests without it will fail with a 401.
:::

### Available API operations

The API provides comprehensive access to core Tallyfy features, including:

| Functional Category   | Available API Operations                                |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Process Management**| Launch processes, monitor status, cancel executions    |
| **Task Operations**   | Complete tasks, update form data, manage comments      |
| **User Administration**| Create/manage users, configure roles & permissions    |
| **Template Control**  | Create/update templates, manage steps & configurations |
| **Data Access**       | Export process data, retrieve analytics information    |
| **File Management**   | Upload files, manage attachments and documents         |

### API response format

Tallyfy API responses follow standard conventions:
- All data returns in structured JSON format for easy parsing.
- Standard HTTP status codes indicate request outcomes (200 for success, 4xx/5xx for errors).
- Error responses include detailed, actionable error messages.
- List endpoints support pagination for efficient data retrieval.

### Rate limits

Tallyfy enforces these rate limits:

- **Per-minute limit**: Maximum 100 requests per minute (per organization)
- **Per-hour limit**: Maximum 1,000 requests per hour (per organization)
- **Rate limit monitoring**: API response headers indicate current usage and remaining capacity

If you're hitting these limits regularly, implement caching or batching. Contact support for high-volume use cases.

### Getting started

1. **Get your API credentials**: Find your API keys/tokens at **Settings** > **Integrations** > **REST API** in Tallyfy.
2. **Check out our documentation**: Read through the official [API docs](https://go.tallyfy.com/api/) for detailed info on endpoints and how to use them.
3. **Look at code examples**: Check out practical examples on [Tallyfy's GitHub repo](https://github.com/tallyfy/api-support/) for different programming languages.

:::note[Testing API Calls]
Use standard developer tools like Postman, Insomnia, or command-line `curl` to test API requests.

## Recommended next

After understanding the API basics, we recommend these next steps:

- Learn how to [integrate with Tallyfy using the API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/how-to-integrate-with-tallyfy-using-api/) for detailed authentication and request examples.
- If you're building a multi-user application, explore [API usage as a third-party application](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/access-api-as-a-third-party-application-instead-of-a-user/) to understand client credentials flow.
- Check the [API code samples](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/code-samples/) for practical examples in various programming languages.
