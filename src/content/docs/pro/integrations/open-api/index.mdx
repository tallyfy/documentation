## How can I integrate with the Tallyfy REST API?

The Tallyfy REST API lets developers build custom connections to our core platform features through code-based integrations and smart automation.

Tallyfy's "API-first" approach means our public API gives you the same functionality that powers our web app - so you get thoroughly tested, reliable access to everything. This foundation guarantees stable APIs for your mission-critical integrations.

### Why is the Tallyfy API valuable for custom integrations?

The Tallyfy API becomes essential when you need custom workflow solutions that go beyond our standard interface.

API integration lets you embed Tallyfy functionality right into your existing business apps, automate complex workflows across multiple systems, and create completely customized user experiences. Instead of forcing people to switch between different systems, the API brings Tallyfy's capabilities into the tools your team already uses every day.

This smart integration approach seriously improves user adoption, boosts productivity, and keeps your data consistent across all your systems.

### What capabilities does the Tallyfy API provide?

The API lets you build custom connections, automate complex workflows between Tallyfy and external systems, and extend Tallyfy way beyond what our standard platform offers.

### What are the Tallyfy API fundamentals?

| Environment | Base URL                  | Documentation Link                     |
|-------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Production  | `https://go.tallyfy.com/api/` | [Tallyfy API Reference](https://go.tallyfy.com/api/) |

### How can I authenticate with the Tallyfy API?

Tallyfy provides three secure authentication methods for programmatic API access:

1. **User Token Authentication**: Get a token for specific Tallyfy users (from their profile or through our API). Your app works with that user's exact permissions and access.
2. **Application Token Authentication** (Enterprise Plans): Get app-level credentials (client ID & secret) so your application can act on behalf of multiple users. Perfect for server-to-server connections or multi-user apps.
3. **OAuth Authentication Flow** (Enterprise Plans): The industry-standard secure way that lets users give your app access to their Tallyfy data without sharing passwords. We recommend this for third-party apps. [Learn more](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/oauth-authorization-flow/).

### What headers are required for Tallyfy API requests?

Every API request must include these mandatory headers:

```
Authorization: Bearer {your_access_token}  // Your user or app token
Content-Type: application/json           // Tells Tallyfy you're sending JSON data
X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient            // **Required** - Identifies the request source
```

:::caution[X-Tallyfy-Client Header is Mandatory!]
Your code *must* include the `X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient` header. Requests without it will fail.
:::

### What functionality can I access through the Tallyfy API?

The API provides comprehensive access to core Tallyfy features, including:

| Functional Category   | Available API Operations                                |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Process Management**| Launch processes, monitor status, cancel executions    |
| **Task Operations**   | Complete tasks, update form data, manage comments      |
| **User Administration**| Create/manage users, configure roles & permissions    |
| **Template Control**  | Create/update templates, manage steps & configurations |
| **Data Access**       | Export process data, retrieve analytics information    |
| **File Management**   | Upload files, manage attachments and documents         |

### How does the Tallyfy API respond to requests?

Tallyfy API responses follow standard conventions:
- All data returns in structured JSON format for easy parsing.
- Standard HTTP status codes indicate request outcomes (200 for success, 4xx/5xx for errors).
- Error responses include detailed, actionable error messages.
- List endpoints support pagination for efficient data retrieval in manageable chunks.

### What are the Tallyfy API rate limits?

To keep our platform stable and fair for everyone, Tallyfy has these rate limits:

- **Per-minute limit**: Maximum 100 requests per minute (per organization)
- **Per-hour limit**: Maximum 1,000 requests per hour (per organization)
- **Rate limit monitoring**: API response headers indicate current usage and remaining capacity

### How can I get started with the Tallyfy API?

1. **Get your API credentials**: Find your API keys/tokens at **Settings** > **Integrations** > **REST API** in Tallyfy.
2. **Check out our documentation**: Read through the official [API docs](https://go.tallyfy.com/api/) for detailed info on endpoints and how to use them.
3. **Look at code examples**: Check out practical examples on [Tallyfy's GitHub repo](https://github.com/tallyfy/api-support/) for different programming languages.

:::note[Testing API Calls]
Tallyfy doesn't have a built-in API testing tool. Use standard developer tools like Postman, Insomnia, or command-line `curl` to experiment with API requests.
