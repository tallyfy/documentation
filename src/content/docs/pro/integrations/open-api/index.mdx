## Tallyfy REST API Integration

The Tallyfy REST API provides developers with programmatic access to all platform functionality. This enables you to build custom integrations, automate workflows, and extend Tallyfy's capabilities to meet your organization's specific needs.

### API Overview

| Endpoint | Base URL | Documentation |
|----------|----------|---------------|
| Production | `https://go.tallyfy.com/api/` | [API Reference](https://go.tallyfy.com/api/) |
| Interactive | `https://go.tallyfy.com/api/swagger-ui` | [OpenAPI Specification](https://go.tallyfy.com/api/swagger-ui) |

### Authentication Methods

Tallyfy supports two authentication approaches:

1. **User-based Authentication**
   - Obtain a user token via the API or web interface
   - Used for integrations acting on behalf of specific users
   - Subject to user permissions and restrictions

2. **Application Authentication** (Enterprise Feature)
   - Client credentials grant for server-to-server integrations
   - Ability to act on behalf of multiple users
   - Ideal for embedded applications and ISVs

### Required Request Headers

All API requests must include these headers:

```
Authorization: Bearer {your_access_token}
Content-Type: application/json
X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient
```

:::caution[Critical Header Requirement]
The `X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient` header is mandatory for all direct API calls. Requests without this header will be automatically rejected.
