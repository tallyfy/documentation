## How can I integrate with the Tallyfy REST API?

The Tallyfy REST API empowers developers to programmatically interact with core platform features through comprehensive code-based integration capabilities and sophisticated automation workflows.

Tallyfy's "API-first" architecture ensures the public API delivers the same functionality powering the web application, providing thoroughly tested, reliable access to comprehensive platform features. This architectural foundation guarantees API stability and feature completeness for mission-critical custom integrations.

### Why is the Tallyfy API valuable for custom integrations?

The Tallyfy API proves essential for organizations requiring sophisticated workflow solutions extending beyond standard interface capabilities and platform limitations.

API integration enables seamless embedding of Tallyfy functionality directly into existing business applications, automating complex multi-system workflows, and creating completely tailored user experiences. Rather than forcing disruptive context switching between systems, the API brings comprehensive Tallyfy capabilities into tools teams already use daily.

This strategic integration approach significantly improves user adoption rates, enhances operational productivity, and maintains critical data consistency across all organizational systems.

### What capabilities does the Tallyfy API provide?

The API enables building sophisticated custom connections, automating complex workflows between Tallyfy and external systems, and extending Tallyfy functionality far beyond standard platform features.

### What are the Tallyfy API fundamentals?

| Environment | Base URL                  | Documentation Link                     |
|-------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Production  | `https://go.tallyfy.com/api/` | [Tallyfy API Reference](https://go.tallyfy.com/api/) |

### How can I authenticate with the Tallyfy API?

Tallyfy provides three secure authentication methods for programmatic API access:

1. **User Token Authentication**: Obtain a token for specific Tallyfy users (from their profile or via API). Your application operates with that user's exact permissions and access levels.
2. **Application Token Authentication** (Enterprise Plans): Acquire application-level credentials (client ID & secret) enabling your application to act on behalf of multiple users. Ideal for server-to-server connections or multi-user applications.
3. **OAuth Authentication Flow** (Enterprise Plans): The industry-standard secure method allowing users to grant application access to their Tallyfy data without sharing passwords. Recommended for third-party applications. [Learn more](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/oauth-authorization-flow/).

### What headers are required for Tallyfy API requests?

Every API request must include these mandatory headers:

```
Authorization: Bearer {your_access_token}  // Your user or app token
Content-Type: application/json           // Tells Tallyfy you're sending JSON data
X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient            // **Required** - Identifies the request source
```

:::caution[X-Tallyfy-Client Header is Mandatory!]
Your code *must* include the `X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient` header. Requests without it will fail.
:::

### What functionality can I access through the Tallyfy API?

The API provides comprehensive access to core Tallyfy features, including:

| Functional Category   | Available API Operations                                |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Process Management**| Launch processes, monitor status, cancel executions    |
| **Task Operations**   | Complete tasks, update form data, manage comments      |
| **User Administration**| Create/manage users, configure roles & permissions    |
| **Template Control**  | Create/update templates, manage steps & configurations |
| **Data Access**       | Export process data, retrieve analytics information    |
| **File Management**   | Upload files, manage attachments and documents         |

### How does the Tallyfy API respond to requests?

Tallyfy API responses follow standard conventions:
- All data returns in structured JSON format for easy parsing.
- Standard HTTP status codes indicate request outcomes (200 for success, 4xx/5xx for errors).
- Error responses include detailed, actionable error messages.
- List endpoints support pagination for efficient data retrieval in manageable chunks.

### What are the Tallyfy API rate limits?

To ensure platform stability and fair usage, Tallyfy implements the following rate limits:

- **Per-minute limit**: Maximum 100 requests per minute (per organization)
- **Per-hour limit**: Maximum 1,000 requests per hour (per organization)
- **Rate limit monitoring**: API response headers indicate current usage and remaining capacity

### How can I get started with the Tallyfy API?

1. **Obtain API credentials**: Access your API keys/tokens from **Settings** > **Integrations** > **REST API** within Tallyfy.
2. **Review comprehensive documentation**: Study the official [API documentation](https://go.tallyfy.com/api/) for detailed endpoint specifications and usage patterns.
3. **Explore code examples**: Examine practical implementation examples on [Tallyfy's GitHub repository](https://github.com/tallyfy/api-support/) for various programming languages.

:::note[Testing API Calls]
Tallyfy doesn't have a built-in API testing tool. Use standard developer tools like Postman, Insomnia, or command-line `curl` to experiment with API requests.
