description: Tallyfy's REST API gives developers full programmatic access to every
  core platform feature—including process management and task operations and user
  control and data export—using standard JSON responses and three authentication methods
  (user tokens and application tokens and OAuth) with required headers sent to a single
  production endpoint.

## Tallyfy REST API overview

The Tallyfy REST API lets developers build custom integrations with core platform features through code.

Tallyfy's "API-first" approach means the public API gives you the same functionality that powers our web app. Everything we built for ourselves, you get too. We depend on these APIs just as much as you do - so they're stable and well-maintained. As an [independent platform committed to data portability](/products/pro/miscellaneous/about-tallyfy/), we ensure you always have full programmatic access to your workflows and data.

:::note[Technical audience]
This section is intended for developers or those working with development teams.

### API fundamentals

| Environment | Base URL                  | Documentation                     |
|-------------|---------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Production  | `https://go.tallyfy.com/api/` | [Tallyfy API reference](https://go.tallyfy.com/api/) |

### Authentication methods

Tallyfy provides three authentication methods for API access:

1. **User token authentication** - Get a token for a specific Tallyfy user (from their profile or through the API). Your app works with that user's exact permissions.
   - **Note**: Personal access tokens are invalidated when users log out. For long-running automations, use application tokens instead.
2. **Application token authentication** - Get app-level credentials (client ID and secret) so your application can act on behalf of multiple users. Ideal for server-to-server connections.
3. **OAuth authentication flow** - The industry-standard way to let users grant your app access to their Tallyfy data without sharing passwords. Recommended for third-party apps. [Learn more](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/oauth-authorization-flow/).

### Required headers

Every API request must include these headers:

```
Authorization: Bearer {your_access_token}
Accept: application/json
X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient
```

:::caution[X-Tallyfy-Client header is mandatory]
Your code *must* include `X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient`. Requests without it will fail - typically returning "endpoint not found" or a 401 error.

### Available API operations

The API provides access to core Tallyfy features:

| Category   | Operations                                |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Process management**| Launch processes, monitor status, cancel runs    |
| **Task operations**   | Complete tasks, update form data, manage comments      |
| **User management**| Create/manage users, configure roles and permissions    |
| **Template control**  | Create/update templates, manage steps and form fields |
| **Data export**       | Export process data, retrieve reporting information    |
| **File management**   | Upload files, manage attachments         |

### API response format

Tallyfy API responses follow standard conventions:
- All data returns as JSON.
- Standard HTTP status codes indicate outcomes (200 for success, 4xx/5xx for errors).
- Error responses include clear error messages.
- List endpoints support pagination.

### Rate limits

Tallyfy enforces rate limits per organization. If you're hitting limits regularly, implement caching or batching - and contact support for high-volume use cases.

### Getting started

1. **Get your API credentials** - Find your API keys/tokens at **Settings** > **Integrations** > **REST API** in Tallyfy.
2. **Read the API docs** - Browse the official [API reference](https://go.tallyfy.com/api/) for endpoint details.
3. **Check code examples** - See practical examples on [Tallyfy's GitHub repo](https://github.com/tallyfy/api-support/) in various programming languages.

:::note[Testing API calls]
Use tools like Postman, Insomnia, or `curl` to test API requests.
