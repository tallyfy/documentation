## Tallyfy API Integration Guide

Tallyfy provides a comprehensive REST API that enables developers to integrate workflow functionality into external applications and systems. This guide covers the essential steps and requirements for successful API integration.

:::note[API Documentation]
Complete API reference documentation is available at [https://go.tallyfy.com/api/](https://go.tallyfy.com/api/)
:::

### Required Headers

All direct API calls to Tallyfy endpoints must include the following header:

```
X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient
```

**Important**: Requests without this header will be automatically rejected.

### Authentication Methods

Tallyfy supports two authentication approaches depending on your integration scenario:

#### 1. User-Based Authentication

For integrations acting on behalf of a specific Tallyfy user:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Integrations > REST API** in your Tallyfy account
2. Copy your personal **access_token**
3. Include this token in the Authorization header of your API requests

This video demonstrates how to obtain your access token:

#### 2. Application-Based Authentication

For third-party applications or dedicated integrations requiring client credentials:

1. Contact Tallyfy Support with details about your integration requirements
2. Receive your application's **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
3. Implement the OAuth 2.0 flow to obtain and refresh access tokens

### Token Refresh Procedure

Access tokens expire periodically and must be refreshed for continued API access:

1. Store both the **access_token** and **refresh_token** when first obtained
2. When the access token expires, use the refresh token to obtain a new one
3. Send a POST request to the token endpoint with your refresh token

### Date Format Standards

When working with dates in the Tallyfy API:

| Direction | Format | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Request (to API) | YYYY-DD-MM HH:MM:SS | 2023-15-05 14:30:00 |
| Response (from API) | YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.000Z | 2023-05-15T14:30:00.000Z |

Ensure your code properly handles these date format conventions to avoid errors.

### Webhook Integration

For event-driven integrations, Tallyfy provides webhook capabilities that don't require direct API calls:

- Configure webhooks at the process or step level
- Receive real-time notifications when specific events occur
- Process the webhook payload to trigger actions in your systems

For details on webhook configuration, see the [webhooks setup guide](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/how-to-set-up-webhooks-in-tallyfy/).
