## Integrating with the Tallyfy REST API

Tallyfy's REST API lets you connect workflow features to your own applications and systems.

:::note[API documentation]
Full API reference at [https://go.tallyfy.com/api/](https://go.tallyfy.com/api/)
:::

## API terminology

The Tallyfy API uses different names than what you'll see in the web app. Here's the mapping:

-   API `Checklists` = **Templates** in the UI (containing **Steps**)
-   API `Runs` = **Processes** in the UI (containing **Tasks**)
-   API `Captures` = **Task form fields** in the UI
-   API `Preruns` = **Kick-off form fields** in the UI

Keep these distinctions in mind when reading the API docs - they'll help you match API data to what users actually see in Tallyfy.

### Required headers

Every API call must include these headers:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient
Accept: application/json
```

**Important**: Requests without the `X-Tallyfy-Client` header will be rejected.

### Authentication methods

Tallyfy supports two authentication approaches:

#### 1. User-based authentication

For integrations acting on behalf of a specific Tallyfy user:

<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings > Integrations > REST API** in your Tallyfy account
2. Copy your personal **access_token**
3. Include this token in the `Authorization` header of your API requests
</Steps>

This video shows how to get your access token:

#### 2. Application-based authentication

For third-party apps needing client credentials:

1. Contact Tallyfy Support describing your integration needs
2. You'll receive a **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
3. Implement the OAuth 2.0 flow to get and refresh access tokens

## OAuth authentication flow

This diagram shows the full OAuth flow for both authentication methods.

```d2
direction: right

App: Your Application {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#f5f5f5"
}

Auth: Tallyfy OAuth {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#e6f3ff"
}

API: Tallyfy API {
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#ffe6e6"
}

App -> Auth: "1. Request token\n(credentials)" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
}
Auth -> App: "2. Return access token\n& refresh token" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
}
App -> API: "3. API request with\nBearer token + headers" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
}
API -> App: "4. Successful response" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
}
App -> API: "5. API request\n(expired token)" {
  style.stroke: "#666"
  style.stroke-dash: 3
}
API -> App: "6. 401 Unauthorized" {
  style.stroke: "#666"
  style.stroke-dash: 3
}
App -> Auth: "7. Refresh token" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
}
Auth -> App: "8. New access token" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
}
App -> API: "9. Retry with\nnew token" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
}
API -> App: "10. Successful response" {
  style.stroke: "#333"
}
```

**What to notice:**
- Steps 1-4 show initial authentication - use password grant for user context or client credentials for app-only access
- Step 5 shows required headers for all API requests - both `Authorization` and `X-Tallyfy-Client` headers are mandatory
- Steps 6-10 show token refresh when a 401 error occurs - your app should handle this retry automatically

### Token management

#### Handling token invalidation

Personal access tokens are invalidated when users log out. To reduce disruption:

1. **Automated systems**: Use application tokens (Enterprise plans) instead of personal tokens when possible
2. **User-based integrations**:
   - Let users know that logging out breaks automations
   - Add error handling to detect invalidated tokens
   - Provide clear steps for getting new tokens after logout
3. **Monitoring**: Log authentication failures to spot patterns early

#### Token security

- Store tokens with encryption at rest
- Never expose tokens in client-side code or logs
- Rotate tokens regularly for sensitive operations
- Handle token expiration by refreshing automatically

### Working with multi-organization users

Tallyfy users can belong to multiple organizations[^1]. This matters for API integrations:

#### Organization context in API requests

- A user's access token is tied to their current organization
- API requests operate within that organization's context
- Organization IDs are required in most API endpoint URLs (e.g., `/organizations/{org_id}/checklists`)

#### Collecting organization IDs

When building integrations:

1. Collect the organization ID during setup
2. Store it alongside user credentials in your app
3. Include it in your API request URLs

#### Multiple organizations

For users belonging to more than one organization:

1. Let users pick which organization to work with
2. Store multiple organization IDs if your app spans organizations
3. Permissions and data differ between organizations
4. You may need updated tokens when switching organizations

:::tip[Organization switching]
Users can switch organizations in the Tallyfy UI. Learn more in [Switch between organizations](/products/pro/settings/personal-settings/how-can-i-switch-between-organizations-in-tallyfy/).
:::

### Getting access tokens with password grant

Getting 401 "Unauthenticated" errors despite having valid client credentials? You likely need the password grant flow.

:::note[Grant type selection]
The **client_credentials** grant type won't provide tokens that work for user-specific endpoints. For standard API endpoints requiring user context, you must use the **password** grant type.
:::

1. Make a POST request to the OAuth token endpoint:
```bash
POST https://go.tallyfy.com/api/oauth/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=password&
client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&
client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET&
username=YOUR_EMAIL&
password=YOUR_PASSWORD
```

2. You'll get a response with an access token:
```json
{
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "access_token": "eyJhbGci...",
  "refresh_token": "def50200..."
}
```

3. Use this token in the `Authorization` header:
```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

:::caution[Security note]
The password grant requires transmitting user credentials. Only use this in secure server-side environments where you control both the client app and user accounts.
:::

### Understanding grant types

| Grant type | Purpose | Access context | Best for |
|------------|---------|----------------|----------|
| **client_credentials** | App-to-app authentication | Application context only | Backend services, system integrations |
| **password** | User-based access via application | Full user context | Endpoints requiring user permissions |

**Key distinction**: Most Tallyfy API endpoints require user context, so `password` grant is usually what you need. If you're getting 401 errors with a `client_credentials` token, switch to `password` grant.

### Token refresh

Access tokens expire after 1 hour and need refreshing:

1. Store both the **access_token** and **refresh_token** when first obtained
2. When the access token expires, POST to the token endpoint with your refresh token
3. You'll receive a new access token (and sometimes a new refresh token)

This video shows the token refresh process:

<lite-vimeo videoid="326495493"></lite-vimeo>

### Troubleshooting authentication

#### 401 unauthenticated errors

1. **Token format**: Make sure your Authorization header is exactly:
   ```
   Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
   ```
   There must be exactly one space between "Bearer" and your token.

2. **Token expiration**: Tokens expire after 1 hour. Refresh or request a new one.

3. **Invalid credentials**: Double-check your client ID, client secret, username, and password.

4. **Missing headers**: Every request needs the `X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient` header.

5. **Wrong token endpoint**: Confirm you're hitting `https://go.tallyfy.com/api/oauth/token` with the correct `grant_type`.

6. **Logout invalidation**: Personal tokens are immediately invalidated on logout. If your automation stops working, check whether the user logged out.

If problems persist, check the response body for specific error messages or contact Tallyfy Support with your full error response.

#### CORS or preflight issues

For cross-origin challenges:
- Watch for CORS preflight (`OPTIONS`) requests
- Check response headers for CORS permissions
- Verify allowed origins and methods

### Preventing duplicate operations

:::tip[Implement idempotency]
External systems might send duplicate requests from network retries, user errors, or repeated webhook events. Implement [idempotency handling](/products/pro/integrations/handling-idempotency-in-webhooks-and-api/) to prevent unintended duplicate operations - especially when:
- Launching processes from external triggers
- Updating task form fields
- Completing tasks programmatically
:::

### Date format standards

When working with dates in the Tallyfy API:

| Direction | Format | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Request (to API) | YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS | 2025-05-15 14:30:00 |
| Response (from API) | ISO 8601 (Zulu time) | 2025-05-15T14:30:00.000Z |

Make sure your code handles both formats correctly.

### Webhook integration

For event-driven integrations, Tallyfy offers webhooks that don't require polling the API:

- Configure webhooks at the process or step level
- Get real-time notifications when specific events happen
- Process the webhook payload to trigger actions in your systems

For setup details, see the [webhooks setup guide](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/how-to-set-up-webhooks-in-tallyfy/).
