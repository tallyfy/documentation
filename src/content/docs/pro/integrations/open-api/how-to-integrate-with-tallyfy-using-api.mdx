## Tallyfy API Integration Guide

Tallyfy provides a REST API that enables developers to integrate workflow functionality into external applications and systems.

:::note[API Documentation]
Complete API reference documentation is available at [https://go.tallyfy.com/api/](https://go.tallyfy.com/api/)
:::

## API terminology

While the Tallyfy web application uses certain terms in its user interface, the underlying Tallyfy API sometimes uses different terms for the same concepts. Understanding these differences is important when working directly with the API.

Here's a mapping of key API objects to their corresponding terms in the Tallyfy **UI**:

-   API `Checklists` correspond to **Blueprints** in the UI. A **Blueprint** contains **Steps**.
-   API `Runs` correspond to **Processes** in the UI. A **Process** contains **Tasks**.
-   API `Captures` correspond to **Task form fields** in the UI.
-   API `Preruns` correspond to **Kick-off form fields** in the UI.

Keeping these distinctions in mind will help you navigate the API documentation and map API data to what users see in the Tallyfy application.

### Required headers

All direct API calls to Tallyfy endpoints must include the following header:

```
X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient
```

**Important**: Requests without this header will be automatically rejected.

### Authentication methods

Tallyfy supports two authentication approaches depending on your integration scenario:

#### 1. User-based authentication

For integrations acting on behalf of a specific Tallyfy user:

<Steps>
1. Navigate to **Settings > Integrations > REST API** in your Tallyfy account
2. Copy your personal **access_token**
3. Include this token in the Authorization header of your API requests
</Steps>

This video demonstrates how to obtain your access token:

<lite-vimeo videoid="326494868"></lite-vimeo>

#### 2. Application-based authentication

For third-party applications or dedicated Tallyfy integrations requiring client credentials:

1. Contact Tallyfy Support with details about your integration requirements
2. Receive your application's **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
3. Implement the OAuth 2.0 flow to obtain and refresh access tokens

## OAuth authentication flow

This diagram shows the complete OAuth authentication flow for both user-based and application-based authentication methods.

```mermaid

 autonumber
 participant App as Your Application
 participant Auth as Tallyfy OAuth
 participant API as Tallyfy API
 
 Note over App,API: OAuth Authentication Flow
 
 alt Password Grant (User Context)
 App->>Auth: POST /oauth/token grant_type=password client_id, client_secret username, password
 Auth->>App: access_token + refresh_token expires_in: 3600
 else Client Credentials Grant (App Context)
 App->>Auth: POST /oauth/token grant_type=client_credentials client_id, client_secret
 Auth->>App: access_token (limited scope) expires_in: 3600
 end
 
 App->>API: API Request Authorization: Bearer {token} X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient
 
 alt Token Valid
 API->>App: 200 OK + Response Data
 else Token Expired
 API->>App: 401 Unauthenticated
 App->>Auth: POST /oauth/token grant_type=refresh_token refresh_token={token}
 Auth->>App: New access_token
 App->>API: Retry with new token
 API->>App: 200 OK + Response Data
 end
```

**What to notice:**
- Step 1-4 show the initial authentication - choose password grant for user context or client credentials for app-only access
- Step 5 demonstrates required headers for all API requests - both Authorization and X-Tallyfy-Client headers are mandatory
- Steps 6-10 illustrate automatic token refresh when a 401 error occurs - your application should implement this retry logic

### Best practices for token management

To ensure stable API integrations, follow these token management best practices:

#### Handling token invalidation

Personal access tokens are invalidated when users log out. To minimize disruption:

1. **For automated systems**: Use application tokens (Enterprise plans) instead of personal tokens when possible
2. **For user-based integrations**: 
   - Educate users that logging out will break automations
   - Implement error handling to detect invalidated tokens
   - Provide clear instructions for obtaining new tokens after logout
3. **Monitor token health**: Implement logging to track authentication failures and identify patterns

#### Token security

- Store tokens securely using encryption at rest
- Never expose tokens in client-side code or logs
- Rotate tokens regularly for sensitive operations
- Implement token expiration handling to refresh tokens automatically

### Working with multi-organization users

Tallyfy supports users belonging to multiple organizations (tenants). This has important implications for API integrations:

#### Organization context in API requests

- A user's access token is tied to their current organization context
- Tallyfy API requests will operate within the organization context associated with the token
- Organization IDs are required in many API endpoints

#### Collecting and storing Organization IDs

When building integrations that require organization-specific data:

1. Collect the organization ID during user onboarding or application setup
2. Store this ID alongside user credentials in your application
3. Include the organization ID in relevant Tallyfy API requests

#### Handling users with multiple organizations

For users who belong to multiple organizations:

1. Consider allowing users to select which organization they want to work with
2. Store multiple organization IDs if your application needs to work across organizations
3. Be aware that permissions and available data may vary between organizations
4. For users switching between organizations, you may need to update tokens or credentials

:::tip[Organization Switching]
Users can switch between organizations in the Tallyfy interface using the Organization Switcher. Learn more in [Switch Between Organizations](/products/pro/settings/personal-settings/how-can-i-switch-between-organizations-in-tallyfy/).

### Obtaining access tokens with password grant

If you're receiving a 401 "Unauthenticated" error despite having valid client credentials, you may need to use the password grant authentication flow:

:::note[Grant Type Selection]
The **client_credentials** grant type will not provide access tokens that work for user-specific endpoints. For accessing standard API endpoints that require user context, you must use the **password** grant type as shown below.
:::

1. Make a POST request to the OAuth token endpoint:
```bash
POST https://go.tallyfy.com/api/oauth/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=client_credentials&
client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&
client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET
```

2. You'll receive a response with an access token:
```json
{
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "access_token": "eyJhbGci..."
}
```

3. Use this token in subsequent API requests in the Authorization header:
```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

:::caution[Security Note]
The password grant type requires transmitting user credentials. Use this method only in secure environments where you control both the client application and user accounts.
:::

### Understanding grant types

| Grant Type | Purpose | Access Context | Suitable For |
|------------|---------|----------------|--------------|
| **client_credentials** | Application-to-application authentication | Application context only | Backend services, system integrations |
| **password** | User-based access via application | Full user context | APIs requiring user permissions, accessing user data |

**Important distinction**: 
- Tokens obtained with `client_credentials` grant type can only access endpoints that don't require user context
- Most Tallyfy API endpoints require user context, so the `password` grant is necessary for accessing these endpoints
- If you're getting 401 "Unauthenticated" errors when using an access token from `client_credentials`, switch to the `password` grant type

### Token refresh procedure

Access tokens expire periodically and must be refreshed for continued API access:

1. Store both the **access_token** and **refresh_token** when first obtained
2. When the access token expires, use the refresh token to obtain a new one
3. Send a POST request to the token endpoint with your refresh token

![Token refresh request example](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/file-tucOMxuFnH.png)

This video demonstrates the token refresh process:

### Troubleshooting authentication issues

If you encounter authentication problems when using the Tallyfy API, check these common issues:

#### 401 Unauthenticated errors

1. **Invalid Token Format**: Ensure your Authorization header uses the exact format:
   ```
   Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
   ```
   *Note: There should be exactly one space between "Bearer" and your token.*

2. **Token Expiration**: Tokens typically expire after 1 hour. Implement token refresh logic or request a new token.

3. **Invalid Credentials**: Verify your client ID, client secret, username, and password are correct.

4. **Missing Required Headers**: Ensure all API requests include the `X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient` header.

5. **Incorrect Token Request**: When requesting a token, verify:
   - You're using the correct endpoint (`https://go.tallyfy.com/api/oauth/token`)
   - The `grant_type` parameter matches your authentication flow
   - All required parameters for your grant type are included

6. **Token Invalidated by Logout**: Personal access tokens are immediately invalidated when users log out of Tallyfy. This common issue affects automations that rely on user tokens. If your automation suddenly stops working, verify the user hasn't logged out.

If problems persist, check the response body for specific error messages or contact Tallyfy Support with details about your API implementation and the full error response.

#### CORS or preflight issues

For cross-origin implementation challenges:
- Note any CORS preflight (`OPTIONS`) requests
- Check response headers for CORS permissions
- Understand allowed origins and methods

### Preventing duplicate operations

:::tip[Implement idempotency]
When integrating with the Tallyfy API, external systems might send duplicate requests due to network retries, user errors, or webhook events firing multiple times. Implement [idempotency handling](/products/pro/integrations/handling-idempotency-in-webhooks-and-api/) to ensure operations aren't performed multiple times unintentionally. This is especially important when:
- Launching processes from external triggers
- Updating task form fields
- Completing tasks programmatically
:::

### Date format standards

When working with dates in the Tallyfy API:

| Direction | Format | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Request (to API) | YYYY-DD-MM HH:MM:SS | 2023-15-05 14:30:00 |
| Response (from API) | YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.000Z | 2023-05-15T14:30:00.000Z |

Ensure your code properly handles these date format conventions to avoid errors.

### Webhook integration

For event-driven integrations, Tallyfy provides webhook capabilities that don't require direct API calls:

- Configure webhooks at the process or step level
- Receive real-time notifications when specific events occur
- Process the webhook payload to trigger actions in your systems

For details on webhook configuration, see the [webhooks setup guide](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/how-to-set-up-webhooks-in-tallyfy/).
