## Everything you need to know to integrate Tallyfy's API

Welcome to Tallyfy! If you want to integrate our amazing features into your workflow, we've got you covered. Our open REST API allows you to explore and integrate with Tallyfy seamlessly. Exciting, right?

Important - if you make API calls directly to the Tallyfy API endpoint, you must supply an additional header in your requests `X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient` otherwise your requests will be dropped.

## Getting Started

:::note[Find our API documentation]
You can find our full API documentation following [this link](https://go.tallyfy.com/api/)
:::


To get started, you'll need your **access_token**. If you're on the PRO plan, this is your ticket to using our APIs. Don't worry, we'll show you how to get it.

### Ordinary API Usage as a Specific Member

1. If you're already a Tallyfy member, simply log in and go to Settings > Integrations > REST API. Voila! You'll find your **access_token** there.

2. For a detailed, step-by-step guide, check out this video:

### Client apps or dedicated integrations

If you're building a dedicated integration or a client app, we've got you covered too. Just contact our amazing Tallyfy Support team with the required details, and they'll provide you with the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** you need.

## Refreshing your access token

Need a newer **access_token**? No problem! Just use the **refresh_token** you received earlier and follow these simple steps:

## Date formatting in our API

We want to make sure your date and timestamp formatting is spot on in our API. When making requests, use this format: "YYYY-DD-MM HH:MM:SS". On the other hand, our API responds with this format: "YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.000Z".

## Webhooks and More

Did you know that you can emit step-level or process-level webhooks from Tallyfy without using the API?. You can learn how to set up webhooks [here.](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/how-to-set-up-webhooks-in-tallyfy/)
