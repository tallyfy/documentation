## Monitoring Tallyfy API Calls with Chrome DevTools

Tallyfy's "API-first" architecture enables developers to understand how the platform communicates with its backend. By inspecting these Tallyfy API calls, you can implement your own integrations.

### Requirements

Before starting:
- Chrome browser (latest version recommended)
- A Tallyfy account with appropriate permissions
- Basic understanding of HTTP requests and JSON
- Familiarity with the Tallyfy feature you want to analyze

:::note[API Documentation]
Complete API reference documentation is available at [https://go.tallyfy.com/api/](https://go.tallyfy.com/api/)
:::

### Important API header requirement

When making direct API calls to Tallyfy endpoints, you must always include this header:

```
X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient
```

:::caution[Header Requirement]
Requests without this header will be automatically rejected. This is a security measure.

## Capturing API calls with Chrome DevTools

### Setup process

<Steps>
1. Navigate to the Tallyfy web application and sign in.
2. Open Chrome DevTools by right-clicking anywhere and selecting **Inspect**.
3. Click the **Network** tab in the DevTools panel.
4. Ensure recording is enabled (the red record button should be active).
5. Check the **Preserve log** checkbox to maintain requests between page loads.
6. Select **Disable cache** to ensure fresh responses.
7. Clear existing requests by clicking the ðŸš« icon.
8. Perform the Tallyfy action you want to analyze (e.g., load processes, launch a process, complete a task).
9. Click the **Fetch/XHR** filter button at the top of the Network panel.
10. Type `/api/` in the filter box to show only Tallyfy API calls.
11. Click on a Tallyfy `/api/` request in the filtered list to open its details.
</Steps>

### Analyzing request details

#### Request headers section

In the **Headers** tab, examine:

- **General information**: 
  - Request URL: The full endpoint path
  - Request method: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
  - Status code: 200 (success), 400 (client error), etc.

- **Request Headers**: 
  - `Authorization: Bearer <token>` for authentication
  - `X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient` required for direct API calls
  - `Content-Type: application/json` for data formatting

- **Response Headers**: 
  - Server response metadata
  - Rate limiting information
  - Caching directives

#### Request payload section

For POST, PUT, or PATCH requests:

- Click the **Payload** tab to view the request body
- Review the following views:
  - **Form Data**: URL-encoded parameters
  - **Request Payload**: JSON structure
  - **View Source**: Raw data exactly as sent

- Copy method:
  <Steps>
  1. Select the **view source** tab
  2. Click anywhere in the payload area
  3. Select all the text
  4. Copy the selected text
  5. This exact format can be used in your own Tallyfy API implementations
  </Steps>

#### Response data section

Examine the server's response:

- Click the **Response** tab to view raw data returned from the server
- Click the **Preview** tab to see formatted JSON structure
- Analyze:
  - Data objects and their structure
  - Success/error messages
  - Pagination information for list responses
  - Timestamps and formatting patterns

### Authentication analysis

When examining authentication in Tallyfy API calls:

- **Bearer Token Format**: Note the structure and length of the JWT token
- **Token Lifespan**: Tokens typically expire after a set period
- **Scope Information**: What permissions the token includes
- **User Context**: Which user the token represents

#### Required headers for API replication

| Header | Value | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `Authorization` | `Bearer YOUR_TOKEN` | Authentication |
| `X-Tallyfy-Client` | `APIClient` | Required identifier |
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` | Format specification |
| `Accept` | `application/json` | Response format |

### Testing your API understanding

To verify you've correctly understood a Tallyfy API call:

<Steps>
1. Copy the endpoint URL, headers, and payload
2. Use a tool like Postman, Insomnia, or cURL to recreate the request
3. Compare your response with what you observed in DevTools
4. Troubleshoot any differences in the responses
</Steps>

#### Example cURL command

For a typical Tallyfy API call, your cURL might look like:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://go.tallyfy.com/api/organizations/{orgID}/processes" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient" \
  -d '{
    "template_id": 12345,
    "name": "Test Process",
    "assignees": [{"email": "user@example.com"}]
  }'
```

### Advanced DevTools features

#### Throttling network speed

To test how your Tallyfy API implementation performs under different conditions:

<Steps>
1. Click the **Network Conditions** tab in DevTools (or use the dropdown next to "Online")
2. Select a preset throttling profile or create a custom one
3. Observe how the API behaves with slower connections
</Steps>

#### Exporting request data

To save a request for later reference:

<Steps>
1. Right-click on the API request
2. Select **Copy** > **Copy as cURL**
3. Paste into a text file for future reference
</Steps>

#### Using Integuru for automated API integration

For developers looking to automate API interactions with Tallyfy or other platforms, [Integuru](https://github.com/Integuru-AI/Integuru/) provides an advanced solution. Integuru is an open-source AI agent that can generate integration code by reverse-engineering platforms' internal API

Key features:
- Automatically generates a dependency graph of API requests
- Creates runnable Python code that reproduces your actions
- Identifies relationships between different API calls
- Handles authentication and session management

To use Integuru with Tallyfy:

<Steps>
1. Install Integuru following the instructions on their GitHub repository
2. Run `python create_har.py` to start a browser session
3. Log into Tallyfy and perform the workflow action you want to automate
4. Use the generated HAR file with Integuru to create Python code that reproduces the API calls
</Steps>

This approach can significantly accelerate API integration development by automatically analyzing the full sequence of API calls needed for complex operations.

### Troubleshooting common issues

#### No requests appearing

If no API calls appear in DevTools:
- Ensure DevTools is open before performing the action
- Try enabling **Preserve log** option in the Network tab
- Disable cache and perform a hard refresh
- Verify you're looking at the correct browser tab
- Check if content blockers are interfering with network requests

#### Filtering problems

If filtering doesn't show expected results:
- Verify the filter string exactly matches part of the API URL
- Try the built-in **Fetch/XHR** filter instead of text filtering
- Clear all filters to check if requests appear at all
- Ensure your browser isn't blocking certain requests

#### Authentication errors

If calls return HTTP 401 or similar errors:
- Verify your Tallyfy session is active
- Check that your API token is valid and properly formatted
- Ensure all required headers are included in your requests
- Confirm your user account has permission for the requested action

#### CORS or preflight issues

For cross-origin implementation challenges:
- Note any CORS preflight (`OPTIONS`) requests
- Check response headers for CORS permissions
- Understand allowed origins and methods

### Security considerations

When working with API calls:

- **Never share authentication tokens** publicly
- **Mask sensitive data** in screenshots or shared requests
- **Be aware of data access implications** when replicating calls
- **Remember that all actions through the API are tracked** in audit logs
