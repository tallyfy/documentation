## Inspecting Tallyfy API calls with Chrome DevTools

Tallyfy uses an API-first architecture, which means every action in the web app makes API calls you can inspect. By watching these calls in Chrome DevTools, you can figure out exactly how to replicate them for your own integrations.

### Before you start

- Chrome browser (latest version recommended)
- A Tallyfy account with the right permissions
- Basic understanding of HTTP requests and JSON

:::note[API documentation]
Full API reference is available at [https://go.tallyfy.com/api/](https://go.tallyfy.com/api/)
:::

### Required API header

When making direct API calls to Tallyfy, you must always include this header:

```
X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient
```

:::caution[Header requirement]
Requests without this header will be rejected. It's a security requirement.

## Capturing API calls

### Setting up DevTools

<Steps>
1. Sign in to Tallyfy in Chrome.
2. Right-click anywhere on the page and select **Inspect** to open DevTools.
3. Click the **Network** tab.
4. Make sure recording is active (the red record button should be filled in).
5. Check **Preserve log** to keep requests between page navigations.
6. Check **Disable cache** for fresh responses.
7. Clear existing entries by clicking the clear button.
8. Perform the Tallyfy action you want to analyze - load a template, launch a process, complete a task, etc.
9. Click the **Fetch/XHR** filter at the top of the Network panel.
10. Type `/api/` in the filter box to show only Tallyfy API calls.
11. Click any request in the filtered list to open its details.
</Steps>

### Reading request details

#### Headers tab

In the **Headers** tab, you'll find:

- **General info**: The full request URL, HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), and status code (200 for success, 400 for client errors, etc.)

- **Request headers**: Look for `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, `X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient`, and `Content-Type: application/json`

- **Response headers**: Server metadata, rate limiting info, and caching directives

#### Payload tab

For POST, PUT, or PATCH requests, click the **Payload** tab to see what was sent:

- **Form Data** shows URL-encoded parameters
- **Request Payload** shows the JSON body
- **View Source** shows the raw data exactly as sent

To copy the payload:
<Steps>
1. Click the **view source** subtab.
2. Select all the text in the payload area.
3. Copy it - you can use this exact format in your own API calls.
</Steps>

#### Response tab

Check what came back from the server:

- The **Response** tab shows raw data
- The **Preview** tab shows formatted JSON

Look at data structure, success/error messages, pagination info, and timestamp formats.

### Required headers for replicating calls

| Header | Value | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `Authorization` | `Bearer YOUR_TOKEN` | Authentication |
| `X-Tallyfy-Client` | `APIClient` | Required identifier |
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` | Request format |
| `Accept` | `application/json` | Response format |

### Testing your captured calls

To verify you've correctly captured a Tallyfy API call:

<Steps>
1. Copy the endpoint URL, headers, and payload from DevTools.
2. Recreate the request using Postman, Insomnia, or cURL.
3. Compare your response with what you saw in DevTools.
4. Troubleshoot any differences.
</Steps>

#### Example cURL command

Here's what a typical Tallyfy API call looks like in cURL - this one launches a process from a template:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://go.tallyfy.com/api/organizations/{org_id}/runs" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "checklist_id": "abc123",
    "name": "Test Process"
  }'
```

### Useful DevTools features

#### Exporting a request as cURL

<Steps>
1. Right-click on any API request in the Network panel.
2. Select **Copy** > **Copy as cURL**.
3. Paste it into a terminal or text file - it'll include all headers and auth tokens automatically.
</Steps>

#### Throttling network speed

You can simulate slow connections to test how your integration handles latency. Click the dropdown next to **Online** in the Network panel and pick a throttling preset.

### Troubleshooting

#### No requests showing up

- Make sure DevTools is open *before* you perform the action
- Enable **Preserve log** in the Network tab
- Disable cache and hard-refresh the page
- Check you're looking at the correct browser tab

#### Filter isn't showing results

- Verify the filter text matches part of the API URL
- Try clicking **Fetch/XHR** instead of using the text filter
- Clear all filters to confirm requests exist at all

#### Getting 401 authentication errors

- Check that your Tallyfy session is still active
- Verify the Bearer token hasn't expired
- Make sure all required headers are included
- Confirm your account has permission for the action

#### CORS or preflight issues

If you're making cross-origin requests from your own app:
- Watch for `OPTIONS` preflight requests in DevTools
- Check the response headers for allowed origins and methods

### Security reminders

- **Never share your auth tokens** publicly or in screenshots
- **Mask sensitive data** before sharing request details
- **All API actions are logged** in Tallyfy's audit trail
