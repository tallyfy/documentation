## Monitoring Tallyfy API Calls with Chrome DevTools

Tallyfy's "API-first" architecture enables developers to understand exactly how the platform communicates with its backend. By inspecting these API calls, you can more effectively implement your own integrations.

### Prerequisites

Before starting:
- Chrome browser (latest version recommended)
- A Tallyfy account with appropriate permissions
- Basic understanding of HTTP requests and JSON
- Familiarity with the Tallyfy feature you want to analyze

:::note[API Documentation]
Complete API reference documentation is available at [https://go.tallyfy.com/api/](https://go.tallyfy.com/api/)
:::

### Important API Header Requirement

When making direct API calls to Tallyfy endpoints, you must include this header:

```
X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient
```

:::caution[Critical Requirement]
Requests without this header will be automatically rejected without error messages. This is a security measure and cannot be bypassed.

## Capturing API Calls with Chrome DevTools

### Setup Process

1. **Open Chrome DevTools**
   - Navigate to the Tallyfy web application and sign in
   - Right-click anywhere and select **Inspect** (or press `F12`)
   - Alternatively, use keyboard shortcuts:
     - Windows/Linux: `Ctrl+Shift+I` or `F12`
     - macOS: `Cmd+Option+I`
   - The DevTools panel will appear docked to the side or bottom

2. **Access Network Tab**
   - Click the **Network** tab in the DevTools panel
   - Ensure recording is enabled (red record button should be active)
   - Check the **Preserve log** checkbox to maintain requests between page loads
   - Select **Disable cache** to ensure fresh responses

3. **Clear Existing Requests**
   - Click the ðŸš« icon to clear all current network requests
   - This provides a clean slate for capturing only the specific API calls

4. **Perform the Target Action**
   - With Network tab open, perform the action you want to analyze
   - For example: load a list of processes, launch a new process, or complete a task
   - The Network tab will populate with requests as they occur

5. **Filter for API Requests**
   - Click the **Fetch/XHR** filter button at the top of the Network panel
   - Type `/api/` in the filter box to show only Tallyfy API calls
   - The request list will now display only relevant API calls

6. **Select an API Call**
   - Click any Tallyfy `/api/` request in the filtered list
   - This opens the details pane showing headers, payload, and response

## Analyzing Request Details

### Request Headers Section

In the **Headers** tab, examine:

- **General information**: 
  - Request URL: The full endpoint path
  - Request method: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
  - Status code: 200 (success), 400 (client error), etc.

- **Request Headers**: 
  - `Authorization: Bearer <token>` for authentication
  - `X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient` required for direct API calls
  - `Content-Type: application/json` for data formatting

- **Response Headers**: 
  - Server response metadata
  - Rate limiting information
  - Caching directives

### Request Payload Section

For POST, PUT, or PATCH requests:

- Click the **Payload** tab to view the request body
- Review the following views:
  - **Form Data**: URL-encoded parameters
  - **Request Payload**: JSON structure
  - **View Source**: Raw data exactly as sent

- Copy method:
  1. Select the **view source** tab
  2. Click anywhere in the payload area
  3. Press `Ctrl+A` (or `Cmd+A` on Mac) to select all
  4. Press `Ctrl+C` (or `Cmd+C` on Mac) to copy
  5. This exact format can be used in your own API implementations

### Response Data Section

Examine the server's response:

- Click the **Response** tab to view raw data returned from the server
- Click the **Preview** tab to see formatted JSON structure
- Analyze:
  - Data objects and their structure
  - Success/error messages
  - Pagination information for list responses
  - Timestamps and formatting patterns

## Authentication Analysis

When examining authentication in Tallyfy API calls:

- **Bearer Token Format**: Note the structure and length of the JWT token
- **Token Lifespan**: Tokens typically expire after a set period
- **Scope Information**: What permissions the token includes
- **User Context**: Which user the token represents

### Required Headers for API Replication

| Header | Value | Purpose |
|--------|-------|---------|
| `Authorization` | `Bearer YOUR_TOKEN` | Authentication |
| `X-Tallyfy-Client` | `APIClient` | Required identifier |
| `Content-Type` | `application/json` | Format specification |
| `Accept` | `application/json` | Response format |

## Testing Your API Understanding

To verify you've correctly understood an API call:

1. Copy the endpoint URL, headers, and payload
2. Use a tool like Postman, Insomnia, or cURL to recreate the request
3. Compare your response with what you observed in DevTools
4. Troubleshoot any differences in the responses

### Example cURL Command

For a typical API call, your cURL might look like:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://go.tallyfy.com/api/organizations/{orgID}/processes" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient" \
  -d '{
    "template_id": 12345,
    "name": "Test Process",
    "assignees": [{"email": "user@example.com"}]
  }'
```

## Advanced DevTools Features

### Throttling Network Speed

To test how your API implementation performs under different conditions:

1. Click the **Network Conditions** tab in DevTools (or use the dropdown next to "Online")
2. Select a preset throttling profile or create a custom one
3. Observe how the API behaves with slower connections

### Exporting Request Data

To save a request for later reference:

1. Right-click on the API request
2. Select **Copy** > **Copy as cURL**
3. Paste into a text file for future reference

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### No Requests Appearing

If no API calls appear in DevTools:
- Ensure DevTools is open before performing the action
- Try enabling **Preserve log** option in the Network tab
- Disable cache and perform a hard refresh (`Ctrl+Shift+R` or `Cmd+Shift+R`)
- Verify you're looking at the correct browser tab
- Check if content blockers are interfering with network requests

### Filtering Problems

If filtering doesn't show expected results:
- Verify the filter string exactly matches part of the API URL
- Try the built-in **Fetch/XHR** filter instead of text filtering
- Clear all filters to check if requests appear at all
- Ensure your browser isn't blocking certain requests

### Authentication Errors

If calls return HTTP 401 or similar errors:
- Verify your Tallyfy session is active
- Check that your API token is valid and properly formatted
- Ensure all required headers are included in your requests
- Confirm your user account has permission for the requested action

### Cors or Preflight Issues

For cross-origin implementation challenges:
- Note any CORS preflight (`OPTIONS`) requests
- Check response headers for CORS permissions
- Understand allowed origins and methods

## Security Considerations

When working with API calls:

- **Never share authentication tokens** publicly
- **Mask sensitive data** in screenshots or shared requests
- **Be aware of data access implications** when replicating calls
- **Remember that all actions through the API are tracked** in audit logs
