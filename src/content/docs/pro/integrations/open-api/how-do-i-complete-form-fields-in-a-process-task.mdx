## Completing Form Fields via API

This guide explains how to programmatically complete form fields in Tallyfy tasks using the REST API. You'll learn how to structure API requests for different field types and understand the available endpoints for task updates.

:::note[API Documentation]
Complete API reference documentation is available at [https://go.tallyfy.com/api/](https://go.tallyfy.com/api/)
:::

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- A valid API access token
- Organization ID (`{org}`)
- Run ID (`{run_id}`) and Task ID (`{task_id}`) for the target task
- Field IDs for the form fields you want to complete

### Required Headers

All API requests must include these headers:

```
Authorization: Bearer {your_access_token}
Content-Type: application/json
X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient
```

:::caution[Important]
The `X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient` header is required for all direct API calls to Tallyfy endpoints. Requests without this header will be rejected.

## API Endpoints for Form Field Updates

Tallyfy offers two approaches for updating form fields:

| Endpoint | HTTP Method | Description |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| `/organizations/{org}/runs/{run_id}/completed-tasks` | POST | Updates form fields and marks the task as complete |
| `/organizations/{org}/runs/{run_id}/tasks/{task_id}` | PUT | Updates form fields without completing the task |

### Process Flow

1. **Retrieve Task Information** (Optional)
   
   Make a GET request to obtain current task data:
   
   ```
   GET https://go.tallyfy.com/api/organizations/{org}/me/tasks
   ```

2. **Prepare Form Field Data**
   
   Structure your payload according to the field types you need to update

3. **Submit Form Data**
   
   Send the request to either update fields only or update and complete the task

## Payload Structure for Different Field Types

The basic structure for all field updates is:

```json
{
  "taskdata": {
    "field_id_1": value_1,
    "field_id_2": value_2,
    ...
  }
}
```

Where `field_id_x` is the unique identifier for each form field, and `value_x` varies based on the field type.

### Text Fields (Short Text & Text Area)

```json
{
  "taskdata": {
    "e4238158ad0949d4ad78c55125b28a99": "Sample text input",
    "ad789434de1c4d5fade2193d237c5716": "Longer text area content with multiple sentences if needed"
  }
}
```

### Radio Button Selection

```json
{
  "taskdata": {
    "7a54e215a9904096851360917080599f": "yes"
  }
}
```

### Date Fields

```json
{
  "taskdata": {
    "8c0161f92eba4d3da7182fed348f3421": "2024-12-20T14:23:18.128Z"
  }
}
```

### Dropdown Selection

```json
{
  "taskdata": {
    "0e4b280880cc4407a06478a2faa8052b": {
      "id": 2,
      "text": "Office 365",
      "value": null
    }
  }
}
```

### Multi-select Checkboxes

```json
{
  "taskdata": {
    "fe316c2ac44a421cafbf128c9462b8e9": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "text": "Slack",
        "value": null,
        "required": true,
        "selected": true
      },
      {
        "id": 4,
        "text": "Forms",
        "value": null,
        "selected": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Complete Example

This example shows a PUT request to update multiple field types without completing the task:

```
PUT https://go.tallyfy.com/api/organizations/{org}/runs/{runID}/tasks/{taskID}
```

```json
{
  "taskdata": {
    "e4238158ad0949d4ad78c55125b28a99": "Marketing campaign proposal",
    "ad789434de1c4d5fade2193d237c5716": "This campaign targets small business owners in the Midwest region.",
    "7a54e215a9904096851360917080599f": "yes",
    "8c0161f92eba4d3da7182fed348f3421": "2024-12-20T14:23:18.128Z",
    "0e4b280880cc4407a06478a2faa8052b": {
      "id": 2,
      "text": "Office 365",
      "value": null
    },
    "fe316c2ac44a421cafbf128c9462b8e9": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "text": "Slack",
        "value": null,
        "required": true,
        "selected": true
      },
      {
        "id": 4,
        "text": "Forms",
        "value": null,
        "selected": true
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Task Completion with Form Fields

To update form fields and complete the task in a single request:

```
POST https://go.tallyfy.com/api/organizations/{org}/runs/{run_id}/completed-tasks
```

```json
{
  "taskId": "{task_id}",
  "taskdata": {
    "field_id_1": "value_1",
    "field_id_2": "value_2"
  }
}
```

## Finding Field IDs

If you don't know the field IDs:

1. Use the Chrome Developer Tools to inspect network requests while interacting with the form in the Tallyfy web interface
2. Look for requests to `/tasks` or `/completed-tasks` endpoints
3. Examine the request payloads to identify field IDs and their expected data formats

For more information on inspecting API calls, see the article on [Sniffing API Calls Using Chrome](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/how-to-sniff-api-calls-using-chrome/).

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| 401 Unauthorized | Verify your access token is valid and not expired |
| 403 Forbidden | Check that your API user has permissions for the task |
| 400 Bad Request | Ensure your payload matches the expected format for the field type |
| Field not updating | Verify the field ID is correct and the field is editable in the current task state |
