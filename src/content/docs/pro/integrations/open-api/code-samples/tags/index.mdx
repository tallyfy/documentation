Tags let you label and filter templates, processes, tasks, and steps across your organization. Every endpoint is org-scoped under `/organizations/{org_id}/tags`.

## Available endpoints

| Operation | Method | Path | Response |
|-----------|--------|------|----------|
| List tags | `GET` | `/organizations/{org_id}/tags` | 200 with paginated array |
| Create tag | `POST` | `/organizations/{org_id}/tags` | 201 with created tag |
| Get tag | `GET` | `/organizations/{org_id}/tags/{tag_id}` | 200 with tag object |
| Update tag | `PUT` | `/organizations/{org_id}/tags/{tag_id}` | 200 with updated tag |
| Delete tag | `DELETE` | `/organizations/{org_id}/tags/{tag_id}` | 204 No Content |

## Key facts

- **title** is required, must be unique within the org, and is capped at 30 characters.
- **color** is optional and must be exactly 7 characters (a `#` hex value like `#ff5733`).
- Deleting a tag is permanent -- the API uses a hard delete, so deleted tags cannot be recovered.
- Add `?with=statistics` to any GET request to include usage counts (active/archived templates and processes).
- The response object returns: `id`, `title`, `color`, `auto_generated`, `created_at`, and `deleted_at`.
