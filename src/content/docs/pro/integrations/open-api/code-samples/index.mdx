This section provides practical code examples for common operations using the Tallyfy REST API. Select a category below to find samples in Javascript, Python, Java, and Go.

Choose a category to get started:

All code examples assume you have obtained your **Personal Access Token** or generated appropriate OAuth tokens. The base URL for API calls (unless otherwise noted) is `https://go.tallyfy.com/api`.

Remember to include the following headers in your requests:

-   `Authorization: Bearer {your_access_token}`
-   `Accept: application/json`
-   `X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient`
-   `Content-Type: application/json` (for requests with a JSON body, like POST or PUT)
