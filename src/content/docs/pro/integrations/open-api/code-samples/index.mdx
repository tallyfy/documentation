Each category below has working code samples in JavaScript, Python, Java, Go, C++, and C# for the Tallyfy REST API. Pick a resource to get started.

All examples assume you've got a **Personal Access Token** or valid OAuth token. The base URL is `https://go.tallyfy.com/api`, and every endpoint is org-scoped under `/organizations/{org_id}/...`.

Include these headers with every request:

- `Authorization: Bearer {your_access_token}`
- `Accept: application/json`
- `X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient`
- `Content-Type: application/json` (for POST/PUT requests with a JSON body)
