Every Tallyfy API request needs authentication. Pick the method that fits your use case:

- **Personal access token** -- grab your token from **Settings > Integrations > REST API** in Tallyfy and pass it in the `Authorization` header. Tokens last 6 months and act as the logged-in user. Best for scripts, testing, and quick integrations.
- **Client credentials flow** -- use a `client_id` and `client_secret` (provided by Tallyfy Support) to get an application-level token via `POST https://go.tallyfy.com/oauth/token`. App tokens last 7 days. Best for backend services that don't need a user session.

### Required headers

Include these three headers on every API call:

| Header | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `Authorization` | `Bearer {access_token}` |
| `Accept` | `application/json` |
| `X-Tallyfy-Client` | `APIClient` |

Omitting `X-Tallyfy-Client` or `Accept` will cause requests to fail.
