title: Authentication methods
---

Authentication is required for almost all Tallyfy API endpoints. Choose a method below based on your use case:

Remember to include the necessary headers (`Authorization`, `Accept`, `X-Tallyfy-Client`) in all your requests as shown in the examples.

import { CardGrid, LinkTitleCard} from "~/components";

<CardGrid>
<LinkTitleCard header="<b>Personal Access Token</b>" href="./personal-access-token/"> The simplest method for individual users or scripts. Get your token directly from Tallyfy settings. </LinkTitleCard>
<LinkTitleCard header="<b>Client Credentials Flow</b>" href="./client-credentials-flow/"> For third-party applications or backend services authenticating independently or on behalf of users (requires setup by Tallyfy Support). </LinkTitleCard>
<LinkTitleCard header="<b>OAuth Authorization Code Flow</b>" href="../oauth-authorization-flow/"> For third-party applications requiring explicit user consent to act on their behalf. </LinkTitleCard>
