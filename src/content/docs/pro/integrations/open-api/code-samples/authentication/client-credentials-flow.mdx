snippet: Learn how to authenticate third-party applications using the OAuth 2.0 Client
  Credentials grant type.
title: Use the Client Credentials Flow
---

## Overview

The OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials flow is designed for machine-to-machine authentication, typically used by third-party applications or backend services that need to interact with the Tallyfy API independently or on behalf of users within an organization.

This method requires you to first obtain a `Client ID` and `Client Secret` from Tallyfy Support.

:::caution[Enterprise Feature & Setup Required]
The client credentials grant type is only available to paid Tallyfy organizations and requires manual setup by Tallyfy Support. It is not accessible during free trials or by default. Contact Tallyfy Support to request access and provide details about your integration use case.
:::

### Use cases

This integration pattern is ideal for:

-   Embedding Tallyfy functionality within your own software.
-   Providing seamless workflow capabilities to your users without them needing separate Tallyfy logins visible in your app.
-   Automating process management or user provisioning programmatically.
-   System-level integrations (e.g., reporting, data synchronization).
-   Handle user provisioning programmatically

### Steps

#### 1. Request client credentials

-   Contact Tallyfy Support to request client credentials (`Client ID` and `Client Secret`).
-   Explain your integration needs.
-   Tallyfy will provide the credentials for your organization. Store them securely.

### 2. Obtain an application access token

Your application first needs its *own* access token to perform actions like user provisioning or getting user-specific tokens.

-   **Endpoint:** `POST /oauth/token`
-   **Base URL:** `https://go.tallyfy.com/api` (The primary API base URL).
-   **OAuth Endpoint:** `https://go.tallyfy.com/api/oauth/token` (Used specifically for getting the access token).
-   **Request Body (form-data):**
    -   `grant_type`: `client_credentials`
    -   `client_id`: Your Application's Client ID
    -   `client_secret`: Your Application's Client Secret
    -   `scope`: `*` (or specific scopes if provided by Tallyfy)

**Example (Conceptual cURL):**

```bash
curl -X POST https://go.tallyfy.com/api/oauth/token \
     -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
     -d "grant_type=client_credentials" \
     -d client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID \
     -d client_secret=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET \
     -d scope='*'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 3600, // Typically 1 hour
    "access_token": "APP_LEVEL_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXAMPLE..."
}
```

:::note[Token Expiration]
Application access tokens expire (usually after one hour). Your application must handle token refresh or request new tokens before expiration. Use the `expires_in` value to manage this.
:::

:::note[Endpoint Consistency]

-   **Base URL:** Check with Tallyfy Support if this specific endpoint uses `go.tallyfy.com/api` or just `go.tallyfy.com`. For most standard API calls *after* authentication, you'll use `https://go.tallyfy.com/api`. The OAuth token endpoint itself might be at the root or `/api` path - always verify with the official documentation or support.
-   **OAuth Endpoint:** The standard is usually `https://[base_url]/oauth/token`.

:::

### 3. (Optional) Provision users programmatically

Using the application-level token obtained in Step 2, you can manage users. *Refer to the Members code samples section for specific examples once available.* The general endpoint mentioned previously was `POST /api/applications/{orgID}/users`, but check the current Swagger definition for the correct endpoint, likely under `/organizations/{org}/users/invite` or similar, using the **application token** as the Bearer token.

### 4. (Optional) Generate user-specific access tokens

To act *as* a specific user, request a user-specific token using the application token.

-   **Endpoint:** `POST /api/applications/{orgID}/users/{email}/token` (Verify this endpoint with Tallyfy Support or Swagger spec; it might differ from standard OAuth patterns).
-   **Base URL:** Check with Tallyfy Support if this specific endpoint uses `go.tallyfy.com` or `api.tallyfy.com`.
-   **Headers:**
    -   `Authorization: Bearer {your_app_access_token}` (From Step 2)
    -   `Content-Type: application/json`
    -   `X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient`

**Response:**

```json
{
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 3600, // User token lifetime
    "access_token": "USER_SPECIFIC_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXAMPLE..."
}
```

### 5. Make API requests (as Application or User)

Use the appropriate token (`APP_LEVEL_ACCESS_TOKEN` or `USER_SPECIFIC_ACCESS_TOKEN`) in the `Authorization: Bearer {token}` header for subsequent API calls, along with the standard `Accept` and `X-Tallyfy-Client` headers.

**Example: Get tasks for a specific user (using user-specific token)**

-   **Endpoint:** `GET /organizations/{orgID}/me/tasks`
-   **Base URL:** `https://go.tallyfy.com/api`
-   **Resource Path:** e.g., `/organizations/{org_id}/users`
-   **Full URL:** `https://go.tallyfy.com/api/organizations/{org_id}/users`
-   **Headers:**
    -   `Authorization: Bearer {user_specific_access_token}`
    -   `Accept: application/json`
    -   `X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient`

*Code examples for making the requests themselves are similar to those shown in the [Personal Access Token](./personal-access-token/) guide, just substitute the correct token.*

### Security considerations

-   Store client credentials securely (e.g., encrypted secrets management).
-   Protect both application-level and user-specific tokens.
-   Rotate secrets periodically.
-   Use HTTPS for all communications.
-   Implement robust token expiration and refresh logic.
