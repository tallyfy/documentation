Guests are external users who participate in specific tasks or processes without needing a full member account. You can use the API to create, list, retrieve, update, and delete guests. Guest endpoints use the guest's **email address** (URL-encoded) as the identifier in the path, not a numeric ID.

All endpoints are scoped to your organization at `https://go.tallyfy.com/api/organizations/{org_id}/guests`.
