Processes are called "runs" in the Tallyfy API. Each process is a live, trackable instance launched from a template. These endpoints let you manage the full lifecycle - from launching a new process through to archiving or permanently deleting it.

All process endpoints are org-scoped under `/organizations/{org_id}/runs/...`.

Here is what you can do:

- **Launch a process** (`POST .../runs`) - Start a new process from a template, with optional kick-off form data and assignment overrides.
- **List processes** (`GET .../runs`) - Retrieve processes filtered by status, owner, template, tags, and more.
- **Get a process** (`GET .../runs/{run_id}`) - Fetch full details for a single process, including tasks and form fields.
- **Update a process** (`PUT .../runs/{run_id}`) - Change name, summary, owner, tags, or folders on a running process.
- **Archive a process** (`DELETE .../runs/{run_id}`) - Soft-delete a process. It disappears from default views but keeps all data intact.
- **Activate (restore) a process** (`PUT .../runs/{run_id}/activate`) - Bring an archived process back to its previous active state.
- **Permanently delete a process** (`DELETE .../runs/{run_id}/delete`) - Irreversibly remove an archived process and all its data. Admin-only, and the process must be archived first.
- **Get activity feed** (`GET .../activity-feeds`) - Pull the audit trail of task completions, comments, and status changes for a process.
- **Launch a project (no template)** (`POST .../runs`) - Create an empty process container for ad-hoc tasks without a predefined template.

Each page below has request details and code samples in multiple languages.
