title: Managing templates (blueprints)
---

## Templates in the API

Process templates (referred to as "Checklists" or "Blueprints" in the API) define the structure of your repeatable processes. While in the Tallyfy user interface these are called **Templates**, the API endpoints consistently use the term **Blueprints** to refer to the same objects.

:::note[Important Terminology Difference]
**UI Terminology**: Templates
**API Terminology**: Blueprints (or sometimes Checklists)

This distinction is important to remember when developing with the API versus using the Tallyfy interface.
:::

Use the API to create, retrieve, update, and manage these templates/blueprints. Refer to the individual pages for specific request details and code examples.
