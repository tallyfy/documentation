Groups in Tallyfy organize members (user IDs) and guests (email addresses) so you can assign them to tasks and processes together. The API supports full CRUD -- create, list, get, update, and delete groups within your organization.

All group endpoints are scoped to your organization at `https://go.tallyfy.com/api/organizations/{org_id}/groups`. Creating, updating, and deleting groups requires the `manage_groups` permission, while listing and viewing are available to any authenticated org member.

See the individual pages below for request details and code examples.
