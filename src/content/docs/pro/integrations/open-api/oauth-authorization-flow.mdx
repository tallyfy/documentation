## Implementing the OAuth authorization flow

This guide explains how to implement a standard OAuth authorization flow for third-party applications integrating with Tallyfy. This approach allows your users to authenticate directly with Tallyfy without sharing their credentials with your application.

### Requirements

- Paid Tallyfy Professional or Enterprise subscription
- Client ID and Client Secret from Tallyfy
- A registered redirect URI for your application
- Basic understanding of OAuth 2.0 authorization flows

:::caution[Enterprise Feature]
The OAuth authorization flow is only available to paid organizations. Contact Tallyfy Support to request a Client ID and Client Secret for your application.
:::

### Standard OAuth flow implementation

The following diagram shows the complete OAuth 2.0 implicit flow for authenticating third-party applications with Tallyfy.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant User
    participant App as Third-party App
    participant Auth as Tallyfy Auth<br/>(account.tallyfy.com)
    participant API as Tallyfy API
    
    Note over User,API: OAuth 2.0 Implicit Flow
    
    User->>App: Initiates login
    App->>User: Redirect to Tallyfy
    User->>Auth: GET /oauth/authorize<br/>client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID<br/>redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URL
    Auth->>User: Show login page
    User->>Auth: Enter credentials
    Auth->>Auth: Validate credentials
    Auth->>User: Redirect with token
    User->>App: YOUR_REDIRECT_URL<br/>#access_token=TOKEN<br/>&expires_in=840
    App->>App: Extract token from URL
    
    Note over App,API: Using the Access Token
    
    App->>API: API Request<br/>Authorization: Bearer TOKEN<br/>X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient
    API->>App: Response data
    
    Note over App: Token expires after<br/>specified seconds
```

**What to notice:**
- The access token is returned in the URL fragment (after #) for security - fragments are not sent to servers
- Authentication happens entirely on Tallyfy's domain, your app never sees user credentials
- The `X-Tallyfy-Client` header is required for all API calls after authentication

#### Step 1: Redirect users to Tallyfy authorization page

Direct your users to the Tallyfy authorization endpoint:

```
https://account.tallyfy.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&response_type=token&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URL
```

Replace:
- `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` with your application's client ID
- `YOUR_REDIRECT_URL` with your application's registered redirect URI

Users will see the Tallyfy login page where they can authenticate using their Tallyfy credentials.

#### Step 2: Handle the redirect with access token

After successful authentication, Tallyfy redirects the user back to your specified redirect URI with the access token in the URL fragment:

```
YOUR_REDIRECT_URL?access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN&token_type=Bearer&expires_in=EXPIRES_IN_SECONDS
```

Your application should:
1. Extract the `access_token` from the URL
2. Store it securely
3. Use it for subsequent API requests

#### Step 3: Make API requests with the access token

Use the access token in the Authorization header for all Tallyfy API requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json
X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient
```

:::note[Required Headers]
Always include the `X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient` header in all direct API calls to Tallyfy endpoints. Requests without this header will be rejected.
:::

### Example implementation

#### Example authorization URL

```
https://account.tallyfy.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=9999&response_type=token&redirect_uri=https://yourapp.com/auth/callback
```

#### Example redirect with access token

```
https://yourapp.com/auth/callback?access_token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...&token_type=Bearer&expires_in=840
```

#### Handling multi-organization users

A user in Tallyfy can belong to multiple organizations. After authentication, the access token is associated with the organization the user is currently logged into. If your application needs to work with multiple Tallyfy organizations for a user:

1. Store the organization context along with the access token
2. Consider implementing organization selection in your application
3. For users in multiple organizations, you may need to handle organization-specific authentication flows

### Security best practices

- Always use HTTPS for all OAuth-related communication
- Implement PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for added security
- Store access tokens securely, preferably encrypted
- Implement token expiration handling
- Never expose your Client Secret in client-side code
- Validate all redirect URIs against expected patterns
- Implement state parameter to prevent CSRF attacks

### Troubleshooting

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| Authorization fails | Invalid client ID | Verify your client ID |
| Redirect fails | Mismatched redirect URI | Ensure the redirect URI matches exactly with the registered one |
| Token doesn't work | Token expired | Check expiration time and request a new token |
| Organization context issues | User belongs to multiple organizations | Clarify organization context during authentication |

For any issues with the OAuth implementation, contact Tallyfy Support with detailed information about the error and your implementation.
