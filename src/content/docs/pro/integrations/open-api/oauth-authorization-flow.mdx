## OAuth implicit grant flow for third-party apps

Tallyfy uses the OAuth 2.0 implicit grant[^1] flow for third-party application authentication. Your users log in directly on Tallyfy's domain, and an access token comes back in the URL fragment - your app never touches their credentials.

### Requirements

- Paid Tallyfy Pro or Enterprise subscription
- Client ID from Tallyfy (contact support)
- A registered redirect URI for your application

:::caution[Paid feature]
The OAuth authorization flow is only available to paid organizations. Contact Tallyfy Support to get a Client ID for your application.
:::

### How the flow works

Here's the complete OAuth 2.0 implicit flow for authenticating third-party applications with Tallyfy.

**Diagram description:** OAuth 2.0 implicit flow showing the 11-step authentication process where users log in directly with Tallyfy and receive an access token via URL fragment, which the third-party app extracts for Bearer-authenticated API requests.

**What to notice:**
- The access token is returned in the URL fragment (after `#`) - fragments aren't sent to servers, which adds a layer of protection
- Authentication happens entirely on Tallyfy's domain, so your app never sees user credentials
- The `X-Tallyfy-Client` header is required for all API calls after authentication

#### Step 1 - Redirect users to Tallyfy's authorization page

Direct your users to the Tallyfy authorization endpoint:

```
https://account.tallyfy.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&response_type=token&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URL
```

Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` with your application's client ID and `YOUR_REDIRECT_URL` with your registered redirect URI. Users must have a verified email to proceed - they'll see Tallyfy's login page where they authenticate with their own credentials.

#### Step 2 - Handle the redirect with the access token

After successful authentication, Tallyfy redirects back to your redirect URI with the access token in the URL **fragment** (after `#`, not `?`):

```
YOUR_REDIRECT_URL#access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN&token_type=Bearer&expires_in=EXPIRES_IN_SECONDS
```

Your application should:
1. Extract the `access_token` from the URL fragment using client-side JavaScript
2. Store it securely
3. Use it for subsequent API requests

:::note[Token lifetime]
Implicit grant tokens are valid for 6 months. Plan your token refresh strategy accordingly.
:::

#### Step 3 - Make API requests with the access token

Include the access token in the Authorization header for all Tallyfy API requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN
Content-Type: application/json
X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient
```

:::note[Required headers]
Always include `X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient` in all API calls. Requests without this header will be rejected.
:::

### Example implementation

#### Example authorization URL

```
https://account.tallyfy.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=9999&response_type=token&redirect_uri=https://yourapp.com/auth/callback
```

#### Example redirect with access token

```
https://yourapp.com/auth/callback#access_token=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIs...&token_type=Bearer&expires_in=15778800
```

#### Handling multi-organization users

A Tallyfy user can belong to multiple organizations. After authentication, the access token is tied to whichever organization the user is logged into at the time. If your app needs to work across multiple Tallyfy organizations:

1. Store the organization context alongside the access token
2. Consider adding organization selection in your application
3. You may need separate authentication flows per organization

### Security best practices

- Always use HTTPS for all OAuth-related communication
- Store access tokens securely and encrypted at rest
- Monitor token expiration and prompt re-authentication before tokens expire
- Validate all redirect URIs against expected patterns

### Troubleshooting

| Issue | Possible cause | Solution |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| Authorization fails | Invalid client ID | Verify your client ID with Tallyfy Support |
| Redirect fails | Mismatched redirect URI | The redirect URI must match exactly what's registered |
| Token doesn't work | Token expired or user email unverified | Check expiration and ensure the user has verified their email |
| Organization context issues | User belongs to multiple organizations | Clarify organization context during authentication |

For any issues with your OAuth implementation, contact Tallyfy Support with details about the error and your setup.
