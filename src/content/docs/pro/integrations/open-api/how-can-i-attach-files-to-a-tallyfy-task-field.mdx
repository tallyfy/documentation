## Attaching Files to Task Fields via API

This guide explains how to programmatically attach files to Tallyfy task fields using the API. The process supports both uploading new files and linking to externally hosted files.

:::note[API Documentation]
For complete API reference, visit the [Tallyfy API documentation](https://go.tallyfy.com/api/)
:::

### Prerequisites

- Your Tallyfy API authentication token
- Organization ID, Run ID, and Task ID
- The field ID for the attachment field
- API client (Postman, cURL, or other HTTP client)

### Required HTTP Headers

All API requests must include these headers:

- `Authorization: Bearer your_token_here`
- `X-Tallyfy-Client: APIClient` (critical - requests without this header will be rejected)
- `Content-Type: application/json` (for PUT requests with JSON body)

### Method 1: Upload and Attach Local Files

This method involves a two-step process: first uploading the file to Tallyfy storage, then attaching it to the task field.

#### Step 1: Upload the file

Make a POST request to:
```
https://api.tallyfy.com/organizations/{your-organization-id}/file
```

Use form-data (`multipart/form-data`) with the following fields:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| name | Your file (binary data) |
| uploaded_from | Your Organization ID |
| subject_type | Run |
| step_id | Step ID |
| checklist_id | Checklist ID |
| subject_id | Run ID |

#### Step 2: Attach the uploaded file to the task field

After receiving the file data response, make a PUT request to:
```
https://api.tallyfy.com/organizations/{your-organization-id}/runs/{run-id}/tasks/{task-id}
```

With this JSON payload:
```json
{
  "taskdata": {
    "{field_id}": [
      {fileData.data}
    ]
  }
}
```

Replace `{field_id}` with your actual field ID and `{fileData.data}` with the file data object received from the upload response.

### Method 2: Link to External Files

For files already hosted elsewhere, you can directly reference them in a single API call.

Make a PUT request to:
```
https://api.tallyfy.com/organizations/{your-organization-id}/runs/{run-id}/tasks/{task-id}
```

With this JSON payload:
```json
{
  "taskdata": {
    "{field_id}": [
      {
        "filename": "example_document.pdf",
        "source": "url",
        "subject": {
          "id": "{run_id}",
          "type": "Run"
        },
        "uploaded_from": "{organization_id}",
        "url": "https://example.com/path/to/your/file.pdf"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Replace all placeholder values with your actual data.

### Response Handling

A successful response will return HTTP status code 200 and include the updated task data. Verify that the attachment field now contains the file reference.

### Troubleshooting

- **401 Unauthorized**: Check your authentication token
- **403 Forbidden**: Verify you've included the `X-Tallyfy-Client` header
- **404 Not Found**: Confirm the organization ID, run ID, and task ID are correct
- **400 Bad Request**: Review your JSON payload structure for errors
