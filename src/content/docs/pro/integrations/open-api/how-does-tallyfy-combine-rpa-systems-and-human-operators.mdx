title: Combining RPA systems and human operators

## Connecting RPA bots with human workflows

RPA tools like UiPath, Automation Anywhere, and Blue Prism handle repetitive, rule-based tasks well - but most real processes also need human judgment. Tallyfy bridges that gap by managing both automated and human tasks in one workflow through its API.

### Why this is hard without Tallyfy

When RPA bots and people work in separate systems, you run into problems:

- **Fragmented processes** - automated and manual steps live in different tools
- **No unified visibility** - you can't see the full process status in one place
- **Broken handoffs** - managing transitions between bots and humans is messy
- **Unclear accountability** - nobody knows who's responsible for what

### How Tallyfy solves this

Tallyfy acts as the coordination layer that:

1. **Manages the full process** - both automated and human tasks in a single workflow
2. **Shows everything in one view** - status of both RPA and human activities
3. **Handles handoffs** - transitions work between systems and people automatically
4. **Tracks responsibility** - clear accountability throughout the process

### How it works in practice

A typical setup looks like this:

- RPA bots execute automated tasks and call the Tallyfy API to report status
- Tallyfy's API manages process flow, creates tasks, and routes assignments
- Human operators complete tasks that need judgment or decisions
- API calls keep everything in sync between all systems

### RPA and human task flow

This diagram shows how RPA systems, Tallyfy's API, and human operators interact during process execution.

**What to notice:**
- **Automatic handoffs** - work transitions between RPA bots and human operators through Tallyfy's API
- **Exception handling** - when RPA hits issues, Tallyfy escalates to human operators for resolution before resuming automation
- **Full visibility** - every action from both automated and human activities is tracked in real-time through the Tallyfy UI

### Example: employee onboarding

Here's how Tallyfy coordinates an employee onboarding process that mixes RPA and human tasks:

- RPA handles structured tasks like system access provisioning
- Human operators manage judgment-based activities like document review
- Tallyfy tracks status across both automated and manual steps
- The entire process stays visible in a single interface

### Why this matters

This approach gives you:

- **Faster processes** - automate what you can while keeping quality on human tasks
- **Fewer errors** - bots handle repetitive work consistently
- **Full visibility** - see everything across all activities in one place
- **Easier adoption** - Tallyfy's interface is built for business teams, not just developers
- **Flexibility** - change process flows without rebuilding integrations
