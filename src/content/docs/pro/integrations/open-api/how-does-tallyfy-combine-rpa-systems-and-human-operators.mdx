## Integrating RPA Systems with Human Workflows

Robotic Process Automation (RPA) excels at automating repetitive, rule-based tasks, but many business processes require a combination of automated and human-driven activities. Tallyfy provides the orchestration layer that connects RPA systems with human workflows, creating comprehensive end-to-end process automation.

### The human-RPA integration challenge

RPA platforms like UiPath, Automation Anywhere, and Blue Prism effectively automate predictable, structured tasks. However, most business processes contain elements that require human judgment, decision-making, or exception handling. This creates several challenges:

- **Process fragmentation** - Automated and manual steps exist in separate systems
- **Visibility gaps** - Limited insight into the complete process status
- **Coordination issues** - Difficulty managing handoffs between bots and humans
- **Accountability concerns** - Unclear responsibility for process outcomes

### Tallyfy as the orchestration layer

Tallyfy addresses these challenges by providing a unified platform that:

1. **Coordinates the entire process** - Manages both automated and human tasks in a single workflow
2. **Provides end-to-end visibility** - Shows status of both RPA and human activities
3. **Facilitates effective handoffs** - Transitions work between systems and people
4. **Maintains accountability** - Tracks responsibility throughout the entire process

### Implementation architecture

The typical integration architecture includes:

- RPA bots executing automated tasks
- Tallyfy API managing the process flow and task assignments
- Human operators completing tasks requiring judgment
- API-based communication between all systems

### How RPA and human tasks flow together

This diagram shows the real-time interaction between RPA systems, Tallyfy's orchestration layer, and human operators during process execution.

# Employee Onboarding Process Example

API -> RPA: "1. Trigger automated task\n(System access provisioning)"
RPA -> RPA: "2. Execute bot workflow"
RPA -> API: "3. Task completed + Output data"
API -> UI: "4. Update process status"

API -> Human: "5. Assign manual task\n(Document review)"
Human -> UI: "6. View task details"
Human -> Human: "7. Review & make decision"
Human -> API: "8. Complete task + Decision data"
API -> UI: "9. Update process status"

# Exception handling branch
Exception Flow: {
  shape: rectangle
  style.stroke-dash: 3
  RPA -> API: "10. Report exception"
  API -> Human: "11. Escalate for handling"
  Human -> API: "12. Resolve exception"
  API -> RPA: "13. Resume automation"
}

# Note: Maintains complete audit trail
API -> UI: "14. Process completed\nFull visibility maintained"
```

**What to notice:**
- **Seamless handoffs** - Work transitions automatically between RPA bots and human operators through Tallyfy's API orchestration
- **Exception handling** - When RPA encounters issues, Tallyfy automatically escalates to human operators for resolution before resuming automation
- **Complete visibility** - Every action from both automated and human activities is tracked in real-time through the Tallyfy UI

### Example: Employee Onboarding Process

The following screenshot shows how Tallyfy orchestrates an employee onboarding process that combines RPA and human tasks:

![Tallyfy RPA integration example](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/file-m7RnDzI1Ry.png)

In this example:
- RPA handles structured tasks like system access provisioning (marked with automation icons)
- Human operators manage judgment-based activities like document review
- Tallyfy tracks status across both automated and manual steps
- The entire process remains visible in a single Tallyfy interface

### Business benefits

This integrated approach delivers advantages:

- **Process acceleration** - Automation of appropriate tasks while maintaining quality
- **Error reduction** - Consistent execution of repetitive activities
- **Enhanced visibility** - Complete process transparency across all activities
- **Improved adoption** - User-friendly interface for business teams
- **Greater flexibility** - Modification of process flows without technical debt
