## What are Tallyfy webhooks and how do they work?

Webhooks send structured JSON messages from Tallyfy to external systems whenever specific events happen in your workflows. They're automatic - no polling required.

When a task gets completed, a process launches, or a status changes, Tallyfy fires an HTTP POST request to a URL you specify. The receiving system gets the data instantly and can act on it.

:::tip[Webhooks = Automatic doorbell]
Think of a webhook like an **automatic doorbell** for your other software:

- A specific **event occurs** in Tallyfy (like a task is completed - someone **presses the doorbell**).
- Tallyfy instantly sends a **notification** (the webhook message, with details about the event) to a web address (URL) you specify.
- The other system listening at that address (**hearing the doorbell**) receives the message immediately.

No constant checking needed - the notification comes to you.
:::

Any system that can receive HTTP POST requests can receive Tallyfy webhooks.

### Key benefits

- **Instant data delivery** - Get event details the moment something happens in a Tallyfy workflow.
- **Standard JSON format** - Works with any system that understands JSON.
- **Universal compatibility** - Any HTTP-capable system can be a webhook destination.
- **Automatic triggers** - Start workflows or actions in external systems based on specific Tallyfy events, with no manual steps.

### Where can you send Tallyfy webhooks?

Webhooks can go to several types of destinations:

- **Middleware platforms** (Zapier, Make, Power Automate) - route data to other apps without coding.
- **Custom APIs and applications** - your own endpoints built for specific business logic.
- **Serverless functions** (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions) - event-driven processing without managing servers.
- **RPA bots** (Robotic Process Automation) - automate actions in legacy systems that don't have modern APIs.

:::note[Choosing how to use webhooks]
Sending webhooks to middleware (Zapier, Make, etc.) is the easiest way to connect Tallyfy events to other apps without coding. Building your own webhook receiver gives you more control but requires development resources.
:::

:::note[Considering integration alternatives]
While Zapier works for simple connections, we generally recommend more capable and cost-effective middleware like **n8n**, **Make**, or **Microsoft Power Automate** for serious integrations.

For maximum control, especially if you have development resources, consider using Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) to build custom integrations that use AI to generate code for serverless functions.
