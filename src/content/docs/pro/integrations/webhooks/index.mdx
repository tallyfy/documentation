## Using Webhooks for Real-Time Updates

Webhooks are automatic messages containing data (in JSON format) that Tallyfy sends out to other systems *when something specific happens* in Tallyfy (like a task being completed or a process starting).

:::tip[Webhooks = Automatic Doorbell/Notification]
Think of a webhook like an **automatic doorbell** for your other software:

- When a specific **event occurs** in Tallyfy (like a task is completed - someone **presses the doorbell**),
- Tallyfy instantly sends a **notification** (the webhook message, with details about the event) to a web address (URL) you specify.
- The other system listening at that address (**hearing the doorbell**) receives the message immediately.

This allows other systems to react in real-time to things happening in Tallyfy, without needing to constantly check for updates.
:::

Any system that can receive standard web requests (HTTP POST) can receive Tallyfy webhooks.

### Why use webhooks?

- **Get data instantly**: Receive information the moment an event happens in Tallyfy.
- **Standard format**: Webhooks always use the common JSON data format.
- **Works with anything**: Connect to almost any other system capable of receiving web requests.
- **Trigger other actions**: Start workflows or actions in other systems automatically based on Tallyfy events.

### Common tools that receive webhooks

Webhooks are often sent to:
- Middleware platforms (like Zapier, Make, Power Automate) which then pass the data to other apps.
- Custom code or APIs you build.
- Serverless functions (like AWS Lambda or Azure Functions).
- RPA bots (Robotic Process Automation).

:::note[Choosing How to Use Webhooks]
Sending webhooks to middleware (Zapier, Make, etc.) is usually the easiest way to connect Tallyfy events to other apps without coding. Building your own custom webhook receiver gives you the most control but requires development resources.
:::

- Integration middleware platforms (Zapier, Power Automate, Make.com)
- Custom API endpoints
- Serverless functions (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions)
- RPA (Robotic Process Automation) solutions
- Custom scripts or applications

:::note[Considering Integration Alternatives]
While Zapier can be useful for simple connections, we generally recommend more capable and cost-effective middleware solutions like **n8n**, **Make**, or **Microsoft Power Automate** for serious integrations.

For maximum control and flexibility, especially if you have development resources, consider using Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) to build custom integrations, potentially leveraging AI to generate code for serverless functions.
