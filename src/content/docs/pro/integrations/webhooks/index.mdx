## How to enable real-time communication with external systems

Webhooks are JSON data packets that Tallyfy sends when specific events occur within the system.

:::tip[Webhooks: Like an Automatic Doorbell or Notification]
Imagine a webhook as an **automatic doorbell** for your business processes.

- When a specific **event happens** in Tallyfy (e.g., a process is launched, a task is completed – like someone **pressing the doorbell**),
- Tallyfy instantly sends out an **automated notification** (the webhook, containing details about the event) to another system you've connected (e.g., your CRM, a spreadsheet, an email tool – the **person hearing the doorbell**).

That other system receives the notification in real-time and can then automatically take action based on the event (like updating a record or sending a message). It's Tallyfy proactively telling other systems, "Hey, something important just happened!" the moment it occurs.
:::

These packets follow standard web protocols and can be received by any internet-accessible endpoint you configure. Webhooks provide a reliable mechanism for real-time data exchange between Tallyfy and external systems.

### Key benefits of webhooks

- **Real-time data transmission** - Receive data instantly when events occur
- **Standardized format** - All webhooks use consistent JSON formatting
- **System-agnostic integration** - Compatible with any system that can receive HTTP requests
- **Event-driven automation** - Trigger external processes based on Tallyfy events

### Common webhook receivers

- Integration middleware platforms (Zapier, Power Automate, Make.com)
- Custom API endpoints
- Serverless functions (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions)
- RPA (Robotic Process Automation) solutions
- Custom scripts or applications

:::note[Considering Integration Alternatives]
While Zapier can be useful for simple connections, we generally recommend more robust and cost-effective middleware solutions like **n8n**, **Make**, or **Microsoft Power Automate** for serious integrations.

For maximum control and flexibility, especially if you have development resources, consider using Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) to build custom integrations, potentially leveraging AI to generate code for serverless functions.
