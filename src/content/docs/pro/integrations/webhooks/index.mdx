## How do Tallyfy webhooks enable real-time system integration and automation?

Webhooks give you automatic, real-time data transmission that sends structured JSON messages from Tallyfy to external systems whenever specific events happen in your workflows.

These smart automated notifications eliminate the need for constant system polling while letting you respond immediately to critical workflow events like task completions, process launches, or status changes.

Webhooks transform Tallyfy from an isolated workflow system into a reactive automation hub that triggers actions across your entire technology ecosystem.

:::tip[Webhooks = Automatic Doorbell/Notification]
Think of a webhook like an **automatic doorbell** for your other software:

- When a specific **event occurs** in Tallyfy (like a task is completed - someone **presses the doorbell**),
- Tallyfy instantly sends a **notification** (the webhook message, with details about the event) to a web address (URL) you specify.
- The other system listening at that address (**hearing the doorbell**) receives the message immediately.

This allows other systems to react in real-time to things happening in Tallyfy, without needing to constantly check for updates.
:::

Any system that can receive standard web requests (HTTP POST) can receive Tallyfy webhooks.

### What advantages do Tallyfy webhooks provide for business automation?

- **Instant data delivery**: Get complete information right away when events happen in Tallyfy workflows for real-time responses.
- **Standardized format**: Webhooks always use industry-standard JSON format so they work with any system.
- **Universal compatibility**: Connect easily to virtually any system that can receive HTTP web requests for maximum flexibility.
- **Automated action triggering**: Start workflows or actions in external systems automatically based on specific Tallyfy events for complete automation.

These advantages let you create responsive, connected systems that react smartly to workflow events.

### What systems commonly receive Tallyfy webhooks for integration?

Webhooks are commonly sent to different types of systems:
- **Middleware platforms** (like Zapier, Make, Power Automate) that smartly route data to other apps for multi-system coordination.
- **Custom APIs and applications** that you build for specific business needs and specialized processing.
- **Serverless functions** (like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions) for scalable, event-driven processing without managing infrastructure.
- **RPA bots** (Robotic Process Automation) for automated task execution in legacy systems that lack modern APIs.

This flexibility means webhooks can work with virtually any business system setup.

:::note[Choosing How to Use Webhooks]
Sending webhooks to middleware (Zapier, Make, etc.) is usually the easiest way to connect Tallyfy events to other apps without coding. Building your own custom webhook receiver gives you the most control but requires development resources.

#### Primary webhook destination categories:
- **Integration middleware platforms** (Zapier, Power Automate, Make.com) for connecting systems
- **Custom API endpoints** for customized business logic
- **Serverless functions** (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions) for scalable event processing
- **RPA solutions** (Robotic Process Automation) for automating legacy system interactions
- **Custom scripts and applications** for specialized business needs

:::note[Considering Integration Alternatives]
While Zapier can be useful for simple connections, we generally recommend more capable and cost-effective middleware solutions like **n8n**, **Make**, or **Microsoft Power Automate** for serious integrations.

For maximum control and flexibility, especially if you have development resources, consider using Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) to build custom integrations that leverage AI to generate code for serverless functions.
