## Webhooks in Tallyfy

Webhooks are JSON packets that emit when certain events happen within Tallyfy.

They are future-proof, agnostic and open in terms of the specification and delivery mechanism over the internet.

Any system on the web can "catch" webhooks emitted by Talyfy - whether that's middleware systems, serverless functions or other types of listeners like scripts or RPA bots.

You can learn how to set up Tallyfy to emit webhooks here:


import PageTree from '@/components/PageTree.astro';

<PageTree />

import { CardGrid, LinkTitleCard} from "~/components";
