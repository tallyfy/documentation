## How do Tallyfy webhooks enable real-time system integration and automation?

Webhooks provide sophisticated automatic, real-time data transmission capabilities that send structured JSON messages from Tallyfy to external systems whenever specific events occur within your organizational workflows.

These intelligent automated notifications eliminate the inefficiency of constant system polling while enabling immediate, event-driven responses to critical workflow events such as task completions, process launches, or status changes.

Webhooks transform Tallyfy from an isolated workflow system into a reactive automation hub that triggers actions across your entire technology ecosystem.

:::tip[Webhooks = Automatic Doorbell/Notification]
Think of a webhook like an **automatic doorbell** for your other software:

- When a specific **event occurs** in Tallyfy (like a task is completed - someone **presses the doorbell**),
- Tallyfy instantly sends a **notification** (the webhook message, with details about the event) to a web address (URL) you specify.
- The other system listening at that address (**hearing the doorbell**) receives the message immediately.

This allows other systems to react in real-time to things happening in Tallyfy, without needing to constantly check for updates.
:::

Any system that can receive standard web requests (HTTP POST) can receive Tallyfy webhooks.

### What advantages do Tallyfy webhooks provide for business automation?

- **Instant data delivery**: Receive comprehensive information immediately when events occur in Tallyfy workflows for real-time responsiveness.
- **Standardized format**: Webhooks consistently use industry-standard JSON data format for universal compatibility across systems.
- **Universal compatibility**: Connect seamlessly to virtually any system capable of receiving HTTP web requests for maximum flexibility.
- **Automated action triggering**: Initiate sophisticated workflows or actions in external systems automatically based on specific Tallyfy events for comprehensive automation.

These advantages enable organizations to create responsive, interconnected systems that react intelligently to workflow events.

### What systems commonly receive Tallyfy webhooks for integration?

Webhooks are frequently transmitted to diverse system types:
- **Middleware platforms** (such as Zapier, Make, Power Automate) which intelligently route data to downstream applications for multi-system orchestration.
- **Custom APIs and applications** that you develop for specific business requirements and specialized processing.
- **Serverless functions** (including AWS Lambda, Azure Functions) for scalable, event-driven processing without infrastructure management.
- **RPA bots** (Robotic Process Automation) for automated task execution in legacy systems that lack modern APIs.

This flexibility ensures webhooks can integrate with virtually any business system architecture.

:::note[Choosing How to Use Webhooks]
Sending webhooks to middleware (Zapier, Make, etc.) is usually the easiest way to connect Tallyfy events to other apps without coding. Building your own custom webhook receiver gives you the most control but requires development resources.
:::

#### Primary webhook destination categories:
- **Integration middleware platforms** (Zapier, Power Automate, Make.com) for cross-system orchestration
- **Custom API endpoints** for tailored business logic implementation
- **Serverless computing functions** (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions) for scalable event processing
- **RPA solutions** (Robotic Process Automation) for automated legacy system interaction
- **Custom scripts and applications** for specialized organizational requirements

:::note[Considering Integration Alternatives]
While Zapier can be useful for simple connections, we generally recommend more capable and cost-effective middleware solutions like **n8n**, **Make**, or **Microsoft Power Automate** for serious integrations.

For maximum control and flexibility, especially if you have development resources, consider using Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) to build custom integrations, potentially leveraging AI to generate code for serverless functions.
