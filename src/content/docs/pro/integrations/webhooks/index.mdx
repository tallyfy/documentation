## Webhooks in Tallyfy

Webhooks are JSON data packets that Tallyfy sends when specific events occur within the system. 

These packets follow standard web protocols and can be received by any internet-accessible endpoint you configure. Webhooks provide a reliable mechanism for real-time data exchange between Tallyfy and external systems.

### Key benefits of webhooks:

- **Real-time data transmission** - Receive data instantly when events occur
- **Standardized format** - All webhooks use consistent JSON formatting
- **System-agnostic integration** - Compatible with any system that can receive HTTP requests
- **Event-driven automation** - Trigger external processes based on Tallyfy events

### Common webhook receivers:

- Integration middleware platforms (Zapier, Power Automate, Make.com)
- Custom API endpoints
- Serverless functions (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions)
- RPA (Robotic Process Automation) solutions
- Custom scripts or applications

For detailed implementation instructions, see the articles linked below.
