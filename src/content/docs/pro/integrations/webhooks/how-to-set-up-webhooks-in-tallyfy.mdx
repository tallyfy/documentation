## Webhook Configuration Guide

Webhooks are automated messages sent from Tallyfy to external systems when specific events occur. They transmit JSON data packets to predefined URLs, enabling real-time integration with other applications without manual intervention. This guide explains how to configure and implement webhooks in Tallyfy.

### Understanding webhook types

Tallyfy offers two webhook configuration levels:

#### Template-level webhooks

Template-level webhooks trigger when **any step** within a process is completed. They also trigger when a process is initially launched, before any tasks are even completed. They transmit the complete process data, including all form fields and step statuses.

**Use cases:**
- Track overall process progress in external systems
- Update dashboards when any step changes
- Trigger comprehensive data exports
- Capture new process launches in external systems

#### Step-level webhooks

Step-level webhooks trigger when a **specific step** is completed. They provide targeted integration for individual tasks within a process.

**Use cases:**
- Send notifications at critical process milestones
- Trigger follow-up actions in other systems
- Export specific form field data collected at a particular step

### Configuring template-level webhooks

<Steps>
1. Navigate to the template you want to configure
2. Click **Edit** to enter template editing mode
3. Open the **Advanced Settings** drawer
4. Locate the Webhooks section
5. Toggle webhook functionality on
6. Enter the destination URL in the **Template webhook URL** field
7. Note the **Template alias** for reference in your integration
</Steps>

### Configuring step-level webhooks

<Steps>
1. Navigate to the template containing your target step
2. Click **Edit** to enter template editing mode
3. Select the specific step that should trigger the webhook
4. Open the **Advanced** tab
5. Toggle webhook functionality on
6. Enter the destination URL in the webhook URL field
7. Save your changes
</Steps>

### Implementation example: Slack notifications

This example demonstrates how to send automated notifications to a Slack channel when an employee completes an onboarding process in Tallyfy.

#### Requirements

- Tallyfy account with Professional or Enterprise plan
- Zapier account (or alternative middleware like Make.com or Power Automate)
- Slack workspace with administrative access

:::note[Considering Integration Alternatives]
While Zapier can be useful for simple connections, we generally recommend more capable and cost-effective middleware solutions like **n8n**, **Make**, or **Microsoft Power Automate** for serious integrations.

For maximum control and flexibility, especially if you have development resources, consider using Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) to build custom integrations, potentially leveraging AI to generate code for serverless functions.

#### Step 1: Configure Zapier webhook receiver

<Steps>
1. Sign in to your Zapier account
2. Create a new Zap
3. Select **Webhooks by Zapier** as the trigger app
4. Choose **Catch Hook** as the trigger event

5. Copy the custom webhook URL provided by Zapier (you'll need this for Tallyfy)

</Steps>

#### Step 2: Configure Slack message action

<Steps>
1. Add an action step to your Zap.
2. Select **Slack** as the action app.
3. Choose **Send Channel Message** as the action event.

4. Connect your Slack account if not already connected.
5. Select the destination channel (e.g., #general).
6. Create a message template using webhook data.

7. Include relevant details like process name, step name, and assignee in the template.
</Steps>

#### Step 3: Configure Tallyfy webhook

<Steps>
1. Navigate to your onboarding template in Tallyfy.
2. Enter **Edit** mode.
3. For template-level notifications, open the **Advanced Settings** drawer.
4. Toggle webhooks on within the Advanced Settings.
5. Paste the Zapier webhook URL into the **Template webhook URL** field.
6. For step-specific notifications, select the final onboarding step.
7. Open the **Advanced** tab for that step.
8. Toggle webhooks on within the step's Advanced tab.
9. Paste the Zapier webhook URL into the step's webhook field.
10. Save your changes.
</Steps>

#### Step 4: Test the integration

<Steps>
1. Run your onboarding process
2. Complete the relevant step
3. Verify that the notification appears in your Slack channel

### Security considerations

For webhook security, Tallyfy includes the `X-Tallyfy-OrgID` header in all webhook requests. You can use this header to verify that incoming webhooks are legitimate by checking against your organization's ID.

:::warning[Important: Handle duplicate webhook events]
Webhooks can fire multiple times for the same event. For example, when a task is completed and then reopened and completed again, you'll receive multiple webhook notifications. Always implement [idempotency handling](/products/pro/integrations/handling-idempotency-in-webhooks-and-api/) to prevent duplicate actions in your integrated systems.
:::

### Best practices

- Use HTTPS URLs for webhook destinations
- Implement webhook authentication in your receiving system
- Test webhooks thoroughly before relying on them in production
- Monitor webhook delivery using your middleware platform's logging tools
- Consider implementing retry logic for failed webhook deliveries
