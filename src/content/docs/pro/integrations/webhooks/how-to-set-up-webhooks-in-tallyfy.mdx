## Webhook Configuration Guide

Tallyfy webhooks are automated messages sent to external systems when specific events occur in your workflows. They transmit JSON data packets to predefined URLs, enabling real-time integration with other applications without manual intervention. This guide explains how to configure and implement webhooks in Tallyfy and avoid the common pitfalls that trip people up.

### Understanding webhook types

Tallyfy offers two webhook configuration levels:

#### Template-level webhooks

Template-level webhooks trigger when **any step** within a process is completed. They also trigger when a process is initially launched, before any tasks are even completed. They transmit the complete process data, including all form fields and step statuses. Think of these as the "firehose" option - you get everything.

**Use cases:**
- Track overall process progress in external systems
- Update dashboards when any step changes
- Trigger comprehensive data exports
- Capture new process launches in external systems

#### Step-level webhooks

Step-level webhooks trigger when a **specific step** is completed. They provide targeted integration for individual tasks within a process. These are more surgical - only fire when that particular step is done.

**Use cases:**
- Send notifications at critical process milestones
- Trigger follow-up actions in other systems
- Export specific form field data collected at a particular step

### How webhook events flow

This diagram shows how Tallyfy sends webhook data to external systems when events occur in your workflows.

```

**What to notice:**
- **Two trigger types**: Template-level webhooks fire on ANY step completion or process launch, while step-level webhooks only fire for specific steps
- **Retry mechanism**: Failed webhook deliveries automatically retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff (1 minute, 5 minutes, 15 minutes) to handle temporary network issues
- **Security validation**: The X-Tallyfy-OrgID header authenticates webhook requests - always validate this in your middleware to prevent processing unauthorized webhooks

### Configuring template-level webhooks

<Steps>
1. Navigate to the template you want to configure
2. Click **Edit** to enter template editing mode
3. Open the **Advanced Settings** drawer
4. Locate the Webhooks section
5. Toggle webhook functionality on
6. Enter the destination URL in the **Template webhook URL** field
7. Note the **Template alias** for reference in your integration
</Steps>

### Configuring step-level webhooks

<Steps>
1. Navigate to the template containing your target step
2. Click **Edit** to enter template editing mode
3. Select the specific step that should trigger the webhook
4. Open the **Advanced** tab
5. Toggle webhook functionality on
6. Enter the destination URL in the webhook URL field
7. Save your changes
</Steps>

### Implementation example: Slack notifications

This example demonstrates how to send automated notifications to a Slack channel when an employee completes an onboarding process in Tallyfy.

#### Requirements

- Tallyfy account with Professional or Enterprise plan
- Middleware account (such as Make.com, Power Automate, n8n, or Zapier)
- Slack workspace with administrative access

:::note[Choosing the Right Middleware]
For production integrations, we recommend comparing different [middleware platforms](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) based on your needs. Popular options include **n8n**, **Make**, **Microsoft Power Automate**, and Zapier - each with different pricing models and capabilities.

For maximum control and flexibility, especially if you have development resources, consider using Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) to build custom integrations that leverage AI to generate code for serverless functions.
:::

#### Step 1: Configure middleware webhook receiver

<Steps>
1. Sign in to your middleware platform account
2. Create a new workflow (called "Zap" in Zapier, "Flow" in Power Automate, "Scenario" in Make)
3. Select **Webhooks** as the trigger app
4. Choose **Catch Hook** or **When HTTP request is received** as the trigger event

    ![Zapier Catch Hook trigger](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy/pro/webhooks-zapier-catch-hook-trigger.png)

5. Copy the custom webhook URL provided by your middleware platform (you'll need this for Tallyfy)

    ![Zapier webhook URL](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy/pro/webhooks-zapier-webhook-url.png)
</Steps>

#### Step 2: Configure Slack message action

<Steps>
1. Add an action step to your workflow.
2. Select **Slack** as the action app.
3. Choose **Send Channel Message** as the action event.

    ![Zapier Slack action](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy/pro/webhooks-zapier-slack-action.png)

4. Connect your Slack account if not already connected.
5. Select the destination channel (e.g., #general).
6. Create a message template using webhook data.

    ![Slack message template](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy/pro/webhooks-zapier-slack-message-template.png)
7. Include relevant details like process name, step name, and assignee in the template.
</Steps>

#### Step 3: Configure Tallyfy webhook

<Steps>
1. Navigate to your onboarding template in Tallyfy.
2. Enter **Edit** mode.
3. For template-level notifications, open the **Advanced Settings** drawer.
4. Toggle webhooks on within the Advanced Settings.
5. Paste the middleware webhook URL into the **Template webhook URL** field.
6. For step-specific notifications, select the final onboarding step.
7. Open the **Advanced** tab for that step.
8. Toggle webhooks on within the step's Advanced tab.
9. Paste the middleware webhook URL into the step's webhook field.
10. Save your changes.
</Steps>

#### Step 4: Test the integration

<Steps>
1. Run your onboarding process
2. Complete the relevant step
3. Verify that the notification appears in your Slack channel

</Steps>

### Security considerations

For webhook security, Tallyfy includes the `X-Tallyfy-OrgID` header in all webhook requests. You can use this header to verify that incoming webhooks are legitimate by checking against your organization's ID - you definitely don't want to process random webhook spam.

![X-Tallyfy-OrgID header](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy/pro/webhooks-x-tallyfy-orgid-header.png)

:::warning[Important: Handle duplicate webhook events]
Webhooks can fire multiple times for the same event. For example, when a task is completed and then reopened and completed again, you'll receive multiple webhook notifications. Always implement [idempotency handling](/products/pro/integrations/handling-idempotency-in-webhooks-and-api/) to prevent duplicate actions in your integrated systems. Handling duplicates from the start is much easier than debugging why things ran twice later.
:::

### Troubleshooting webhook issues

**Webhooks not firing?** Here's how to diagnose:

1. **Verify the URL is correct** - Copy and paste it fresh, don't type it
2. **Check URL accessibility** - Test your webhook URL with a tool like RequestBin or Postman first
3. **Confirm webhook is enabled** - Both the toggle AND the URL field must be set
4. **Test with a simple receiver** - Use webhook.site or RequestBin to verify Tallyfy is sending data
5. **Check for HTTPS** - Many webhook receivers require HTTPS, not HTTP
6. **Look for authentication requirements** - Your receiver might be rejecting unauthenticated requests
7. **Verify process completion** - Webhooks only fire when steps are actually completed
8. **Check retry attempts** - Look for delayed delivery (1, 5, 15 minutes after initial failure)

:::tip[Testing webhooks]
**Always test with webhook.site first**. Go to webhook.site, get a unique URL, use it in Tallyfy, then complete a task. You'll see exactly what data Tallyfy sends. Once you confirm data is flowing, switch to your real webhook URL.
:::

### Best practices

- Use HTTPS URLs for webhook destinations (HTTP is asking for trouble)
- Implement webhook authentication in your receiving system
- Test webhooks thoroughly before relying on them in production (seriously, test them)
- Monitor webhook delivery using your middleware platform's logging tools
- Consider implementing retry logic for failed webhook deliveries
- Use webhook.site or RequestBin for initial testing before connecting to production systems
- Always validate the payload structure - external systems change without warning
