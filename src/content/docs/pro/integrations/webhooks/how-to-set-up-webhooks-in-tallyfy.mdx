## Webhook Configuration Guide

Tallyfy webhooks are automated messages sent to external systems when specific events occur in your workflows. They transmit JSON data packets to predefined URLs, enabling real-time integration with other applications without manual intervention. This guide explains how to configure and implement webhooks in Tallyfy and avoid the common pitfalls that trip people up.

### Understanding webhook types

Tallyfy offers two webhook configuration levels:

#### Template-level webhooks

Template-level webhooks trigger when **any step** within a process is completed. They also trigger when a process is initially launched, before any tasks are even completed. They transmit the complete process data, including all form fields and step statuses. Think of these as the "firehose" option - you get everything.

**Use cases:**
- Track overall process progress in external systems
- Update dashboards when any step changes
- Trigger comprehensive data exports
- Capture new process launches in external systems

#### Step-level webhooks

Step-level webhooks trigger when a **specific step** is completed. They provide targeted integration for individual tasks within a process. These are more surgical - only fire when that particular step is done.

**Use cases:**
- Send notifications at critical process milestones
- Trigger follow-up actions in other systems
- Export specific form field data collected at a particular step

### How webhook events flow

This diagram shows how Tallyfy sends webhook data to external systems when events occur in your workflows.

```d2
P: Process/Step
T: Tallyfy
Q: Queue
W: Webhook Service
M: Middleware (Zapier/Make/n8n)
E: External System (Slack/CRM/etc)

# Webhook Event Flow
Webhook Event Flow: {near: top-center}

1: P -> T: Complete step/Launch process
2: T -> T: Check webhook config

# Template vs Step Level
Template-level: {
  note1: Fires on ANY step or launch {near: T}
  3a: T -> Q: Queue template webhook with ALL process data
}

Step-level: {
  note2: Fires on SPECIFIC step only {near: T}
  3b: T -> Q: Queue step webhook with step data
}

4: Q -> W: Process webhook event

# Retry Loop (Max 3 attempts)
Retry: {
  5: W -> M: POST webhook_url\nX-Tallyfy-OrgID: [org_id]\nJSON payload
  Timeout: 30 seconds {near: W-M}
  
  # Success path
  Success: {
    6a: M --> W: Success response (2xx) {style.stroke-dash: 3}
    7a: W -> T: Mark delivered
    8a: M -> M: Validate X-Tallyfy-OrgID
    9a: M -> E: Trigger action (Send Slack message)
    10a: E --> M: Action confirmed {style.stroke-dash: 3}
  }
  
  # Failure path
  Failure: {
    6b: M --> W: Error/Timeout {style.stroke-dash: 3}
    7b: W -> W: Exponential backoff
    Retry timing: 1min, 5min, 15min {near: W}
  }
}

# Final failure
All attempts failed: {
  11: W -> T: Mark failed
  Log failure for debugging {near: T}
}
```

**What to notice:**
- **Two trigger types**: Template-level webhooks fire on ANY step completion or process launch, while step-level webhooks only fire for specific steps
- **Retry mechanism**: Failed webhook deliveries automatically retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff (1 minute, 5 minutes, 15 minutes) to handle temporary network issues
- **Security validation**: The X-Tallyfy-OrgID header authenticates webhook requests - always validate this in your middleware to prevent processing unauthorized webhooks

### Configuring template-level webhooks

<Steps>
1. Navigate to the template you want to configure
2. Click **Edit** to enter template editing mode
3. Open the **Advanced Settings** drawer
4. Locate the Webhooks section
5. Toggle webhook functionality on
6. Enter the destination URL in the **Template webhook URL** field
7. Note the **Template alias** for reference in your integration
</Steps>

### Configuring step-level webhooks

<Steps>
1. Navigate to the template containing your target step
2. Click **Edit** to enter template editing mode
3. Select the specific step that should trigger the webhook
4. Open the **Advanced** tab
5. Toggle webhook functionality on
6. Enter the destination URL in the webhook URL field
7. Save your changes
</Steps>

### Implementation example: Slack notifications

This example demonstrates how to send automated notifications to a Slack channel when an employee completes an onboarding process in Tallyfy.

#### Requirements

- Tallyfy account with Professional or Enterprise plan
- Zapier account (or alternative middleware like Make.com or Power Automate)
- Slack workspace with administrative access

:::note[Considering Integration Alternatives]
While Zapier can be useful for simple connections, we generally recommend more capable and cost-effective middleware solutions like **n8n**, **Make**, or **Microsoft Power Automate** for serious integrations - Zapier gets expensive fast.

For maximum control and flexibility, especially if you have development resources, consider using Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) to build custom integrations that leverage AI to generate code for serverless functions.

#### Step 1: Configure Zapier webhook receiver

<Steps>
1. Sign in to your Zapier account
2. Create a new Zap
3. Select **Webhooks by Zapier** as the trigger app
4. Choose **Catch Hook** as the trigger event

5. Copy the custom webhook URL provided by Zapier (you'll need this for Tallyfy)

</Steps>

#### Step 2: Configure Slack message action

<Steps>
1. Add an action step to your Zap.
2. Select **Slack** as the action app.
3. Choose **Send Channel Message** as the action event.

4. Connect your Slack account if not already connected.
5. Select the destination channel (e.g., #general).
6. Create a message template using webhook data.

7. Include relevant details like process name, step name, and assignee in the template.
</Steps>

#### Step 3: Configure Tallyfy webhook

<Steps>
1. Navigate to your onboarding template in Tallyfy.
2. Enter **Edit** mode.
3. For template-level notifications, open the **Advanced Settings** drawer.
4. Toggle webhooks on within the Advanced Settings.
5. Paste the Zapier webhook URL into the **Template webhook URL** field.
6. For step-specific notifications, select the final onboarding step.
7. Open the **Advanced** tab for that step.
8. Toggle webhooks on within the step's Advanced tab.
9. Paste the Zapier webhook URL into the step's webhook field.
10. Save your changes.
</Steps>

#### Step 4: Test the integration

<Steps>
1. Run your onboarding process
2. Complete the relevant step
3. Verify that the notification appears in your Slack channel

</Steps>

### Security considerations

For webhook security, Tallyfy includes the `X-Tallyfy-OrgID` header in all webhook requests. You can use this header to verify that incoming webhooks are legitimate by checking against your organization's ID - you definitely don't want to process random webhook spam.

:::warning[Important: Handle duplicate webhook events]
Webhooks can fire multiple times for the same event. For example, when a task is completed and then reopened and completed again, you'll receive multiple webhook notifications. Always implement [idempotency handling](/products/pro/integrations/handling-idempotency-in-webhooks-and-api/) to prevent duplicate actions in your integrated systems. Handling duplicates from the start is much easier than debugging why things ran twice later.
:::

### Best practices

- Use HTTPS URLs for webhook destinations (HTTP is asking for trouble)
- Implement webhook authentication in your receiving system
- Test webhooks thoroughly before relying on them in production (seriously, test them)
- Monitor webhook delivery using your middleware platform's logging tools
- Consider implementing retry logic for failed webhook deliveries
- Always validate the payload structure - external systems change without warning
