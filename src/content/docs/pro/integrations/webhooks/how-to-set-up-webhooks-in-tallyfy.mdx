## How webhooks work in Tallyfy

Tallyfy webhooks send automated JSON messages to external systems when specific workflow events happen. They POST data to URLs you define, giving you real-time integration with other apps. This guide covers how to set them up and avoid common pitfalls.

### Webhook types

Tallyfy has two webhook levels:

#### Template-level webhooks

Template-level webhooks fire when **any step** in a process is completed, when a process is launched, or when a process is completed. They send the full process data - all form fields and step statuses. Think of these as the "firehose" option.

**When a step has its own webhook URL set, that takes priority** over the template-level webhook for that specific step.

**Use cases:**
- Track overall process progress in external systems
- Update dashboards when any step changes
- Capture new process launches or completions

#### Step-level webhooks

Step-level webhooks fire only when a **specific step** is completed. More surgical - they only trigger when that particular step is done.

**Use cases:**
- Send notifications at key process milestones
- Trigger follow-up actions in other systems
- Export form field data collected at a particular step

### How webhook events flow

This diagram shows how Tallyfy sends webhook data to external systems when events occur in your workflows.

**What to notice:**
- **Two trigger types** - Template-level webhooks fire on any step completion, process launch, or process completion. Step-level webhooks only fire for that specific step.
- **Priority** - If a step has its own webhook URL, it's used instead of the template-level webhook for that step's completion event.
- **Security** - The `X-Tallyfy-orgID` header is included in every webhook request. Always validate this in your receiving system.

### Setting up template-level webhooks

<Steps>
1. Navigate to the template you want to configure
2. Click **Edit** to enter template editing mode
3. Open the **Advanced Settings** drawer
4. Find the Webhooks section
5. Toggle webhook functionality on
6. Enter the destination URL in the **Template webhook URL** field
7. Note the **Template alias** - you'll need it in your integration
</Steps>

### Setting up step-level webhooks

<Steps>
1. Navigate to the template containing your target step
2. Click **Edit** to enter template editing mode
3. Select the specific step that should trigger the webhook
4. Open the **Advanced** tab
5. Toggle webhook functionality on
6. Enter the destination URL in the webhook URL field
7. Save your changes
</Steps>

### Example: Slack notifications via middleware

Here's how to send Slack notifications when an employee completes an onboarding step in Tallyfy.

#### What you'll need

- Tallyfy account with Professional or Enterprise plan
- Middleware account (Make.com, Power Automate, n8n, or Zapier)
- Slack workspace with admin access

:::note[Choosing the right middleware]
Compare different [middleware platforms](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) based on your needs. Popular options include **n8n**, **Make**, **Microsoft Power Automate**, and Zapier - each with different pricing and capabilities.

For maximum control, especially if you have dev resources, consider using Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) to build custom integrations with AI-generated code for serverless functions.
:::

#### Step 1: Set up the middleware webhook receiver

<Steps>
1. Sign in to your middleware platform
2. Create a new workflow ("Zap" in Zapier, "Flow" in Power Automate, "Scenario" in Make)
3. Select **Webhooks** as the trigger app
4. Choose **Catch Hook** or **When HTTP request is received** as the trigger event

    ![Zapier Catch Hook trigger](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy/pro/webhooks-zapier-catch-hook-trigger.png)

5. Copy the webhook URL provided by your middleware platform - you'll paste it into Tallyfy next

    ![Zapier webhook URL](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy/pro/webhooks-zapier-webhook-url.png)
</Steps>

#### Step 2: Configure the Slack message action

<Steps>
1. Add an action step to your workflow.
2. Select **Slack** as the action app.
3. Choose **Send Channel Message** as the action event.

    ![Zapier Slack action](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy/pro/webhooks-zapier-slack-action.png)

4. Connect your Slack account if not already connected.
5. Select the destination channel (e.g., #general).
6. Build a message template using the webhook data fields.

    ![Slack message template](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy/pro/webhooks-zapier-slack-message-template.png)
7. Include details like process name, step name, and assignee.
</Steps>

#### Step 3: Configure the Tallyfy webhook

<Steps>
1. Navigate to your onboarding template in Tallyfy.
2. Enter **Edit** mode.
3. For template-level notifications, open the **Advanced Settings** drawer.
4. Toggle webhooks on.
5. Paste the middleware webhook URL into the **Template webhook URL** field.
6. For step-specific notifications, select the relevant step instead.
7. Open the **Advanced** tab for that step.
8. Toggle webhooks on and paste the middleware webhook URL.
9. Save your changes.
</Steps>

#### Step 4: Test the integration

<Steps>
1. Run your onboarding process
2. Complete the relevant step
3. Verify the notification appears in your Slack channel

</Steps>

### Security

Tallyfy includes the `X-Tallyfy-orgID` header in all webhook requests. Validate this header against your organization's ID to confirm the webhook is legitimate - you don't want to process random webhook spam.

![X-Tallyfy-OrgID header](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy/pro/webhooks-x-tallyfy-orgid-header.png)

:::warning[Handle duplicate webhook events]
Webhooks can fire multiple times for the same event. For example, if a task is completed, then reopened and completed again, you'll get multiple notifications. Always implement [idempotency handling](/products/pro/integrations/handling-idempotency-in-webhooks-and-api/) to prevent duplicate actions. It's much easier to handle this from the start than debug it later.
:::

### Troubleshooting

**Webhooks not firing?** Here's how to diagnose:

1. **Verify the URL is correct** - Copy and paste it fresh, don't type it manually
2. **Check URL accessibility** - Test your webhook URL with RequestBin or Postman first
3. **Confirm webhook is enabled** - Both the toggle AND the URL field must be set
4. **Test with a simple receiver** - Use webhook.site or RequestBin to verify Tallyfy is sending data
5. **Check for HTTPS** - Many receivers require HTTPS, not HTTP
6. **Look for auth requirements** - Your receiver might be rejecting unauthenticated requests
7. **Verify step completion** - Webhooks only fire when steps are actually completed (not just opened)

:::tip[Testing webhooks]
**Always test with webhook.site first.** Get a unique URL there, use it in Tallyfy, then complete a task. You'll see exactly what data Tallyfy sends. Once you've confirmed data is flowing, switch to your real webhook URL.
:::

### Best practices

- Use HTTPS URLs for webhook destinations - HTTP is asking for trouble
- Validate the `X-Tallyfy-orgID` header in your receiving system
- Test webhooks before relying on them in production
- Monitor webhook delivery using your middleware platform's logs
- Build retry logic into your receiving system for reliability
- Use webhook.site or RequestBin for initial testing before connecting production systems
- Validate the payload structure on your end - don't assume it won't change
