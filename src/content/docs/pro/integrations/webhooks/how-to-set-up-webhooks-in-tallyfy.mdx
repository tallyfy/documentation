## Webhook Configuration Guide

Webhooks are automated messages sent from Tallyfy to external systems when specific events occur. They transmit JSON data packets to predefined URLs, enabling real-time integration with other applications without manual intervention. This guide explains how to configure and implement webhooks in Tallyfy.

### Understanding Webhook Types

Tallyfy offers two webhook configuration levels:

#### Template-Level Webhooks

Template-level webhooks trigger when **any step** within a process is completed. They also trigger when a process is initially launched, before any tasks are even completed. They transmit the complete process data, including all form fields and step statuses.

**Use cases:**
- Track overall process progress in external systems
- Update dashboards when any step changes
- Trigger comprehensive data exports
- Capture new process launches in external systems

#### Step-Level Webhooks

Step-level webhooks trigger when a **specific step** is completed. They provide targeted integration for individual tasks within a process.

**Use cases:**
- Send notifications at critical process milestones
- Trigger follow-up actions in other systems
- Export specific form field data collected at a particular step

### Configuring Template-Level Webhooks

<Steps>
1. Navigate to the template you want to configure
2. Click **Edit** to enter template editing mode
3. Open the **Advanced Settings** drawer
4. Locate the Webhooks section
5. Toggle webhook functionality on
6. Enter the destination URL in the **Template webhook URL** field
7. Note the **Template alias** for reference in your integration
</Steps>

### Configuring Step-Level Webhooks

<Steps>
1. Navigate to the template containing your target step
2. Click **Edit** to enter template editing mode
3. Select the specific step that should trigger the webhook
4. Open the **Advanced** tab
5. Toggle webhook functionality on
6. Enter the destination URL in the webhook URL field
7. Save your changes
</Steps>

## Implementation Example: Slack Notifications

This example demonstrates how to send automated notifications to a Slack channel when an employee completes an onboarding process in Tallyfy.

### Requirements

- Tallyfy account with Professional or Enterprise plan
- Zapier account (or alternative middleware like Make.com or Power Automate)
- Slack workspace with administrative access

:::note[Considering Integration Alternatives]
While Zapier can be useful for simple connections, we generally recommend more robust and cost-effective middleware solutions like **n8n**, **Make**, or **Microsoft Power Automate** for serious integrations.

For maximum control and flexibility, especially if you have development resources, consider using Tallyfy's [Open API](/pro/integrations/open-api/) to build custom integrations, potentially leveraging AI to generate code for serverless functions.

### Step 1: Configure Zapier Webhook Receiver

<Steps>
1. Sign in to your Zapier account
2. Create a new Zap
3. Select **Webhooks by Zapier** as the trigger app
4. Choose **Catch Hook** as the trigger event

</Steps>

### Step 2: Configure Slack Message Action

<Steps>
1. Add an action step to your Zap
2. Select **Slack** as the action app
3. Choose **Send Channel Message** as the action event

4. Connect your Slack account if not already connected
5. Configure the message:
   - Select the destination channel (e.g., #general)
   - Create a message template using webhook data
   - Include relevant details like process name, step name, and assignee

</Steps>

### Step 3: Configure Tallyfy Webhook

<Steps>
1. Navigate to your onboarding template in Tallyfy
2. Enter **Edit** mode
3. For template-level notifications:
   - Open the **Advanced Settings** drawer
   - Toggle webhooks on
   - Paste the Zapier webhook URL into the **Template webhook URL** field
4. For step-specific notifications:
   - Select the final onboarding step
   - Open the **Advanced** tab
   - Toggle webhooks on
   - Paste the Zapier webhook URL
5. Save your changes
</Steps>

### Step 4: Test the Integration

<Steps>
1. Run your onboarding process
2. Complete the relevant step
3. Verify that the notification appears in your Slack channel
</Steps>

## Security Considerations

For webhook security, Tallyfy includes the `X-Tallyfy-OrgID` header in all webhook requests. You can use this header to verify that incoming webhooks are legitimate by checking against your organization's ID.

### Best Practices

- Use HTTPS URLs for webhook destinations
- Implement webhook authentication in your receiving system
- Test webhooks thoroughly before relying on them in production
- Monitor webhook delivery using your middleware platform's logging tools
- Consider implementing retry logic for failed webhook deliveries
