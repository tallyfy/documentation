description: Tallyfy webhooks deliver JSON payloads with different structures for
  process-level events (launches and completions) and task-level events (task completions)
  containing workflow data, form fields, guest access links, and task assignment info
  for real-time integration with external systems.

## How webhook payloads work

When Tallyfy sends a webhook to your endpoint, it delivers a JSON payload with data about the event. The structure depends on the webhook type - **process-level webhooks** (fired when a process launches or completes) versus **task-level webhooks** (fired when a specific task completes).

This reference shows the actual structure produced by Tallyfy's API code, not theoretical examples.

## Process-level webhook payload

Process-level webhooks fire when someone launches a new process or when a process completes. They include the full process state and all kick-off form data.

### Top-level structure

```
Process Webhook Payload
├── Process information (from RunTransformer)
│   ├── id, increment_id, name, summary
│   ├── status, progress, whole_progress
│   ├── checklist_id, checklist_title
│   ├── created_at, started_at, completed_at
│   ├── owner_id, started_by
│   ├── collaborators (array of user IDs)
│   └── Kick-off form data
│       ├── prerun (structured form field values)

```

## Task-level webhook payload

Task-level webhooks fire when a specific task completes. They contain detailed info about the completed task, all process data collected so far, and the next task that needs attention.

**What's `next_task`?** It's the first visible incomplete task ordered by position number. "Visible" means not auto-skipped by automation rules. "Incomplete" means not yet completed (includes tasks that are in-progress). Returns an empty array `[]` if all tasks in the process are done.

        }
      ],
      "guests": []
    }
  }
}
```

## Guest links

The `guest-links` object provides direct access URLs for all guest assignees in a process. You can use it to send personalized emails or SMS notifications to guests with direct links to their assigned tasks.

### Structure

```json
"guest-links": {
  "guest.email@company.com": {
    "link_for_guest": "https://go.tallyfy.com/guest-all-task/{org_id}/{guest_code}"
  }
}
```

### Key details

- **Included in both webhook types** - process-level and task-level
- **All unique guests** - every unique guest assigned anywhere in the process
- **Direct access** - links bypass login, so guests click and see their tasks
- **Persistent codes** - guest codes stay stable across the process lifecycle

### Common use cases

- **Custom email notifications** - build your own notification system using Zapier or Make
- **SMS integration** - send task reminders via Twilio with direct access links
- **CRM integration** - update external CRM records with guest task links
- **Client portals** - embed guest task links in customer-facing dashboards

## Form field structures

Form fields appear in webhooks using different structures depending on context.

### In `this_task.captures` - detailed structure

Task-specific form fields use the complete structure with timeline IDs as keys:

```json
"captures": {
  "capture_timeline_123": {
    "alias": "contract-value",
    "label": "Contract Value",
    "value": "50000"
  },
  "capture_timeline_456": {
    "alias": "approval-notes",
    "label": "Approval Notes",
    "value": "All terms look good."
  }
}
```

### In `form-fields` - flat structure

All process form fields use a simplified flat structure with aliases as keys:

```json
"form-fields": {
  "contract-value": "50000",
  "approval-notes": "All terms look good.",
  "initial-review-notes": "Contract appears standard.",
  "legal-review-status": "Approved"
}
```

### In `process.process_forms` - organized by step

Form fields grouped by which step they belong to:

```json
"process_forms": {
  "step001": {
    "capture_timeline_001": {
      "alias": "initial-review-notes",
      "label": "Initial Review Notes",
      "value": "Contract appears standard."
    }
  },
  "step002": {
    "capture_timeline_002": {
      "alias": "legal-review-status",
      "label": "Legal Review Status",
      "value": "Approved"
    }
  }
}
```

## Date field formatting

Date fields in captures respect your organization's webhook date format setting. Tallyfy supports two formats:

**ISO 8601 format** (default):
```json
"start-date": {
  "alias": "start-date",
  "label": "Contract Start Date",
  "value": "2025-10-15"
}
```

**Localized format** (if configured as `d/m/Y h:i A T`):
```json
"start-date": {
  "alias": "start-date",
  "label": "Contract Start Date",
  "value": "15/10/2025 09:00 AM UTC"
}
```

This format applies to all date fields across the webhook payload.

## Task assignment info

Task owners appear in the `owners` object containing both organization members and external guests.

```json
"owners": {
  "users": [
    {
      "id": "user123",
      "email": "john@acmecorp.com",
      "full_name": "John Smith"
    },
    {
      "id": "user456",
      "email": "jane@acmecorp.com",
      "full_name": "Jane Doe"
    }
  ],
  "guests": [
    "external.reviewer@vendor.com",
    "compliance@vendor.com"
  ]
}
```

**Important differences**:
- `users` contains full objects with ID, email, and name
- `guests` contains only email addresses as strings
- Use `guest-links` to get access URLs for guests

## Common integration patterns

### Sending custom emails to guests

Use the `guest-links` object to send personalized emails:

```javascript
// In your webhook handler (e.g., Zapier, Make, n8n)
const guestLinks = webhookPayload['guest-links'];

for (const [email, linkData] of Object.entries(guestLinks)) {
  sendEmail({
    to: email,
    subject: `New task assigned: ${webhookPayload.this_task.title}`,
    body: `You have a new task. Click here to access: ${linkData.link_for_guest}`
  });
}
```

### Extracting all collected data

Get all form data collected across the entire process:

```javascript
// Flat structure - simplest for most integrations
const allFormData = webhookPayload['form-fields'];
// Example: { "contract-value": "50000", "approval-notes": "..." }

// Or get kick-off form data specifically
const kickoffData = webhookPayload.process.prerun;
// Example: { "vendor-name": "Widget Suppliers Inc", ... }
```

### Triggering follow-up actions

Use the `next_task` object to prepare for upcoming steps:

```javascript
const nextTask = webhookPayload.next_task;

// next_task is an empty array [] when all tasks are done
if (nextTask && nextTask.title === "Execute Contract") {
  // Prepare contract execution system
  // Notify legal team
  // Update external tracking system
}
```
