## When to use webhooks

Webhooks enable data collection during a process and transmission to another service.

## When a process is launched

For template-level webhooks, a webhook is triggered immediately when a process is launched, before any tasks are even completed. This allows you to track new process instances as soon as they are created. It's a great way to keep track of the progress and gather important data right from the start.

## When a specific task in a process is completed

This webhook triggers when a specific task is completed. It allows you to stay updated on important milestones in your process.

If you want to see more examples and learn how to use our webhooks, watch our tutorial videos below. They demonstrate practical use-cases and provide step-by-step instructions.

### Example: How to export data from a task to a spreadsheet

This video demonstrates how to export form field values from Tallyfy to a spreadsheet using Zapier.

:::note[Considering Integration Alternatives]
While Zapier can be useful for simple connections, we generally recommend more robust and cost-effective middleware solutions like **n8n**, **Make**, or **Microsoft Power Automate** for serious integrations.

For maximum control and flexibility, especially if you have development resources, consider using Tallyfy's [Open API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) to build custom integrations, potentially leveraging AI to generate code for serverless functions.

### Example: Send form field data from multiple tasks via a webhook

This video demonstrates connecting a Tallyfy template to a middleware system to send form data from previous steps to other services.

Tallyfy allows you to choose between two date formats for your webhooks. Take a look at the screenshots below to see how they appear:

A note on security - our webhooks come with a header `X-Tallyfy-OrgID` which contains your organization ID - offering an extra layer of authentication.
