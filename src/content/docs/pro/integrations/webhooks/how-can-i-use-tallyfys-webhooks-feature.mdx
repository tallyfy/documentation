## Common ways to use Tallyfy webhooks

Tallyfy's webhooks automatically send data to external systems when specific events happen in your workflows. Three main events can trigger a webhook:

### Trigger: process launched

Set up a webhook at the template level. It fires *immediately* when someone launches a new process from that template - even before any tasks are done.

*   **Use case**: Track new process starts in real time (e.g., log every new client onboarding in a spreadsheet or database).

### Trigger: task completed

Set up a webhook on a specific step within a template. It fires only when *that particular task* is completed.

*   **Use case**: Trigger follow-up actions in other systems when a key milestone is reached (e.g., when "Contract Signed" is completed, send data to your finance system).

### Trigger: process completed

A template-level webhook also fires when all tasks in a process are completed. This lets you trigger external actions when an entire workflow finishes - not just individual tasks.

*   **Use case**: Mark a deal as "closed" in your CRM or archive records when a full process wraps up.

### Video examples

These videos show practical ways to use webhooks, often with a middleware tool like Zapier:

These examples use Zapier, but the same concepts work with Make.com or Power Automate - which often provide better value for complex integrations.

### Webhook payload data

Webhooks send detailed JSON data. You can see an example of the structure here:

[Webhook-Sample.json](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/Webhook-Sample.json)

:::tip[Webhooks carry ALL data up to that point]
When a webhook fires, it carries ALL information collected in the process up to that point - like a fishing line that pulls everything with it. This includes:
- All form fields from the kick-off form
- All form fields from every completed task before this one
- The current task's data
- Process metadata, guest links, and context

One webhook gives you everything that's happened so far. You don't need separate webhooks for each piece of data.
:::

#### Webhook payload structure

The JSON payload contains detailed event information. Key sections for **task completion** webhooks include:

- **`this_task`**: The task that triggered the webhook - includes `id`, `title`, `alias`, `status`, `summary`, `deadline`, `position`, `captures` (form field values), `owners` (assigned users and guests), `completed_at`, `completed_by`, and `assets` (attached files with download links).
- **`next_task`**: The first incomplete task that isn't auto-skipped, ordered by position. Includes the same fields as `this_task` (minus assets). Returns an empty object if all tasks are done.
- **`process`**: The overall process instance - includes `id`, `organization_id`, `name`, `summary`, `status`, `progress`, `created_at`, `ClientURL`, `prerun` (kick-off form values), `process_forms` (all form field values across all tasks), and `tags`.
- **`template`**: The source template - includes `id`, `title`, `alias`, and `summary`.
- **`form-fields`**: A flat map of all form field values across all tasks and the kick-off form, keyed by alias.
- **`process-tasks`**: A map of task aliases to task IDs for the entire process.
- **`guest-links`**: URLs for each guest assignee to access their tasks.
- **`launcher`** and **`completer`**: Info about who launched the process and who completed the task.

For **process launch/completion** webhooks, the payload includes process data, `process-tasks`, `ko-form-fields` (kick-off values), `guest-links`, and `launcher`.

Refer to the sample JSON file linked above for the full structure.

### Date formats

Tallyfy lets you choose between two date formats for webhook data. You select this in your organization settings:

- **ISO format** (default): `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ssZ`
- **Human-readable format**: `d/m/Y h:i A T` - dates are converted to your organization's timezone

![Date format ISO](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy/pro/webhooks-date-format-iso.png)

### Security header

Tallyfy webhooks include an `X-Tallyfy-orgID` header containing your unique organization ID. Your receiving system can check this header to validate that the request genuinely came from your Tallyfy account.

### Handling duplicate events

:::caution[Webhooks can fire multiple times]
Webhooks might fire more than once for the same event. For example, if a task is completed, then reopened and completed again, you'll get multiple webhook notifications. Your receiving system should implement [idempotency handling](/products/pro/integrations/handling-idempotency-in-webhooks-and-api/) to avoid processing the same event twice.
