## When to use webhooks

Have you ever wanted to collect data during a process and send it to another service? With Tallyfy's webhooks feature, you can easily accomplish this.

## When a process is launched

This webhook is triggered when the first task of a process is completed, regardless of the task's position. It's a great way to keep track of the progress and gather important data.

## When a specific task in a process is completed

This webhook triggers when a specific task is completed. It allows you to stay updated on important milestones in your process.

If you want to see more examples and learn how to use our webhooks, watch our tutorial videos below. They demonstrate practical use-cases and provide step-by-step instructions.
