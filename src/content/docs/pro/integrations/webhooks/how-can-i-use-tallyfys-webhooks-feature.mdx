## Common Ways to Use Webhooks

Webhooks send data automatically from Tallyfy to other systems when certain events happen. Here are the main events that can trigger a webhook:

### Trigger: When a process is launched

You can set up a webhook at the template level. This webhook sends a notification *immediately* when someone launches a new process from that template, even before any tasks are done.

*   **Use Case**: Track new process starts in real-time (e.g., log every new client onboarding started in a spreadsheet or database).

### Trigger: When a specific task is completed

You can set up a webhook on a specific step within a template. This webhook sends a notification only when *that particular task* is completed.

*   **Use Case**: Trigger follow-up actions in other systems when a key milestone is reached (e.g., when "Contract Signed" task is completed, send data to the finance system).

### Examples (Videos)

These videos show practical ways to use webhooks, often with a middleware tool like Zapier:

These examples might use Zapier, but the ideas work similarly with other tools like Make.com or Power Automate, which are often better for more complex tasks.

### What data is sent? (Webhook Payload)

Webhooks send detailed information in JSON format. You can see an example of the data structure here:

### Date Formats

Tallyfy lets you choose between two standard date formats for the dates included in webhook data. You select this when setting up the webhook.

### Security Note

Tallyfy webhooks include a special header called `X-Tallyfy-OrgID` which contains your unique organization ID. The system receiving the webhook can check this header for an extra layer of validation to ensure the message genuinely came from your Tallyfy account.
