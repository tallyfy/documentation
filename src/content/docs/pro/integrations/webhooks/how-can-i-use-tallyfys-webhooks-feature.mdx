## Common Ways to Use Webhooks

Webhooks send data automatically from Tallyfy to other systems when certain events happen. Here are the main events that can trigger a webhook:

### Trigger: When a process is launched

You can set up a webhook at the template level. This webhook sends a notification *immediately* when someone launches a new process from that template, even before any tasks are done.

*   **Use Case**: Track new process starts in real-time (e.g., log every new client onboarding started in a spreadsheet or database).

### Trigger: When a specific task is completed

You can set up a webhook on a specific step within a template. This webhook sends a notification only when *that particular task* is completed.

*   **Use Case**: Trigger follow-up actions in other systems when a key milestone is reached (e.g., when "Contract Signed" task is completed, send data to the finance system).

### Video examples

These videos show practical ways to use webhooks, often with a middleware tool like Zapier:

These examples might use Zapier, but the ideas work similarly with other tools like Make.com or Power Automate, which are often better for more complex tasks.

### Webhook payload data

Webhooks send detailed information in JSON format. You can see an example of the data structure here:

ðŸ“Œ [Webhook-Sample.json](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/Webhook-Sample.json)

#### Webhook Payload Structure

The JSON payload sent by the webhook contains detailed information about the event. Key sections include:

- **`this_task__*`**: Information about the specific task that triggered the webhook (e.g., `this_task__id`, `this_task__title`, `this_task__status`, `this_task__completed_by__email`, `this_task__completed_at`).
- **`this_task__captures__*`**: Contains the values submitted to form fields within the completed task. The structure varies by field type (e.g., `this_task__captures__field_alias__value`).
- **`next_task__*`**: Details about the task immediately following the completed task in the sequence (e.g., `next_task__id`, `next_task__title`, `next_task__owners__users`). This might be null if it was the last task.
- **`process__*`**: Information about the overall process instance (e.g., `process__id`, `process__name`, `process__status`, `process__created_at__date`).
- **`process__prerun__*`**: Contains values submitted in the kick-off form fields for the process.
- **`process__process_forms__*`**: Contains values for *all* form fields across *all* tasks in the process up to that point.
- **`template__*`**: Details about the template the process was launched from (e.g., `template__id`, `template__title`, `template__version`).

Refer to the sample JSON file linked above for the complete structure and specific field names.

### Date Formats

Tallyfy lets you choose between two standard date formats for the dates included in webhook data. You select this when setting up the webhook.

### Security Note

Tallyfy webhooks include a special header called `X-Tallyfy-OrgID` which contains your unique organization ID. The system receiving the webhook can check this header for an extra layer of validation to ensure the message genuinely came from your Tallyfy account.

### Handling duplicate events

:::caution[Webhooks can fire multiple times]
Be aware that webhooks might fire more than once for the same event. For example, if a task is completed, then reopened and completed again, you'll receive multiple webhook notifications. Your receiving system should implement [idempotency handling](/products/pro/integrations/handling-idempotency-in-webhooks-and-api/) to prevent processing the same event multiple times.
