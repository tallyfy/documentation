## Sending Custom Emails Using Webhooks

You can use Tallyfy's [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) feature, combined with a [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) tool (like Zapier, Make, Power Automate), to automatically send custom email notifications when something happens in Tallyfy (like a specific task being completed).

### What you need

- A Tallyfy account (webhooks are usually available on paid plans).
- An account with a middleware service (Zapier, Make, Power Automate, etc.).
- Basic understanding of how webhooks work and how to set up workflows in your middleware tool.

:::note[Choosing a Middleware Tool]
Again, Zapier is fine for simple email notifications. Make.com or Power Automate offer more options if needed. Developers can also build custom webhook receivers.

### How to set it up (General Steps)

The exact steps depend on your middleware tool, but here's the general idea:

#### Step 1: Get a Webhook URL from your Middleware Tool

<Steps>
1. Go to your middleware tool (e.g., Zapier).
2. Start creating a new automation/workflow (e.g., a "Zap").
3. Choose "Webhook" as the trigger (the starting point).
4. Select the option to "Catch Hook" or "Receive Webhook".
5. The middleware tool will give you a unique Webhook URL. Copy this URL.
</Steps>

#### Step 2: Set up the Webhook in Tallyfy

<Steps>
1. In Tallyfy, go to the template and find the specific step where you want the email to be triggered (e.g., the step whose completion should send the email).
2. Open the step's settings (often in the "Advanced" tab or a dedicated "Webhooks" tab).
3. Find the option to "Emit webhook when completed" (or similar) and turn it ON.
4. Paste the Webhook URL you copied from your middleware tool into the URL field.
5. Send a test webhook from Tallyfy to make sure the middleware receives it.
</Steps>

#### Step 3: Set up the Email Action in your Middleware Tool

<Steps>
1. Go back to your middleware tool.
2. Confirm it received the test data from Tallyfy.
3. Add an "Action" step to your workflow.
4. Choose an email action (e.g., "Send Email via Zapier", "Send Email with Gmail", "Send Email with Outlook 365").
</Steps>

#### Step 4: Customize Your Email

<Steps>
1. In the email action step, configure who the email should go TO. You can often use data from the Tallyfy webhook (like an email address entered in a form field).
2. Write the SUBJECT line. You can include data from Tallyfy here too (e.g., "Task Completed: {{Process Name}}").
3. Write the BODY of the email. Use data from the Tallyfy webhook to include relevant details (e.g., "Task '{{Task Name}}' was completed by {{Completed By Name}}.").
4. Add formatting or links back to Tallyfy if needed.
</Steps>

### Testing and Turning It On

- Test the whole setup by running a test process in Tallyfy and completing the trigger step.
- Check if the email arrives and looks correct.
- Once you're happy, turn ON your automation/workflow in the middleware tool.

Now, every time that specific step is completed in Tallyfy, your custom email will be sent automatically.
