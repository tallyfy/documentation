## Trigger custom emails from Tallyfy webhooks

Tallyfy's [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) send JSON data to external URLs whenever key events happen - like a task getting completed or a process being launched. Pair this with a [middleware](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) tool (Zapier, Make, or Power Automate) and you can automatically fire off custom emails based on those events.

The webhook payload includes task details, form field values, assignee info, and process data - so your emails can pull in all the context they need.

### What you need

- A Tallyfy account on a paid plan.
- An account with a middleware service (Zapier, Make, Power Automate, etc.).
- A basic grasp of how webhooks and middleware automations work.

:::note[Picking a middleware tool]
Zapier works well for simple email notifications. Make.com or Power Automate give you more control for complex scenarios. Developers can also build custom webhook receivers directly.

### General setup steps

The exact steps vary by middleware tool, but here's the overall flow:

#### Step 1: Get a webhook URL from your middleware tool

<Steps>
1. Go to your middleware tool (e.g., Zapier).
2. Start creating a new automation (e.g., a "Zap").
3. Choose "Webhook" as the trigger.
4. Select "Catch Hook" or "Receive Webhook".
5. Copy the unique webhook URL the tool gives you.
</Steps>

#### Step 2: Configure the webhook in Tallyfy

You can set webhooks at two levels in Tallyfy - on a specific step, or on the entire template.

<Steps>
1. Open the template and go to the step whose completion should trigger the email.
2. In the step's settings, find the webhook option and turn it ON.
3. Paste the webhook URL from your middleware tool.
4. Send a test webhook to confirm your middleware receives it.
</Steps>

Tallyfy sends the webhook as a POST request with an `X-Tallyfy-orgID` header identifying your organization.

#### Step 3: Set up the email action in your middleware tool

<Steps>
1. Go back to your middleware tool.
2. Confirm it received test data from Tallyfy.
3. Add an "Action" step to your workflow.
4. Choose an email action (e.g., "Send Email via Gmail" or "Send Email with Outlook 365").
</Steps>

#### Step 4: Customize your email

<Steps>
1. Set the TO address - you can pull this from the Tallyfy webhook data (e.g., an email captured in a form field or from the task's assignee list).
2. Write the SUBJECT line using webhook data (e.g., "Task Completed: `{{Process Name}}`").
3. Write the BODY using details from the payload - task name, who completed it, form field values, and a link back to the process.
4. Format as needed and add any extra links.
</Steps>

### Testing and going live

- Run a test process in Tallyfy and complete the trigger step.
- Check that the email arrives and looks right.
- Once it's working, turn ON the automation in your middleware tool.

That's it. Every time that step gets completed, your custom email fires automatically.
