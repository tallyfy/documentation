## How to use webhooks to send emails

When a task is completed - send a webhook to any middleware or similar platform and then using that as an event or "signal" - shoot off an email. We will use Zapier here - but middleware is a commodity now and you can use any system you like - such as Make.com, Microsoft Power Automate, etc.

### Step 1: Get the Webhook URL

First, select the "Webhook" trigger in Zapier and copy the webhook URL provided.

### Step 2: Paste the Webhook and Send a Sample

Paste the webhook into your Tallyfy step and send a sample webhook to Zapier. This helps to ensure the integration is working correctly.

### Step 3: Pull in the Sample Webhook

After completing the sample step in Tallyfy, a sample "Hook" will appear in Zapier. Simply click it to sync your step to Zapier.

### Step 4: Add an Email Action to Your Zap

If your email system is supported by Zapier, you can send an email directly from Zapier. Alternatively, Zapier has its own built-in email relay system.

### Step 5: Customize Your Email

Use the information passed from Tallyfy to customize your email. You can set custom email address, subject, and body using the fields provided.
