## Sending Custom Emails Using Webhooks

Tallyfy's webhook functionality can trigger automated email notifications when specific workflow events occur. This guide demonstrates how to configure task completion emails using middleware integration.

### Prerequisites

- A Tallyfy account with webhook access
- A middleware account (Zapier, Make.com, or Microsoft Power Automate)
- Basic understanding of webhooks and email configuration

### Configuration Steps

#### Step 1: Obtain the Webhook URL from Middleware

1. Sign in to your middleware platform (this example uses Zapier)
2. Create a new automation and select "Webhook" as the trigger
3. Choose the "Catch Hook" option to generate a webhook URL
4. Copy the generated URL for use in Tallyfy

#### Step 2: Configure the Webhook in Tallyfy

1. Navigate to the step settings in your Tallyfy process template
2. Select the webhook option and paste the URL from Step 1
3. Configure when the webhook should trigger (e.g., on step completion)
4. Send a test webhook to verify connectivity

#### Step 3: Process the Webhook Data

1. Return to your middleware platform
2. Confirm receipt of the test webhook data
3. Review the data structure received from Tallyfy
4. Continue configuring your automation flow

#### Step 4: Add an Email Action

1. Add an email action to your automation flow
2. Select your preferred email service (middleware's built-in email or your email provider)
3. Configure the action to send emails when the webhook is received

#### Step 5: Customize the Email Content

1. Configure the email recipient field using data from the webhook
2. Create a descriptive subject line incorporating relevant process information
3. Compose the email body with dynamic content from the webhook data
4. Include appropriate formatting and links back to Tallyfy if needed

### Testing and Deployment

After completing the configuration, test the entire flow by running a process in Tallyfy and completing the relevant step. Verify that the email is sent with the correct information and formatting.

Once tested, activate the automation in your middleware platform to enable ongoing email notifications for all future task completions.
