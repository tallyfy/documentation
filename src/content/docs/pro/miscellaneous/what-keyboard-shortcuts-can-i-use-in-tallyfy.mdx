## Keyboard shortcuts in Tallyfy

Keyboard shortcuts enable faster navigation and task completion in Tallyfy by providing quick access to frequently used functions and workflow actions.

### General shortcuts

These universal shortcuts function on most Tallyfy pages, except when actively using the template editor or viewing running process details.

- **Create a one-off task**: Press `Ctrl + Option + T` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Alt + T` (Windows) to quickly create standalone tasks.
- **Launch a process**: Press `Ctrl + Option + P` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Alt + P` (Windows) to open the Templates section for process launching.

:::note[Key equivalents]
The `Option` key on Mac keyboards corresponds to the `Alt` key on Windows keyboards.

### Shortcuts for completing forms

When completing [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) with [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/), these shortcuts improve data entry efficiency:

- **Tab key**: Navigate between form fields and move through options within dropdowns or radio button groups for sequential data entry.
- **Spacebar**: Select or activate options including dropdown items, radio button selections, checkbox toggles, and file upload button activation.
