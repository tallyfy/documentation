## Keyboard shortcuts in Tallyfy

Keyboard shortcuts let you navigate and complete work faster without reaching for the mouse.

### General shortcuts

These shortcuts work on most Tallyfy pages, except inside the template editor or when viewing running process details.

- **Create a one-off task** - Press `Ctrl + Option + T` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Alt + T` (Windows) to create a standalone task.
- **Launch a process** - Press `Ctrl + Option + P` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Alt + P` (Windows) to open the Templates section and launch a process.

:::note[Key equivalents]
The `Option` key on Mac is the same as `Alt` on Windows.

### Shortcuts for completing forms

When completing [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) with [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/), these shortcuts speed up data entry:

- **Tab key** - Move between form fields and cycle through options in dropdowns or radio button groups.
- **Spacebar** - Select or toggle options, including dropdown items, radio buttons, checkboxes, and file upload buttons.
