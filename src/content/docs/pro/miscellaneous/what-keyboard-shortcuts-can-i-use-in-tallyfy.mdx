## Using keyboard shortcuts in Tallyfy

Keyboard shortcuts can help you perform common actions in Tallyfy faster.

### General shortcuts (from most screens)

These shortcuts work on most Tallyfy pages, except when you are inside the template editor or viewing a running process.

- **Create a one-off task**: Press `Ctrl + Option + T` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Alt + T` (Windows).
- **Launch a process**: Press `Ctrl + Option + P` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Alt + P` (Windows). This opens the template library.

*(Note: The `Option` key on Mac is the same as the `Alt` key on Windows keyboards)*

### Shortcuts when filling out forms

When you are completing a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) with [form fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/):

- Use the `Tab` key to move between form fields (and also between options within fields like dropdowns or radio buttons).
- Use the `Spacebar` to select or check an option (like choosing a dropdown item, selecting a radio button option, checking a checkbox, or activating a file upload button).
