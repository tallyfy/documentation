## What keyboard shortcuts can I use in Tallyfy<sup>®</sup>?

Keyboard shortcuts enable faster navigation and task completion in Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> by providing quick access to frequently used functions and workflow actions.

### What general shortcuts work throughout Tallyfy?

These universal shortcuts function on most Tallyfy pages, except when actively using the template editor or viewing running process details.

- **Launch a process**: Press `Ctrl + Option + P` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Alt + P` (Windows) to open the template library for process launching.
