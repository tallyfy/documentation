## How can you translate content both in-app and your content

## App Language

With Tallyfy, you can choose your preferred language for the product's user interface. We offer a wide range of options, including English, Spanish, Dutch, Portuguese, Vietnamese, Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, German, and French. If you want to see Tallyfy in a language not on the list, simply contact us. Remember, this only affects the UI and not your actual content.

## Content Language

Tallyfy goes a step further by providing real-time translation for your content. Using Azure Cognitive Services Text Translation, any language can be translated to your desired target language. This means both members and guests can have their content translated in real time. You just need to set your language preference from the "globe" on the top navigation menu. A green globe ensures that Azure Cognitive is connected and ready to translate your content.
