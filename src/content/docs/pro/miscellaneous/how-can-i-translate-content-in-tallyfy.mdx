## How can I translate content in Tallyfy<sup>¬Æ</sup>?

Tallyfy<sup>¬Æ</sup> enables multilingual teams to collaborate effectively through two comprehensive translation approaches:

1.  **Interface Language Customization**: Modify the display language for Tallyfy<sup>¬Æ</sup> menus, buttons, and system interface text
