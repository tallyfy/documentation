## How to translate content in Tallyfy

Tallyfy offers two types of translation capabilities:
1. User interface language selection
2. Real-time content translation through Azure Cognitive Services

### Changing the user interface language

The user interface language affects only Tallyfy's menus, buttons, and system text - not your content.

1. Click the globe icon in the top navigation bar
2. Select your preferred language from the dropdown menu
3. The interface will immediately change to your selected language

- Dutch
- Portuguese
- Vietnamese
- Mandarin Chinese
- Japanese
- German
- French

If you need a language not currently offered, contact Tallyfy support to request additional language options.

### Setting up real-time content translation

Content translation allows both members and guests to view all user-created content in their preferred language. This requires Azure Cognitive Services integration.

#### Prerequisites

1. An active Azure account
2. Azure Cognitive Services Text Translation API key
3. Administrator access to your Tallyfy organization

#### Configure Azure Cognitive Services

1. Create an Azure Cognitive Services resource:
   - Log in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
   - Search for "Translator" service
   - Click **Create**
   - Select your subscription, resource group, region, and pricing tier
   - Click **Review + create**, then **Create**

2. Get your API key:
   - Once deployment completes, go to your Translator resource
   - Navigate to **Keys and Endpoint** in the left menu
   - Copy **Key 1** and note your **Location/Region**

#### Connect Azure to Tallyfy

1. In Tallyfy, go to **Settings > Integrations > Translation**
2. Enter the following information:
   - **API Key**: Paste your Azure Translator key
   - **Region**: Enter your Azure service region
   - **Subscription Key**: Your Azure subscription ID (if required)
3. Click **Save**

#### Using content translation

1. Click the globe icon in the top navigation bar
2. Select your preferred language
3. When the globe icon appears green, it indicates Azure Cognitive Services is connected and translating content
4. All user-created content will now appear in your selected language

:::note[Translation limitations]
Real-time translation works best with standard business language. Highly technical terminology, slang, or industry-specific jargon may not translate perfectly.
