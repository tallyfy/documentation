## Understanding Tallyfy's translation options

Tallyfy helps teams who speak different languages work together in two main ways:

1.  **Interface (UI) Language**: Change the display language for Tallyfy's menus, buttons, and system text.
2.  **Content Translation**: Automatically translate user-written text (like task descriptions or comments) using Microsoft Azure AI. (Requires admin setup).

### Changing your interface language

This changes the language *you* see for Tallyfy's standard interface elements.

<Steps>
1. Click the globe icon (üåê) in the top menu bar.
2. Choose your preferred language from the list.
3. Tallyfy's interface will switch to that language.
</Steps>

Available interface languages include English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Japanese, and more. Contact support if your language isn't listed.

### Setting up automatic content translation (admin task)

This feature translates user-written text in real-time, helping teams collaborate across language barriers. It uses Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services and must be set up by an administrator.

#### Supported languages
This feature supports translation between over 100 languages via Microsoft Azure.

#### What you need

*   An active Microsoft Azure account.
*   An API Key and Region/Location details for the Azure Translator service.
*   Administrator access in Tallyfy.

#### Basic setup steps
*(For detailed Azure steps, see the [Azure setup guide](/products/pro/integrations/azure-translation/how-to-set-up-azure-cognitive-ai-integration/).)*

<Steps>
1.  **In Azure**: Create a "Translator" service resource and get its **API Key** and **Region/Location**.
2.  **In Tallyfy**: Go to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Translation**.
3.  Paste your Azure **API Key** into the API Key field.
4.  Enter your Azure service **region**.
5.  *(Optional)* Enter your Azure Subscription Key (if applicable).
6.  Click **Save**.
</Steps>

Once connected, the globe icon in the top bar lets users select a language for content translation.

### Using content translation (all users)

After an administrator sets up the Azure connection:

<Steps>
1. Click the globe icon (üåê) in the top menu bar.
2. Choose the language you want content translated *into*.
3. If the globe icon appears green, it shows Azure Cognitive Services is connected and translating content.
4. As you view tasks, comments, etc., Tallyfy will automatically translate text written by others into your selected language.
</Steps>

:::note[Translation limitations]
Real-time translation works best with standard business text. Highly technical terms, slang, or specific industry jargon might not translate accurately.
