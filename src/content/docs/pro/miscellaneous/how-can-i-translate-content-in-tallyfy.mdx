## Understanding Tallyfy's Translation Options

Tallyfy helps teams work across different languages in two main ways:

1.  **Interface (UI) Language**: Change the language of Tallyfy's menus, buttons, and built-in text.
2.  **Content Translation**: Automatically translate the text *written by users* (like task descriptions or comments) using Microsoft Azure AI. (Requires setup).

### Changing Your Interface Language

This changes the language *you* see for Tallyfy's menus and buttons.

<Steps>
1. Click the globe icon (üåê) in the top menu bar.
2. Choose the language you prefer from the list.
3. Tallyfy's interface will switch to that language immediately.
</Steps>

Available interface languages include English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Japanese, and several others. Contact support if your language isn't listed.

### Setting Up Automatic Content Translation (Admin Task)

This feature translates user-written text in real-time. It helps teams collaborate even if they write in different languages. It uses Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services and needs to be set up by a Tallyfy Administrator.

#### Supported Languages
This feature supports translation between over 100 languages provided by Microsoft Azure.

#### What you need

1.  An active Microsoft Azure account.
2.  An API Key and Region details for the Azure Translator service.
3.  Administrator access in Tallyfy.

#### Basic Setup Steps
*(For detailed Azure steps, see the [Azure setup guide](/products/pro/integrations/azure-translation/how-to-set-up-azure-cognitive-ai-integration/).)*

<Steps>
1.  **In Azure**: Create a "Translator" service resource and get its **API Key** (Key 1) and **Region/Location**.
2.  **In Tallyfy**: Go to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Translation**.
3.  Paste your Azure **API Key** into the API Key field.
4.  Enter your Azure service **Region**.
5.  *(Optional)* Enter your Azure Subscription Key if needed.
6.  Click **Save**.
</Steps>

Once connected, the globe icon in the top bar allows users to select a language for content translation.

### Using Content Translation (All Users)

After the Azure connection is set up:

<Steps>
1. Click the globe icon (üåê) in the top menu bar.
2. Choose the language you want user content translated *into*.
3. If the globe icon appears green, it indicates Azure Cognitive Services is connected and translating content.
4. As you view tasks, comments, etc., Tallyfy will automatically translate the text written by others into your selected language.
</Steps>

:::note[Translation limitations]
Real-time translation works best with standard business language. Highly technical terminology, slang, or industry-specific jargon may not translate accurately.
