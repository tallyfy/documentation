## Translation options in Tallyfy

Tallyfy offers two translation features:

1.  **Interface language** - Change the display language for menus, buttons, and system text
2.  **Content translation** - Translate user-generated text using Microsoft Azure AI (requires admin setup)

See [global workplace language requirements](/products/pro/integrations/azure-translation/global-workplace-language-requirements/) to understand which countries mandate or recommend translation of process content like SOPs and employee handbooks.

### Change interface language

<Steps>
1. Click the globe icon in the top menu bar.
2. Select your preferred language from the list.
3. The interface switches to your selected language.
</Steps>

### Available interface languages

Tallyfy supports English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Japanese, and others.

### Administrator setup for content translation

Content translation uses Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services and supports 100+ languages.

#### Requirements

*   Active Microsoft Azure account with translation services enabled
*   API Key and Region/Location credentials for the Azure Translator service
*   Administrator access in your Tallyfy organization

#### Configuration steps
*(See the [Azure setup guide](/products/pro/integrations/azure-translation/how-to-set-up-azure-cognitive-ai-integration/) for detailed Azure configuration.)*

<Steps>
1.  **Azure configuration** - Create a "Translator" service resource and obtain the **API Key** and **Region/Location** credentials.
2.  **Tallyfy configuration** - Go to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Translation** in your organization settings.
3.  **API key entry** - Paste your Azure **API Key** into the API Key field.
4.  **Region configuration** - Enter your Azure service **region** identifier.
5.  **Optional** - Enter your Azure Subscription Key if applicable.
6.  **Activation** - Click **Save** to finish setup.
</Steps>

### User access after setup

Once configured, users select their language via the globe icon.

### Using content translation

<Steps>
1. Click the globe icon in the top menu bar.
2. Select the target language you want content translated into.
3. A green globe icon means Azure Cognitive Services is connected and actively translating.
4. Tallyfy translates text from other users into your selected language.
</Steps>

:::note[Translation limitations]
Real-time translation works best with standard business text. Highly technical terms, slang, or industry jargon might not translate accurately.

**RTL (Right-to-Left) support** - Tallyfy doesn't currently support RTL languages like Arabic or Hebrew for interface display. Content can be translated to these languages, but the layout stays left-to-right. Full RTL support is under consideration for future development.
