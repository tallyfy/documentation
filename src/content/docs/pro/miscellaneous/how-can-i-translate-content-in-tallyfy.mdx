## Translation options in Tallyfy

Tallyfy offers two translation features:

1.  **Interface Language**: Change the display language for menus, buttons, and system text
2.  **Content Translation**: Translate user-generated text using Microsoft Azure AI (requires administrator setup)

See [global workplace language requirements](/products/pro/integrations/azure-translation/global-workplace-language-requirements/) to understand which countries mandate or recommend translation of process content like SOPs and employee handbooks.

### Change interface language

<Steps>
1. Click the globe icon (🌐) located in the top menu bar.
2. Select your preferred language from the available language list.
3. The interface switches to your selected language.
</Steps>

### Available interface languages

Tallyfy supports English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Japanese, and others.

### Administrator setup for content translation

Content translation uses Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services. Supports over 100 languages.

#### Requirements

*   Active Microsoft Azure account with translation services enabled
*   API Key and Region/Location credentials for the Azure Translator service
*   Administrator-level access within your Tallyfy organization

#### Configuration steps
*(See the [Azure setup guide](/products/pro/integrations/azure-translation/how-to-set-up-azure-cognitive-ai-integration/) for detailed Azure configuration.)*

<Steps>
1.  **Azure Configuration**: Create a "Translator" service resource and obtain the **API Key** and **Region/Location** credentials.
2.  **Tallyfy Configuration**: Navigate to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Translation** within your organization settings.
3.  **API Key Entry**: Paste your Azure **API Key** into the designated API Key field.
4.  **Region Configuration**: Enter your Azure service **region** identifier.
5.  **Optional Setup**: Enter your Azure Subscription Key if applicable to your configuration.
6.  **Activation**: Click **Save** to complete the translation service setup.
</Steps>

### User access after setup

Once configured, users select their language via the globe icon.

### Using content translation

<Steps>
1. Click the globe icon (🌐) in the top menu bar.
2. Select the target language you want content translated into.
3. Green globe icon indicates Azure Cognitive Services is connected and actively translating content.
4. Tallyfy translates text from other users into your selected language.
</Steps>

:::note[Translation limitations]
Real-time translation works best with standard business text. Highly technical terms, slang, or specific industry jargon might not translate accurately.

**RTL (Right-to-Left) support**: Tallyfy currently does not support RTL languages like Arabic or Hebrew for interface display. While content can be translated to these languages, the layout remains left-to-right. Full RTL support is under consideration for future development.
