## How can I share screenshots and screencasts with Tallyfy support?

Sending a picture (screenshot) or a short video recording (screencast) of the issue you're experiencing can help the Tallyfy support team understand the problem faster and more accurately.

Here's how to capture these effectively:

### How do I take screenshots?

*   **On a Mac**: Press `Shift + Command (âŒ˜) + 3` keys together to capture your entire screen. (Other combinations like `Shift + Command + 4` let you select a specific area).
*   **On Windows**: Press the `PrtScn` (Print Screen) key (you might need to press `Fn` or `Ctrl` simultaneously on some keyboards). This usually copies the screen image to your clipboard. You can then paste it into an image editor (like Paint) or directly into your support message. Some Windows versions also have a Snipping Tool for easier, more precise captures.

### How do I record screencasts (screen videos)?

If the issue involves multiple steps or something moving on the screen, a short video is often more effective. Here are some excellent free tools you can use:

*   **Loom**: [https://www.useloom.com/](https://www.useloom.com/) (User-friendly, popular Chrome extension)
*   **Screencastify**: [https://www.screencastify.com](https://www.screencastify.com/) (Also a widely-used Chrome extension)
*   **Recordit**: [http://recordit.co/](http://recordit.co/) (Simple, straightforward tool for quick screen recordings)

These tools allow you to record your screen (and optionally your voice narration) and easily share a video link with the support team for clearer communication.
