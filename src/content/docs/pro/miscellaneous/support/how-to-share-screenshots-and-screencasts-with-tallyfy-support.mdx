## Sharing Screenshots and Screencasts with Tallyfy Support

Sending a picture (screenshot) or a short video recording (screencast) of the problem you're seeing can really help the Tallyfy Support team understand the issue faster.

Here's how to capture them:

### Taking Screenshots

*   **On a Mac**: Press `Shift + Command (âŒ˜) + 3` keys together to take a picture of your whole screen. (Other combinations like `Shift + Command + 4` let you select a specific area).
*   **On Windows**: Press the `PrtScn` (Print Screen) key (you might need to press `Fn` or `Ctrl` at the same time on some keyboards). This usually copies the screen to your clipboard, and you can paste it into an image editor (like Paint) or directly into your support email/ticket. Some versions of Windows also have a Snipping Tool for easier captures.

### Recording Screencasts (Screen Videos)

If the problem involves multiple steps or something moving, a short video recording is often best. Here are some free tools you can use:

*   **Loom**: [https://www.useloom.com/](https://www.useloom.com/) (Easy to use, often added as a Chrome extension)
*   **Screencastify**: [https://www.screencastify.com](https://www.screencastify.com/) (Another popular Chrome extension)
*   **Recordit**: [http://recordit.co/](http://recordit.co/) (Simple tool for quick recordings)

These tools let you record your screen (and sometimes your voice) and easily share a link to the video with the support team.
