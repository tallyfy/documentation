## Sharing screenshots and screencasts with Tallyfy support

Sending a picture (screenshot) or a short video recording (screencast) of the issue you're experiencing can help the Tallyfy support team understand the problem faster.

Here's how to capture these:

### Taking screenshots

*   **On a Mac**: Press `Shift + Command (âŒ˜) + 3` keys together to capture your entire screen. (Other combinations like `Shift + Command + 4` let you select an area).
*   **On Windows**: Press the `PrtScn` (Print Screen) key (you might need to press `Fn` or `Ctrl` simultaneously on some keyboards). This usually copies the screen image to your clipboard. You can then paste it into an image editor (like Paint) or directly into your support message. Some Windows versions also have a Snipping Tool for easier captures.

### Recording screencasts (screen videos)

If the issue involves multiple steps or something moving on the screen, a short video is often better. Here are some free tools you can use:

*   **Loom**: [https://www.useloom.com/](https://www.useloom.com/) (Easy to use, popular Chrome extension)
*   **Screencastify**: [https://www.screencastify.com](https://www.screencastify.com/) (Also a popular Chrome extension)
*   **Recordit**: [http://recordit.co/](http://recordit.co/) (Simple tool for quick screen recordings)

These tools let you record your screen (and optionally your voice) and easily share a video link with the support team.
