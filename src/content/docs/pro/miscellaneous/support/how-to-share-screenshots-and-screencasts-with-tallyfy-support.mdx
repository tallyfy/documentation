## Sharing screenshots and screencasts with support

A screenshot or short screen recording of your issue helps the Tallyfy support team understand the problem much faster than a text description alone.

### Taking screenshots

*   **On a Mac** - Press `Shift + Command (⌘) + 3` to capture your entire screen. Use `Shift + Command + 4` to select a specific area instead.
*   **On Windows** - Press the `PrtScn` (Print Screen) key (you might need `Fn` or `Ctrl` on some keyboards). This copies the screen to your clipboard, so you can paste it into Paint or directly into your support message. You can also use the built-in Snipping Tool for more precise captures.

### Recording screencasts

If the issue involves multiple steps or something moving on screen, a short video works better. Here are some free tools:

*   **Loom**: [https://www.useloom.com/](https://www.useloom.com/) - popular Chrome extension
*   **Screencastify**: [https://www.screencastify.com](https://www.screencastify.com/) - another widely-used Chrome extension
*   **Recordit**: [http://recordit.co/](http://recordit.co/) - quick and simple screen recordings

These tools let you record your screen (and optionally your voice) and share a video link with the support team.
