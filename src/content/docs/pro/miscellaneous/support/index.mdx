## How can I get support and help my team use Tallyfy?

This comprehensive section covers how to get help from Tallyfy and offers proven tips to encourage your team to adopt and use Tallyfy effectively.

### How can I drive successful workflow adoption?

Getting your team to successfully adopt a new tool like Tallyfy takes strategic planning. Here are proven tips based on our adoption best practices guide:

*   **Involve users early**: Talk to the people who'll use the processes day-to-day as you set them up
*   **Start with valuable processes**: Choose initial processes that solve real problems or quickly save time
*   **Get manager buy-in**: Ensure leaders visibly use and support Tallyfy
*   **Share success stories**: Encourage team members to share how Tallyfy is helping them
*   **Plan the rollout**: Don't just launch it; have a solid plan for introducing it

#### How can I automatically onboard new team members?

A great way to help new hires learn Tallyfy and company processes is to automatically launch an onboarding template for them when they join. This approach works because it gives real-time guidance instead of relying on memory, which fails due to the forgetting curve.

- **How**: In **Settings > Organization > Customization**, choose a template under **Auto-Launch Template for New Members**
- **Benefit**: Every new [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) is automatically assigned [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) that guide them through learning Tallyfy and key company procedures

#### How can I use universal snippets for guidance?

Snippets are reusable text blocks. You can set up special "Universal Snippets" in **Settings > Organization > Personalization** to show messages in specific places:

1.  **Guest View Snippets**: Show custom messages to external [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) when they view tasks
2.  **Member Homepage Snippets**: Display permanent messages on all members' Tallyfy homepages (excellent for announcements or important links)
3.  **New Member Onboarding Snippets**: Show a one-time welcome message only to new members when they first log in
4.  **Light Role Template Editing Snippets**: Show a message if a Light [role](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-do-i-manage-member-permissions-in-tallyfy/) user tries to edit a template (which they can't), explaining why

Using these strategic snippets helps guide users through their Tallyfy experience effectively.

#### How can I measure workflow adoption success?

How do you know if people are successfully adopting Tallyfy?
- Look at usage statistics and metrics (if available)
- Check if processes are completed faster or more consistently
- Ask your team for regular feedback and suggestions
- Monitor if there's less email about process coordination
