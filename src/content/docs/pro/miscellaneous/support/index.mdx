## Getting Support and Helping Your Team Use Tallyfy

This section covers how to get help from Tallyfy and offers tips for encouraging your team to adopt and use the platform effectively.

### Driving adoption of Tallyfy

Getting your team to successfully use a new tool like Tallyfy takes some planning. Here are some tips based on our [adoption best practices guide](https://tallyfy.com/adopting-workflow-software/):

*   **Involve users early**: Talk to the people who will actually use the processes day-to-day as you set things up.
*   **Start with valuable processes**: Pick initial processes that solve real problems or save time quickly.
*   **Get manager buy-in**: Make sure leaders use and support Tallyfy visibly.
*   **Share success stories**: Encourage team members to share how Tallyfy helps them.
*   **Plan the rollout**: Don't just turn it on; have a plan for introducing it to different teams.

#### Automatically Onboard New Team Members

A great way to help new hires learn Tallyfy and your processes is to automatically launch an onboarding [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) for them when they first join.

- **How**: In **Settings > Organization > Customization**, you can choose a template under **Auto-Launch Template for New Members**.
- **Benefit**: Every new [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) automatically gets assigned [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) that guide them through learning Tallyfy and important company procedures.

#### Use Universal Snippets for Guidance

[Snippets](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/) are reusable text blocks. You can set up special "Universal Snippets" in **Settings > Organization > Personalization** to show helpful messages in specific places:

1.  **Guest View Snippets**: Show custom messages to external [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) when they view tasks.
2.  **Member Homepage Snippets**: Display permanent messages on all members' Tallyfy homepages (good for announcements or key links).
3.  **New Member Onboarding Snippets**: Show a one-time welcome message only to new members when they first log in.
4.  **Light Role Template Editing Snippets**: Show a helpful message if a Light [role](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-do-i-manage-member-permissions-in-tallyfy/) user tries to edit a template (which they can't do), explaining why.

Using these helps guide users within the Tallyfy interface.

#### Measuring success

How do you know if people are adopting Tallyfy?
- Look at usage stats (if available).
- Check if processes are being completed faster or more consistently.
- Ask your team for feedback.
- See if there's less email back-and-forth for process coordination.
