## Getting support and helping your team use Tallyfy

This section covers how to get help from Tallyfy and offers tips to encourage your team to adopt and use Tallyfy effectively.

### Driving adoption of Tallyfy

Getting your team to successfully adopt a new tool like Tallyfy takes planning. Here are tips based on our [adoption best practices guide](https://tallyfy.com/adopting-workflow-software/):

*   **Involve users early**: Talk to the people who will use the processes day-to-day as you set them up.
*   **Start with valuable processes**: Choose initial processes that solve real problems or quickly save time.
*   **Get manager buy-in**: Ensure leaders visibly use and support Tallyfy.
*   **Share success stories**: Encourage team members to share how Tallyfy is helping them.
*   **Plan the rollout**: Don't just launch it; have a plan for introducing it.

#### Automatically onboard new team members

A great way to help new hires learn Tallyfy and company processes is to automatically launch an onboarding [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) for them when they join.

- **How**: In **Settings > Organization > Customization**, choose a template under **Auto-Launch Template for New Members**.
- **Benefit**: Every new [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) is automatically assigned [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) that guide them through learning Tallyfy and key company procedures.

#### Use universal snippets for guidance

[Snippets](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/) are reusable text blocks. You can set up special "Universal Snippets" in **Settings > Organization > Personalization** to show messages in specific places:

1.  **Guest View Snippets**: Show custom messages to external [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) when they view tasks.
2.  **Member Homepage Snippets**: Display permanent messages on all members' Tallyfy homepages (good for announcements or important links).
3.  **New Member Onboarding Snippets**: Show a one-time welcome message only to new members when they first log in.
4.  **Light Role Template Editing Snippets**: Show a message if a Light [role](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-do-i-manage-member-permissions-in-tallyfy/) user tries to edit a template (which they can't), explaining why.

Using these helps guide users.

#### Measuring success

How do you know if people are adopting Tallyfy?
- Look at usage statistics (if available).
- Check if processes are completed faster or more consistently.
- Ask your team for feedback.
- See if there's less email about process coordination.
