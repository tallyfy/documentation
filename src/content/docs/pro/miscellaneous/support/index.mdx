## Driving Adoption of Tallyfy

Successful implementation of Tallyfy requires thoughtful planning to ensure strong user adoption across your organization. Here are proven strategies to maximize engagement, based on our [adoption best practices](https://tallyfy.com/adopting-workflow-software/):

### Key Adoption Principles

- **Involve actual process users early** - Engage the people who will use Tallyfy daily in the implementation process to create a sense of ownership
- **Choose strategic initial processes** - Start with processes that deliver clear value and quick wins to demonstrate Tallyfy's benefits
- **Lead from the top** - Ensure management visibly uses and champions the platform to signal its importance
- **Encourage peer success stories** - Let users share authentic experiences rather than relying solely on formal communications
- **Plan your rollout carefully** - Work with our team to create a structured implementation plan tailored to your organization

### Automated Onboarding for New Members

One of the most effective ways to increase adoption is to create a standardized onboarding experience for new team members. Tallyfy offers an automated template launch feature that can be configured in **Settings > Organization > Customization**:

- **Auto-Launch Template for New Members** - Select a template that will automatically launch for every new member that joins your organization, creating a custom, multi-step onboarding and self-driven training process
- **Guided Experience** - New members immediately receive tasks that guide them through learning the platform and your organization's processes
- **Consistent Training** - Ensure all new members receive identical onboarding information and complete the same training steps
- **Increased Early Adoption** - By engaging users with actual tasks from day one, they develop platform familiarity quickly

Learn more about this feature in [Auto-launch templates for new members](/products/pro/settings/org-settings/how-to-auto-launch-templates-for-new-members/).

### Universal Snippets for Adoption

Tallyfy offers powerful personalization tools called "Universal Snippets" that help drive adoption by providing contextual guidance. Administrators can configure these in **Settings > Organization > Personalization**:

1. **Guest View Snippets** - Create custom content that all guests see when viewing their tasks, providing context and guidance for external collaborators
2. **Member Homepage Snippets** - Set permanent snippets that appear on all members' homepages, perfect for announcements, tips, or company resources
3. **New Member Onboarding Snippets** - Configure one-time messages that only display when a new member first joins Tallyfy, ideal for welcome information and initial training
4. **Light Role Template Editing Snippets** - Add explanatory messages that appear when users in Light roles attempt to edit or create templates (which they cannot do), clarifying permissions and redirecting them appropriately

These customizable snippets allow you to embed your organization's guidance directly into the user experience, accelerating adoption and reducing support needs.

### Measuring Adoption Success

Monitor adoption metrics through:
- User activity and engagement statistics
- Process completion rates 
- Feedback from team members
- Reduced email volume for process coordination
- Faster process completion times
