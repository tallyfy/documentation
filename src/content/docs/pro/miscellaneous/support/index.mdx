## How can I get support and help my team adopt Tallyfy?

This comprehensive section covers how to get help from Tallyfy and offers proven strategies to drive successful workflow adoption across your organization.

### Five essential strategies for workflow adoption

Getting your team to successfully adopt Tallyfy requires thoughtful planning and execution. These battle-tested strategies help organizations achieve high adoption rates:

#### 1. Involve people early and create ownership

Talk to the people who'll actually use the processes day-to-day as you set them up. When team members participate in designing workflows, they develop a sense of ownership that naturally drives adoption. This approach transforms potential skeptics into champions.

#### 2. Select your initial processes strategically

Start with processes that:
*   Solve immediate, visible pain points
*   Save significant time within the first week
*   Affect multiple departments (to create cross-functional wins)
*   Are currently causing the most frustration or errors

Avoid starting with complex, rarely-used processes - quick wins build momentum.

#### 3. Leadership must lead by example

Managers and executives need to actively use Tallyfy themselves - not just mandate it. When leaders visibly complete tasks, comment on processes, and reference Tallyfy in meetings, it signals that this isn't just another tool that will be abandoned.

#### 4. Enable authentic peer sharing

Encourage team members to share genuine experiences about how Tallyfy helps them. These organic testimonials carry more weight than any top-down communication. Create channels for users to:
*   Share time-saving discoveries
*   Celebrate process improvements
*   Help colleagues with tips and tricks

#### 5. Plan your pilot and rollout systematically

Don't just launch Tallyfy - architect a phased approach:
*   **Pilot phase**: Start with one enthusiastic team or department
*   **Expansion phase**: Roll out to adjacent teams who interact with the pilot group
*   **Organization-wide phase**: Scale based on proven success patterns
*   **Optimization phase**: Continuously refine based on usage data and feedback

#### How can I automatically onboard new team members?

A great way to help new hires learn Tallyfy and company processes is to automatically launch an onboarding template for them when they join. This approach works because it gives real-time guidance instead of relying on memory, which fails due to the forgetting curve.

- **How**: In **Settings > Organization > Customization**, choose a template under **Auto-Launch Template for New Members**
- **Benefit**: Every new [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) is automatically assigned [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) that guide them through learning Tallyfy and key company procedures

#### How can I use universal snippets for guidance?

Snippets are reusable text blocks. You can set up special "Universal Snippets" in **Settings > Organization > Personalization** to show messages in specific places:

1.  **Guest View Snippets**: Show custom messages to external [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) when they view tasks
2.  **Member Homepage Snippets**: Display permanent messages on all members' Tallyfy homepages (excellent for announcements or important links)
3.  **New Member Onboarding Snippets**: Show a one-time welcome message only to new members when they first log in
4.  **Light Role Template Editing Snippets**: Show a message if a Light [role](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-do-i-manage-member-permissions-in-tallyfy/) user tries to edit a template (which they can't), explaining why

Using these strategic snippets helps guide users through their Tallyfy experience effectively.

#### How can I measure workflow adoption success?

Track these concrete indicators to measure adoption:

**Quantitative metrics**:
- Active user percentage (target: 80%+ logging in weekly)
- Process completion rates and times
- Number of processes created by different team members
- Reduction in process-related emails and meetings

**Qualitative signals**:
- Team members proactively suggesting processes to digitize
- Decreased questions about "how to do X"
- Positive mentions in team meetings
- Requests for advanced features (shows engagement)

**Early warning signs of low adoption**:
- Same few people creating all processes
- Processes started but not completed
- Reverting to old methods despite having Tallyfy processes
- No organic discussion about the tool

#### What makes Tallyfy easier to adopt than other tools?

Tallyfy's adoption advantages stem from its design philosophy:

*   **2-minute learning curve**: Most users understand the basics immediately
*   **No technical knowledge required**: Anyone can create and modify processes
*   **Mobile-first design**: Works seamlessly on any device
*   **AI assistance**: Generate process templates in seconds
*   **Legendary support**: Real humans help with adoption challenges
*   **No complex setup**: Start getting value from day one
