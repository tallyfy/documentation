## Where to find the in-app user guide

Tallyfy provides an integrated user guide to help navigate platform features. The guide can be accessed through two methods:

1. If you are logged into Tallyfy, click on **Help** in the left sidebar. Once you've done that, you can either ask a question directly to our support team or select **Answers** to look at frequently asked questions and even use the search bar at the bottom to find an article that solves your questions.

2. Alternatively, you can click on the arrow next to your name and then choose **Help and FAQs** to directly access our manual.
