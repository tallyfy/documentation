## Where to find the in-app user guide

Tallyfy provides an integrated user guide to help navigate platform features. The guide can be accessed through two methods:

1. If you are logged into Tallyfy, click on **Help** in the left sidebar. Once you've done that, you can either ask a question directly to our support team or select **Answers** to look at frequently asked questions and even use the search bar at the bottom to find an article that solves your questions.
