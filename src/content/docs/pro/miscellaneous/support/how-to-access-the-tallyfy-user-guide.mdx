## Where to find the in-app user guide

Tallyfy has a built-in help system where you can find answers and guides while using the app.

There are two main ways to open it when logged in to Tallyfy:

<Steps>
1.  **Help Button**: Click the **Help** button (often with a **?** icon) near the bottom of the left sidebar.
    *   This opens a panel. Use the `Answers` tab to search help articles, or the `Ask` tab to send a message to support.

2.  **User Menu**: Click your name or profile picture in the top right corner, then choose **Help and FAQs** from the dropdown menu.
    *   This typically opens the main help documentation website in a new tab.
