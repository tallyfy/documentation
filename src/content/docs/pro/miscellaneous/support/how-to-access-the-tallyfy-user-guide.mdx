There are two main ways to open it when logged in to Tallyfy:

<Steps>
1.  **Help Button**: Click the **Help** button (often with a **?** icon) near the bottom of the left sidebar.
    *   This opens a panel. Use the `Answers` tab to search help articles, or the `Ask` tab to send a message to support.
