## Where to find the in-app user guide

Tallyfy includes a built-in help system where you can find answers and guides.

There are two main ways to access it while you're logged into Tallyfy:

<Steps>
1.  **Help Button**: Click the **Help** button (often with a question mark icon) in the bottom of the left sidebar.
    *   This opens a panel where you can search help articles (`Answers` tab) or send a message directly to support.

2.  **User Menu**: Click your name in the top right corner, then choose **Help and FAQs** from the dropdown menu.
    *   This usually takes you directly to the main help documentation site.
