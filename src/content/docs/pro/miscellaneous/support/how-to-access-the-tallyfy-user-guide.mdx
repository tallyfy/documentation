## Finding the in-app user guide

Tallyfy has a built-in user guide so you can find answers and step-by-step guides without leaving the app. There are two ways to access it:

<Steps>
1.  **Sidebar Help button** - Click the **?** icon near the bottom of the left sidebar.
    *   This opens a support panel. Use the `Answers` tab to search help articles, or the `Ask` tab to message our support team directly.
