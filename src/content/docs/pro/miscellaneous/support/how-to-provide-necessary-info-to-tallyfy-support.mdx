## What info does Tallyfy support need?

When you contact support, they'll usually ask for two things to find and fix your issue fast:

1.  **The full URL from your browser** - If your question is about a specific [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), running [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), or [guest task link](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-to-find-a-guest-task-link-in-tallyfy/), copy the *entire* web address from your browser's address bar (starting with `https://go.tallyfy.com/...`) and paste it into your support ticket or email.

2.  **Your Organization ID** - This unique ID helps support locate your account. Find it by going to **Settings** > **Organization** in Tallyfy. Copy the ID shown there and include it in your message. See also: [Find your Tallyfy IDs](/products/pro/miscellaneous/how-to-find-your-tallyfy-ids/).

Including both details lets the support team jump straight to the exact item you're asking about.
