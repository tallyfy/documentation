## What information should I provide to Tallyfy support?

To help the Tallyfy support team understand and resolve your issue quickly, they might ask you for specific information.

Two critical pieces of information they commonly need are:

1.  **The Full URL (Web Address)**: If your question is about a specific [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), running [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), or even a specific [guest task link](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-to-find-a-guest-task-link-in-tallyfy/), please copy the *entire* web address from your browser's address bar (starting with `https://go.tallyfy.com/...`) and paste it into your support ticket or email.

2.  **Your Organization ID**: This unique ID helps support quickly locate your specific account. You can find it by navigating to **Settings** > **Organization** in Tallyfy. Copy the ID displayed there and provide it to support. See also: [Find your Tallyfy IDs](/products/pro/miscellaneous/how-to-find-your-tallyfy-ids/).

Providing these critical details helps the support team locate the exact item you're referring to much faster and more efficiently.
