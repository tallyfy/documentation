## Providing information to Tallyfy support

To help the Tallyfy Support team understand and resolve your issue quickly, they might ask you for specific information.

Two common pieces of information they need are:

1.  **The Full URL (Web Address)**: If your question is about a specific [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), running [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), or even a specific [guest task link](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-to-find-a-guest-task-link-in-tallyfy/), please copy the *entire* web address from your browser's address bar (starting with `https://go.tallyfy.com/...`) and paste it into your support ticket or email.

2.  **Your Organization ID**: This unique ID helps support find your specific account. You can find it by going to **Settings** > **Organization** in Tallyfy. Copy the ID displayed there and provide it to support. See also: [Find your Tallyfy IDs](/products/pro/miscellaneous/how-to-find-your-tallyfy-ids/).

Providing these details helps the support team locate the exact item you're referring to much faster.
