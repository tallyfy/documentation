## How to provide specific information to the Tallyfy support team

If you need help from Tallyfy Support, there are a few things they may ask you to provide.

First, they may ask you to share the full URL link of the guest task, process, or template you are referring to. To do this, simply copy-paste the URL and share it with the support team.

Additionally, they may ask you to provide your Organization ID. You can find this by going to Settings > Organization in your Tallyfy account. Once you're there, simply locate your Organization ID and share it with the support team. There's a dedicated tutorial on where to find your organization ID [here.](/products/pro/miscellaneous/how-to-find-your-tallyfy-ids/)
