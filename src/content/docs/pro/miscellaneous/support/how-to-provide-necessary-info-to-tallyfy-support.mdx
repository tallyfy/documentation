## How to provide information requested by support

If you need help from Tallyfy Support, there are a few things they may ask you to provide.

First, they may ask you to share the full URL link of the [guest task](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-to-find-a-guest-task-link-in-tallyfy/), [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), or [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) you are referring to. To do this, copy-paste the URL and share it with the support team.

Additionally, they may ask you to provide your [Organization ID](/products/pro/miscellaneous/how-to-find-your-tallyfy-ids/). You can find this by going to **Settings > Organization** in your Tallyfy account. Once you\'re there, locate your Organization ID and share it with the support team. There\'s a dedicated tutorial on where to find your organization ID [here.](/products/pro/miscellaneous/how-to-find-your-tallyfy-ids/)
