## How to troubleshoot Tallyfy email delivery issues

If you or your [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) aren't receiving emails from Tallyfy, try these troubleshooting steps:

<Steps>
1. **Check your email address (or your guest's).** Make sure emails are sent to the correct, current address.

2. **Check your notification settings on Tallyfy.** Go to `Settings > My Profile > Email Notifications` to choose which emails you want to receive.

3. **Check your spam/junk folders.** Tallyfy emails might be filtered there. If you find one, mark it as 'Not spam/junk' so future emails go directly to your inbox.

4. **Get your IT team involved.** Ask your IT team to allowlist all emails from our domain name: `tallyfy.com`. This ensures Tallyfy emails aren't blocked by company spam filters.

5. **Check quarantine systems.** Make sure your company's quarantine or spam detection systems aren't blocking Tallyfy emails. IT can help set up these systems to allowlist `tallyfy.com`.

6. **Avoid disposable email addresses.** Emails from Tallyfy might be blocked or filtered by temporary/disposable providers. Use a standard, reliable email provider for best results.

7. **Check if emails are being blocked.** You can use tools like [mail-tester.com](https://www.mail-tester.com/) to check your email server's configuration and identify potential blocking issues.

8. **Share the guest link directly.** Once a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) is assigned to a [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/), you can copy their [guest link](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-to-find-a-guest-task-link-in-tallyfy/) and send it to them directly (e.g., via chat). This way, they can access the task without needing the email notification.
</Steps>

If your IT team needs guidance on allowlisting, here are some resources:

*   [Allowlist in G Suite / Google Workspace](https://support.google.com/a/answer/60751)
*   [Allowlist in Office 365 / Microsoft 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/create-safe-sender-lists-in-office-365)
*   For other email systems, refer to their specific documentation on adding email addresses or domains to a safe sender list (allowlist).
