## Why am I not receiving emails from Tallyfy?

When you or your [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) stop receiving emails from Tallyfy, several factors could be blocking delivery. This comprehensive Tallyfy troubleshooting guide helps resolve email delivery issues and ensures consistent communication.

<Steps>
1. **Verify email addresses are current and correct.** Confirm that emails are being sent to the correct, active email address for you or your guests.

2. **Review your Tallyfy notification preferences.** Navigate to `Settings > My Profile > Email Notifications` to verify which email types you want to receive are enabled.

3. **Search spam and junk mail folders thoroughly.** Tallyfy emails may be automatically filtered into these folders. Mark any found emails as 'Not spam/junk' to improve future delivery.

4. **Request IT team assistance for domain allowlisting.** Ask your IT department to allowlist all emails from the domain `tallyfy.com`. This prevents corporate spam filters from blocking Tallyfy communications.

5. **Verify quarantine systems aren't intercepting emails.** Ensure your organization's quarantine or spam detection systems allow emails from `tallyfy.com`. Your IT team can configure these systems appropriately.

6. **Use reliable email providers instead of disposable addresses.** Temporary or disposable email services often block or filter automated emails from platforms like Tallyfy. Choose established email providers for consistent delivery.

7. **Test email server configuration for blocking issues.** Use diagnostic tools like [mail-tester.com](https://www.mail-tester.com/) to identify potential email server configuration problems that might block Tallyfy emails.

8. **Share guest task links directly as an alternative.** When a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) is assigned to a [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/), copy their [guest link](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-to-find-a-guest-task-link-in-tallyfy/) and send it via direct communication channels like chat or text.
</Steps>

### Where can IT teams find allowlisting configuration guides?

If your IT team needs specific guidance on allowlisting Tallyfy emails, these official resources provide step-by-step instructions:

*   [Allowlist in G Suite / Google Workspace](https://support.google.com/a/answer/60751)
*   [Allowlist in Office 365 / Microsoft 365](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/create-safe-sender-lists-in-office-365)
*   For other email systems, refer to their specific documentation on adding email addresses or domains to a safe sender list (allowlist).

## Troubleshooting Microsoft email systems

Microsoft email systems (Outlook.com, Hotmail, Office 365, Exchange Online) use sophisticated spam filtering that sometimes blocks legitimate emails. Here's how to diagnose and resolve these issues.

### Understanding Microsoft's two email systems

Microsoft operates two separate email infrastructures - understanding which one applies to your situation is critical:

**Consumer services** (Outlook.com, Hotmail, Live, MSN):
- Personal email accounts ending in @outlook.com, @hotmail.com, @live.com, @msn.com
- Sender reputation monitored through SNDS (Smart Network Data Services)
- Users can mark emails as spam or not spam
- Governed by Microsoft's consumer email policies

**Business services** (Office 365, Exchange Online, Microsoft 365):
- Corporate and educational email domains like @yourcompany.com or @university.edu
- Uses Exchange Online Protection (EOP) spam filtering
- Managed by organization IT administrators
- Separate filtering policies and controls

The troubleshooting steps differ significantly depending on which system is blocking your emails.

### For consumer services - Checking sender reputation

If emails aren't reaching Outlook.com or Hotmail addresses, check Tallyfy's sending reputation:

**Microsoft SNDS portal**:
1. Visit [SNDS](https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.com/snds/)<a href="https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.com/snds/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
2. Sign in with a Microsoft Account
3. Request access to Tallyfy's sending IP addresses
4. Check daily traffic light indicators (green = good, yellow = warning, red = blocked)
5. Monitor spam complaint rates and trap hits

**What the indicators mean**:
- Green status: Good sender reputation, emails should deliver normally
- Yellow status: Some issues detected, delivery may be degraded
- Red status: Significant problems, emails likely blocked
- Trap hits above zero: Emails sent to inactive addresses (list hygiene issue)
- Complaint rate above 0.1%: Users marking emails as spam

Note that SNDS only covers consumer services - it won't help diagnose Office 365 delivery issues.

### For business services - Working with IT administrators

Office 365 and Exchange Online filtering happens at the organization level. Your IT administrator has tools to diagnose why Tallyfy emails aren't arriving:

**Message Trace** (primary diagnostic tool):
Your IT admin can run Message Trace in the Exchange Admin Center to see:
- Whether Tallyfy emails reached Microsoft servers
- Spam Confidence Level (SCL) scores assigned to emails
- Specific filtering rules that blocked delivery
- Whether emails went to inbox, junk folder, or quarantine

**Typical findings**:
- SCL 5-6: Email marked as spam, delivered to Junk folder
- SCL 7-9: High confidence spam, quarantined or rejected
- Authentication failures: SPF, DKIM, or DMARC checks failed
- Policy blocks: Organization rules preventing delivery

**What IT can do to allow Tallyfy emails**:
1. Add tallyfy.com to the Tenant Allow/Block List
2. Create Mail Flow Rule to bypass spam filtering for Tallyfy
3. Add to organization-wide Safe Senders list
4. Adjust anti-spam policy thresholds
5. Release emails from quarantine and mark as not spam

### Checking authentication status

Microsoft requires proper email authentication (especially after May 2025 for bulk senders). Here's how to verify Tallyfy's authentication is working:

**Using mail-tester.com**:
1. Visit [mail-tester.com](https://www.mail-tester.com/)<a href="https://www.mail-tester.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
2. Note the test email address provided
3. Send a Tallyfy email to that address (create a test task assigned to yourself)
4. Check your score (should be 10/10)
5. Review any authentication issues flagged

**What to look for**:
- SPF record: Should show "pass" for Tallyfy's domain
- DKIM signature: Should be present and valid
- DMARC policy: Should align with SPF and DKIM
- Spam score: Should be low (under 3.0)

If authentication issues appear, contact Tallyfy support - these are infrastructure-level configurations we manage.

### If your IP is blocklisted

Sometimes Microsoft blocklists sending IP addresses due to spam complaints or suspicious activity. Here's how to check and resolve:

**Check blocklist status**:
1. Visit [Microsoft sender support](https://sender.office.com/)<a href="https://sender.office.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
2. Enter the sending IP address (Tallyfy support can provide this)
3. Review blocklist status
4. Submit mitigation request if blocked

**Delist process**:
- Provide detailed explanation of issue resolution
- Wait 24-48 hours for Microsoft review
- Monitor SNDS for reputation improvement
- Consider requesting dedicated sending IP from Tallyfy for isolated reputation

Note: Delisting only works after addressing the root cause (typically spam complaints or sending to invalid addresses).

### Understanding email headers

If you receive a Tallyfy email in your Junk folder, the email headers contain diagnostic information:

**Key headers to review**:
- `X-Forefront-Antispam-Report`: Shows SCL score, SPF/DKIM/DMARC results
- `Authentication-Results`: Detailed authentication check results
- `X-MS-Exchange-Organization-SCL`: Spam confidence level (0-9 scale)
- `Received-SPF`: SPF check pass/fail status

Your IT administrator can extract and interpret these headers through Message Trace or by viewing the email source.

### Preventative measures

Beyond reactive troubleshooting, these practices help maintain good email deliverability:

**For users**:
- Never mark Tallyfy emails as spam - use notification preferences instead
- Add no-reply@tallyfy.com to your personal Safe Senders list
- If using Focused Inbox, move Tallyfy to Focused tab
- Report persistent issues to your IT team promptly

**For IT administrators**:
- Allowlist tallyfy.com domain rather than individual addresses
- Monitor quarantine for false positives
- Review spam policies quarterly
- Document Tallyfy as approved business system
- Consider tenant-wide Mail Flow Rules for critical workflow systems

**For Tallyfy administrators in your organization**:
- Use reliable, permanent email addresses for [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) and [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/)
- Avoid disposable or temporary email services
- Maintain clean lists - remove bounced addresses
- Monitor notification settings to prevent overload
- Test new processes with small user groups first

### When to contact Tallyfy support

Reach out to [Tallyfy support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/) if you experience:

- Emails blocked despite IT allowlisting Tallyfy domain
- Consistent authentication failures in mail-tester.com
- High spam scores (over 5.0) in testing tools
- Widespread delivery issues across multiple organizations
- Blocklist issues that persist after delisting

We can investigate infrastructure-level issues, coordinate with Mailgun (our email provider), and escalate to Microsoft if needed.
