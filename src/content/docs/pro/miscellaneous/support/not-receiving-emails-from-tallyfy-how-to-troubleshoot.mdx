## Why am I not receiving emails from Tallyfy?

When you or your [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) stop receiving emails from Tallyfy, several factors could be blocking delivery. This comprehensive troubleshooting guide helps resolve email delivery issues and ensures consistent communication.

<Steps>
1. **Verify email addresses are current and correct.** Confirm that emails are being sent to the correct, active email address for you or your guests.

2. **Review your Tallyfy notification preferences.** Navigate to `Settings > My Profile > Email Notifications` to verify which email types you want to receive are enabled.

3. **Search spam and junk mail folders thoroughly.** Tallyfy emails may be automatically filtered into these folders. Mark any found emails as 'Not spam/junk' to improve future delivery.

4. **Request IT team assistance for domain allowlisting.** Ask your IT department to allowlist all emails from the domain `tallyfy.com`. This prevents corporate spam filters from blocking Tallyfy communications.

5. **Verify quarantine systems aren't intercepting emails.** Ensure your organization's quarantine or spam detection systems allow emails from `tallyfy.com`. Your IT team can configure these systems appropriately.

6. **Use reliable email providers instead of disposable addresses.** Temporary or disposable email services often block or filter automated emails from platforms like Tallyfy. Choose established email providers for consistent delivery.

7. **Test email server configuration for blocking issues.** Use diagnostic tools like [mail-tester.com](https://www.mail-tester.com/) to identify potential email server configuration problems that might block Tallyfy emails.

8. **Share guest task links directly as an alternative.** When a [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) is assigned to a [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/), copy their [guest link](/products/pro/documenting/guests/how-to-find-a-guest-task-link-in-tallyfy/) and send it via direct communication channels like chat or text.
</Steps>
