## Troubleshoot emails from Tallyfy

If you or your guests are not receiving emails from Tallyfy, try the following troubleshooting steps:

1. **Verify the accuracy of your email address or your guest's email address.** Ensure the email is being sent to the correct address.

2. **Customize your email notifications on Tallyfy.** You can choose which notifications you want to receive to stay informed without being overwhelmed.

3. **Check your spam/junk folders.** Tallyfy emails may be filtered into these folders. If you find our email in the spam/junk folder, mark it as 'Not spam/junk' so that future emails deliver directly to your inbox.

4. **Get your IT team involved.** Ask your IT team to whitelist all emails coming from our parent domain name - tallyfy.com. This ensures that our emails are not blocked by any spam filters. Here are some guides to help you with this process:
    - [Whitelist in G Suite](https://support.google.com/a/answer/60751?hl=en/)
    - [Whitelist in Office 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/securitycompliance/prevent-email-from-being-marked-as-spam/)
    - For other email clients, refer to their specific documentation on adding email addresses to a safe sender list.

5. **Make sure your quarantine or spam detection systems are not blocking Tallyfy emails.** IT can help you configure these systems to whitelist tallyfy.com.

6. **Avoid disposable email providers.** Some email providers are known to be temporary or disposable, and they may block or filter emails from Tallyfy. Use a trusted and reliable email provider to ensure seamless communication.

7. **Check if your email is being blocked.** You can use tools like [mailtester.com](http://mailtester.com/testmail.php/) to check if your email is being blocked by your provider. This will help you identify any issues and take the necessary steps to resolve them.

8. Finally, once a task is assigned to a guest, you can simply **copy the guest link** and share it with them. This way, they can access and view the task without relying solely on email notifications.
