## Troubleshoot emails from Tallyfy

If you or your guests are not receiving emails from Tallyfy, don't worry! We've got you covered. Follow these simple steps to troubleshoot the issue:

1. **Double-check the accuracy of your email address or your guest's email address.** It's always good to ensure that the email is being sent to the right place.

2. **Customize your email notifications on Tallyfy.** You can choose which notifications you want to receive to stay informed without being overwhelmed.

3. **Don't forget to check your spam/junk folders.** Sometimes, our emails may end up there by mistake. If you find our email in the spam/junk folder, make sure to mark it as 'Not spam/junk' so that you receive future emails directly in your inbox.

4. **Get your IT team involved.** Ask your IT team to whitelist all emails coming from our parent domain name - tallyfy.com. This ensures that our emails are not blocked by any spam filters. Here are some guides to help you with this process:
    - [Whitelist in G Suite](https://support.google.com/a/answer/60751?hl=en)
    - [Whitelist in Office 365](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office365/securitycompliance/prevent-email-from-being-marked-as-spam)
    - For other email clients, refer to their specific documentation on adding email addresses to a safe sender list.

5. **Make sure your quarantine or spam detection systems are not blocking Tallyfy emails.** IT can help you configure these systems to whitelist tallyfy.com.

6. **Avoid disposable email providers.** Some email providers are known to be temporary or disposable, and they may block or filter emails from Tallyfy. Use a trusted and reliable email provider to ensure seamless communication.

7. **Check if your email is being blocked.** You can use tools like [mailtester.com](http://mailtester.com/testmail.php) to check if your email is being blocked by your provider. This will help you identify any issues and take the necessary steps to resolve them.

8. Finally, once a task is assigned to a guest, you can simply **copy the guest link** and share it with them. This way, they can access and view the task without relying solely on email notifications.

We hope these steps help you resolve any email delivery issues with Tallyfy. If you need any further assistance, feel free to reach out to our support team. Happy Tallyfying! ðŸ˜Š
