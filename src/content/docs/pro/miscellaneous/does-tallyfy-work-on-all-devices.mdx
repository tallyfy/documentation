## Using Tallyfy on Mobile devices

Tallyfy features a responsive design, ensuring that you can use it seamlessly on any device with a web browser, including tablets, mobile phones, and desktops. Its adaptive interface automatically adjusts to different screen sizes and resolutions, providing an optimal user experience no matter where or how you access it.

We don't currently have a native, downloadable app because the web app is already responsive. However - we intend to build one in future for iOS and Android.
