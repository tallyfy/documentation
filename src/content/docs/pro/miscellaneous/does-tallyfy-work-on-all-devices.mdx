## Using Tallyfy on phones and tablets

Tallyfy is designed to work well on any device with a modern web browser, whether it's a desktop computer, tablet, or smartphone.

The Tallyfy website automatically adjusts its layout to fit different screen sizes. This means you get a good experience using Tallyfy on the go without needing to download a separate app.

Currently, there isn't a separate mobile app to download from an app store because the website itself works effectively on mobile devices.
