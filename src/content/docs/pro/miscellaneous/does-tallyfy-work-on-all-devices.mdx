## Device and platform compatibility

Tallyfy works on any device with a modern web browser through responsive web design. This universal compatibility eliminates device-specific restrictions and complex setup requirements.

### Screen size adaptation

The Tallyfy platform automatically adjusts its interface layout to accommodate various screen sizes including desktop computers, tablets, and smartphones. This responsive design ensures optimal user experience across all devices without requiring separate app downloads or installation procedures.

### Mobile and remote access

Mobile accessibility enables productive workflow management while traveling or working remotely. Users maintain complete functionality regardless of device choice, ensuring uninterrupted business process execution from any location.

### No separate mobile app needed

Currently, Tallyfy doesn't provide a separate mobile app for download from app stores because the responsive website functions exceptionally well on mobile devices. This web-based approach ensures immediate access without installation delays, storage requirements, or app store dependencies.

### Desktop app for enhanced productivity

For users who want native desktop integration, Tallyfy offers a desktop app for macOS, Windows, and Linux. The desktop app provides:

- **Native notifications** that work even when your browser is closed
- **System tray integration** for quick access
- **Seamless OAuth login** using your existing Chrome browser sessions
- **Auto-updates** to always have the latest version
