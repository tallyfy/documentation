## Responsive design and device compatibility

Tallyfy features a responsive design, ensuring that you can use it on any device with a web browser, including tablets, mobile phones, and desktops. Its adaptive interface automatically adjusts to different screen sizes and resolutions, providing a consistent user experience no matter where or how you access it.

We don't currently have a native, downloadable app as the web app is already responsive and works well across all devices.
