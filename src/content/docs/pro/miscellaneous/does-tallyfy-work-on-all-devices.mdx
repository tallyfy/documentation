title: Tallyfy on mobile devices
---

## Device and platform compatibility

Tallyfy works on any device with a modern web browser. It's a responsive web app - so there's nothing to install or configure per device.

### Screen size adaptation

Tallyfy's interface automatically adjusts to fit desktops, tablets, and smartphones. You'll get the same features on every screen size without needing separate app downloads.

### Mobile and remote access

You can manage workflows from anywhere - whether you're traveling or working remotely. All features work the same regardless of which device you're using.

### No separate mobile app needed

Tallyfy doesn't have a separate mobile app in app stores because the responsive web app works great on phones already. You get instant access with no install delays, no storage overhead, and no app store dependencies.

### Desktop app for enhanced productivity

If you want native desktop integration, Tallyfy offers a desktop app for macOS, Windows, and Linux. It provides:

- **Native notifications** that work even when your browser is closed
- **System tray integration** for quick access
- **Automatic OAuth login** using your existing Chrome browser sessions
- **Auto-updates** so you always have the latest version
