Understanding how Tallyfy handles file storage and its limits helps you manage your uploads effectively and decide when to use links to external storage instead.

### File storage in Tallyfy

When using Tallyfy, you might upload files to steps, [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), forms, or comments. All uploaded files are stored securely in Amazon S3 buckets with [security](/products/pro/compliance/) measures.

Here's how it works:

- All PDFs, documents, images, screenshots, audio, and video files you upload count towards your storage limit.
- The default storage location is in the US West region, in the AWS data center in Oregon.
- Your plan determines your storage limit:
    - Docs plan: 5GB total for the organization.
    - Basic plan: 5GB per [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/).
    - Pro plan: 25GB per member.
    - Enterprise plan: Custom limit.

Important points:

- Links to files shared via apps like Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive do **not** count towards your Tallyfy storage limit.
- If you reach your limit, Tallyfy will notify you. You can then:
    - Delete old or unneeded files from Tallyfy.
    - Upgrade your plan for more storage.
    - Soon, you'll have options to bring your own storage (contact support for updates).

For more IT, [compliance](/products/pro/compliance/), and [security](/products/pro/compliance/) details about storage, see our [compliance and security page](https://tallyfy.com/legal/compliance-security/). Data export features vary by plan; contact support for specifics.

### Our recommendation: Use your existing file-sharing platform

Since Tallyfy isn't primarily a file storage tool, we recommend using your company's existing cloud storage for file sharing and permissions. Tools like Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, and Sharepoint work well.

Here are tips for using your existing file storage with Tallyfy:

- **Requesting files**: Create a unique "file request link" in your file-sharing system and share it (e.g., in a task description). Tallyfy won't access files uploaded this way.
- **Linking to files**: Upload files to your usual storage platform, then copy the link to the specific file and paste it into a Tallyfy field (like a text [field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) or task description).

Linking to files on your existing service helps avoid using up your Tallyfy storage and lets you use your existing tools effectively.
