## File storage in Tallyfy

Tallyfy stores uploaded files in Amazon S3 with plan-specific storage limits. You can also link to external files from cloud storage services without using your Tallyfy storage quota.

### Storage system

You can upload files to steps, [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), forms, and comments. All uploaded files are stored securely in Amazon S3 buckets[^1] with full data protection.

#### Storage limits by plan

- All uploaded PDFs, documents, images, screenshots, audio, and video files count towards your storage limit
- Default storage location is US West (AWS Oregon)
- Storage limits vary by plan:
    - **Docs plan** - 5GB total organizational storage
    - **Basic plan** - 5GB per [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/)
    - **Pro plan** - 25GB per member
    - **Enterprise plan** - Custom limits based on your needs

#### Storage considerations

- File links from external apps like Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive do **not** count towards your Tallyfy storage limit
- When you're approaching storage limits, Tallyfy notifies you with these options:
    - Delete outdated or unnecessary files
    - Upgrade your plan for more storage
    - Future "bring your own storage" options (contact support for updates)

### Security and compliance

For full IT, [compliance](/products/pro/compliance/), and [security](/products/pro/compliance/) details about file storage, visit the [compliance and security page](https://tallyfy.com/legal/compliance-security/). Data export capabilities vary by plan - contact support for details.

### Recommended approach

Tallyfy focuses on workflow management, not file storage. Use your existing cloud storage (Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, SharePoint) for file management and link those files in Tallyfy workflows. Learn how with [document management integration](mdc:products/pro/integrations/document-management/).

### Tallyfy storage vs external systems

#### When to use Tallyfy file storage

- **Workflow-centric files** - Documents that are part of the process flow and need to be directly accessible within tasks
- **Simple file needs** - When you don't need advanced features like version control or redlining
- **Audit trail tracking** - Files that need to be tracked as part of the process record
- **Smaller file sizes** - Files under the 150MB upload limit

#### When to use external storage (SharePoint, etc.)

- **Document management needs** - When you need redlining, version control, or collaborative editing
- **Regulatory compliance** - Organizations with specific storage requirements (HIPAA, life sciences, etc.)
- **Large file handling** - Videos or large files exceeding the 150MB limit
- **Existing governance** - When you have established DMS policies or approved file systems

#### A hybrid approach works best

Many organizations combine both approaches:
- **Draft documents** - Use external storage links for collaborative work
- **Final documents** - Upload final PDFs to Tallyfy for process completion and archival
- **Process-specific files** - Tallyfy for workflow-critical documents, external storage for supporting materials
- **Sensitive files** - Link to internal file servers for sensitive documents while maintaining workflow tracking

### Technical specs

#### Tallyfy storage

- **Upload limit** - 150MB per file (larger files should use external hosting like Vimeo for videos)
- **Storage allocation** - Plan-specific limits from 5GB total to 25GB per member
- **Security** - Amazon S3 storage with full data protection
- **Access** - Files directly accessible within workflow tasks and processes

#### External storage integration

- **File request integration** - Create unique [file request links](mdc:products/pro/integrations/document-management/file-request-links/) in your file-sharing system and share them in task descriptions. Tallyfy won't access files uploaded through these external requests
- **Direct file linking** - Upload files to your preferred storage platform, then paste the file links into Tallyfy [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) or task descriptions
- **No storage impact** - External file links don't count toward your Tallyfy storage allocation

### Industry patterns

#### Legal services

- **Contract drafts** - SharePoint/Word for redlining and collaboration
- **Final executed contracts** - Upload to Tallyfy for process completion and audit trail
- **Client communications** - External file server links for sensitive documents

#### Healthcare and life sciences

- **Patient files** - HIPAA-compliant external systems with links in Tallyfy
- **Process documentation** - Tallyfy storage for workflow-critical files
- **Regulatory submissions** - Approved DMS systems with reference links

#### Financial services

- **Customer documents** - Internal file servers for compliance
- **Process attachments** - Tallyfy storage for workflow evidence
- **Audit materials** - Document management systems with workflow tracking

### Sensitive data handling

For sensitive information, use external file linking instead of direct uploads. See [how to protect sensitive data in Tallyfy](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/how-can-i-protect-sensitive-data-in-tallyfy/).
