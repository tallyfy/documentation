## File storage in Tallyfy

Tallyfy stores uploaded files in Amazon S3 with plan-specific storage limits. You can also link to external files from cloud storage services without using your Tallyfy storage quota.

### Storage system

Tallyfy enables file uploads to steps, [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), forms, and comments. All uploaded files are stored securely in Amazon S3 buckets with enterprise-grade [security](/products/pro/compliance/) measures and comprehensive data protection.

#### Storage limits by plan

- All uploaded PDFs, documents, images, screenshots, audio, and video files count towards your subscription's storage limit
- Default storage location resides in the US West region within AWS data centers in Oregon
- Storage limits vary by subscription plan:
    - **Docs plan**: 5GB total organizational storage
    - **Basic plan**: 5GB per [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/)
    - **Pro plan**: 25GB per member
    - **Enterprise plan**: Custom storage limits based on organizational requirements

#### Storage considerations

- File links shared through external apps like Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive do **not** count towards your Tallyfy storage limit
- When approaching storage limits, Tallyfy provides notifications with these options:
    - Delete outdated or unnecessary files from Tallyfy
    - Upgrade your subscription plan for additional storage capacity
    - Future "bring your own storage" options (contact support for availability updates)

### Security and compliance

For comprehensive IT, [compliance](/products/pro/compliance/), and [security](/products/pro/compliance/) details about file storage, visit our [compliance and security page](https://tallyfy.com/legal/compliance-security/). Data export capabilities vary by subscription plan; contact support for specific feature availability.

### Recommended approach

Tallyfy focuses on workflow management. Use your existing cloud storage (Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, SharePoint) for file management and link those files in Tallyfy workflows. Learn how to implement this approach with [document management integration](mdc:products/pro/integrations/document-management/).

### Tallyfy storage vs external systems

#### When to use Tallyfy file storage:
- **Workflow-centric files**: Documents that are integral to the process flow and need to be directly accessible within tasks
- **Simple file management needs**: When you don't require advanced document management features like version control or redlining
- **Unified workflow tracking**: Files that need to be tracked as part of the overall process audit trail
- **Smaller file sizes**: Files under the 150MB upload limit that don't require specialized hosting

#### When to use external storage (SharePoint, etc.):
- **Document management requirements**: When you need features like redlining, version control, or collaborative editing
- **Regulatory compliance**: Organizations with specific document storage requirements (HIPAA, life sciences, etc.)
- **Large file handling**: Videos or large files exceeding the 150MB limit
- **Existing document governance**: When you have established DMS policies or approved file systems
- **Advanced file features**: Word documents requiring tracked changes or specialized document workflows

#### Hybrid approaches work best:
Many organizations successfully combine both approaches:
- **Draft documents**: Start with external storage links for collaborative work
- **Final documents**: Upload final PDFs to Tallyfy for process completion and archival
- **Process-specific files**: Use Tallyfy for workflow-critical documents, external storage for supporting materials
- **Security-sensitive files**: Link to internal file servers for sensitive documents while maintaining workflow tracking

### Technical specifications

#### Tallyfy Storage Specifications:
- **Upload limit**: 150MB per file (larger files should use external hosting like Vimeo for videos)
- **Storage allocation**: Plan-specific limits from 5GB total to 25GB per member
- **Security**: Enterprise-grade Amazon S3 storage with comprehensive data protection
- **Integration**: Files directly accessible within workflow tasks and processes

#### External Storage Integration:
- **File Request Integration**: Create unique [file request links](mdc:products/pro/integrations/document-management/file-request-links/) in your file-sharing system and share them within task descriptions. Tallyfy won't access files uploaded through these external requests
- **Direct File Linking**: Upload files to your preferred storage platform, then copy specific file links and paste them into Tallyfy fields (including text [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) or task descriptions)
- **Link preservation**: External file links don't count toward your Tallyfy storage allocation

### Industry patterns

#### Legal Services:
- **Contract drafts**: SharePoint/Word for redlining and collaboration
- **Final executed contracts**: Tallyfy upload for process completion and audit trail
- **Client communications**: External file server links for sensitive documents

#### Healthcare/Life Sciences:
- **Patient files**: HIPAA-compliant external systems with links in Tallyfy
- **Process documentation**: Tallyfy storage for workflow-critical files
- **Regulatory submissions**: Approved DMS systems with reference links

#### Financial Services:
- **Customer documents**: Internal file servers for compliance
- **Process attachments**: Tallyfy storage for workflow evidence
- **Audit materials**: Document management systems with workflow tracking


### Sensitive data handling

For sensitive information, use external file linking instead of direct uploads. See [how to protect sensitive data in Tallyfy](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/how-can-i-protect-sensitive-data-in-tallyfy/).
