### File storage in Tallyfy

When using Tallyfy, you may need to upload files to steps, [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), forms, or comments. All files are stored in Amazon S3 bucket with [security](/products/pro/compliance/) measures in place.

Here's what you need to know about file storage in Tallyfy:

- All PDFs, documents, images, screenshots, audio, and video files that you upload count towards your storage limit.
- The default storage location is in the US West at the AWS data center in Oregon.
- Depending on your plan, you have different storage limits:
  - Docs: 5GB for the entire organization.\n
  - Basic: 5GB per [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/).\n
  - Pro: 25GB per member.\n
  - Enterprise: Custom storage limit.

Important considerations:

- URL links shared via apps like Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive do not count towards your storage limit.
- If you reach your storage limit, you will be notified and can:
  - Delete unnecessary files.
  - Upgrade your plan for more space.
  - Soon, you'll be able to bring your storage.

For more details on IT, [compliance](/products/pro/compliance/), and [security](/products/pro/compliance/) related to storage, check out our [compliance and security page](https://tallyfy.com/legal/compliance-security/). Export features are available on different plans; contact support for more information.

### Our recommendation: Use your existing file-sharing platform

Since Tallyfy is not a dedicated file storage and file-syncing tool, it is recommended to use your current cloud-based filesystem for file sharing and permissions. Platforms like Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, and Sharepoint are compatible.

Here are some tips for integrating your file-sharing platform with Tallyfy:

- To request files, you can create a unique "file request link" in most file-sharing systems and share it with others. Tallyfy won't see the files uploaded through this link.
- In other cases, you can specify the folder or path in your file-sharing platform where you want the file to be uploaded. Then, grab the link to the file and paste it into a Tallyfy text [field](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/).

By linking to files on your existing file-sharing service instead of storing them in Tallyfy, you'll keep your storage plan clutter-free and optimize the use of your existing resources.
