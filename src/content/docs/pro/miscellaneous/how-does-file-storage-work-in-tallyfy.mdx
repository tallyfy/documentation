## How does file storage work in Tallyfy?

Understanding how Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> handles file storage, security measures, and plan-specific limits helps you manage uploads effectively and determine when to leverage external storage solutions for optimal efficiency.

### What file storage system does Tallyfy use?

Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> enables file uploads to steps, [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), forms, and comments. All uploaded files are stored securely in Amazon S3 buckets with enterprise-grade [security](/products/pro/compliance/) measures and comprehensive data protection.

#### How does Tallyfy's file storage system operate?

- All uploaded PDFs, documents, images, screenshots, audio, and video files count towards your subscription's storage limit
- Default storage location resides in the US West region within AWS data centers in Oregon
- Storage limits vary by subscription plan:
    - **Docs plan**: 5GB total organizational storage
    - **Basic plan**: 5GB per [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/)
    - **Pro plan**: 25GB per member
    - **Enterprise plan**: Custom storage limits based on organizational requirements

#### What are important storage considerations?

- File links shared through external apps like Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive do **not** count towards your Tallyfy storage limit
- When approaching storage limits, Tallyfy provides notifications with these options:
    - Delete outdated or unnecessary files from Tallyfy
    - Upgrade your subscription plan for additional storage capacity
    - Future "bring your own storage" options (contact support for availability updates)

### Where can I find detailed security and compliance information?

For comprehensive IT, [compliance](/products/pro/compliance/), and [security](/products/pro/compliance/) details about file storage, visit our [compliance and security page](https://tallyfy.com/legal/compliance-security/). Data export capabilities vary by subscription plan; contact support for specific feature availability.

### What file storage approach does Tallyfy recommend?

Since Tallyfy focuses on workflow management rather than file storage, we recommend leveraging your organization's existing cloud storage solutions for comprehensive file sharing and permissions management. Platforms like Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, and SharePoint integrate excellently with Tallyfy workflows.

#### How can I integrate external file storage with Tallyfy?

- **File Request Integration**: Create unique "file request links" in your file-sharing system and share them within task descriptions. Tallyfy won't access files uploaded through these external requests
- **Direct File Linking**: Upload files to your preferred storage platform, then copy specific file links and paste them into Tallyfy fields (including text [fields](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) or task descriptions)

This external linking approach preserves your Tallyfy storage allocation while maximizing the effectiveness of your existing file management tools.

### How can I optimize sensitive data handling?

Since Tallyfy recommends external file linking over direct uploads, particularly for sensitive information, explore comprehensive guidelines on [how to protect sensitive data in Tallyfy](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/how-can-i-protect-sensitive-data-in-tallyfy/) for enhanced security practices.
