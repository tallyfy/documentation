## Becoming a Tallyfy partner

Tallyfy partners with consultants, agencies, and software companies who want to help their clients manage workflows and improve business processes using Tallyfy.

### What partnership types does Tallyfy offer?

- **Solution Partners** - Consultants and agencies who implement Tallyfy for their clients
- **Technology Partners** - Software companies who integrate their products with Tallyfy
- **Referral Partners** - Organizations who refer qualified prospects to Tallyfy

### What benefits do partners receive?

- Earn **rewards** for successfully referred clients
- Option to **provide value-added services** to clients
- Access a **partner dashboard** to track performance
- **Unbilled Domain Access** - your team accesses client accounts without increasing their costs (details below)
- Opportunities for **joint marketing** and collaboration
- **Priority technical support** for partner issues and implementations
- Access to **partner resources and training materials**
- Offer **consulting services** using Tallyfy metrics to improve client processes and deliver measurable ROI

### Unbilled domains for partners

When your team helps clients implement Tallyfy, you shouldn't increase their account costs just for your team's access. Unbilled Domains solves this:

1. The client adds your company's email domain (e.g., `yourconsultancy.com`) to their Tallyfy account exclusion list
2. Anyone accessing the client's Tallyfy account with an email from `@yourconsultancy.com` is automatically marked as "Unbilled"
3. When Tallyfy calculates account usage, it counts only the client's employees - not "Unbilled" partner members

**Practical example:**
- ClientCorp adds `partner.com` to their exclusion list
- ClientCorp has 15 employees (`@clientcorp.com`) and 5 consultants (`@partner.com`) using Tallyfy
- ClientCorp's account counts only their 15 employees - consultants access the system at no extra cost

This means partners can collaborate freely within client accounts without adding to the client's bill.

### What commitments are required?

Partners agree to these program requirements:

- **Active Tallyfy account** - You must maintain an active account that serves as a demo environment for potential customers
- **Agreement compliance** - You must follow the terms in the Tallyfy Referral Agreement, Trademark Usage Guidelines, Customer Terms of Service, and Privacy Policy
- **Active promotion** - You're expected to actively promote Tallyfy through your website and marketing channels
- **Prohibited activities** - Don't associate Tallyfy marketing materials with unlawful, harmful, defamatory, obscene, or offensive content. Sending spam to promote Tallyfy is strictly prohibited
- **Trademark usage** - You must use Tallyfy trademarks, logos, and marketing materials only as specified in the Trademark Usage Guidelines
