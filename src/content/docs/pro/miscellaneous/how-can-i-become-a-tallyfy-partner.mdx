## How to become a Tallyfy partner

Tallyfy offers partnership opportunities for consultants, agencies, and technology providers who want to integrate our workflow management capabilities into their service offerings.

### Partnership types

Tallyfy offers several partnership models:

- **Solution Partners**: Consultants and agencies who implement Tallyfy for their clients
- **Technology Partners**: Software companies that integrate their products with Tallyfy
- **Referral Partners**: Organizations that refer clients to Tallyfy

### Partnership benefits

As a Tallyfy partner, you gain:

- Competitive commission rates on referred business
- Revenue sharing for clients you bring to Tallyfy
- Unbilled domains in client instances (your team members aren't counted in client billing)
- Joint marketing opportunities
- Priority technical support
- Access to partner-specific resources
- Training and certification options

### Unbilled domains for partners

When you refer clients to Tallyfy, your team members can join client organizations without increasing the client's billing costs:

- Partner team members with email addresses from your domain(s) are marked as "Unbilled"
- Only the client's team members are included in billing calculations
- This allows you to provide implementation assistance and support without affecting client costs
- The domain exclusion is configured during initial setup or upon request

#### How domain exclusion works

Domain exclusion is a powerful feature that prevents billing for any member whose email address ends with domains specified in the exclusion list:

1. The client organization administrator adds your domain (e.g., `yourcompany.com`) to their domain exclusion list
2. Any member with an email address ending with that domain (e.g., `consultant@yourcompany.com`) is automatically marked as "Unbilled"
3. At each billing cycle, Tallyfy only counts members whose email domains are not on the exclusion list
4. This makes it cost-effective for clients to invite consultants, partners, or Tallyfy Ambassadors to their organization

#### Example scenario

Here's how domain exclusion works in practice:

* Organization "ClientCorp" has added `partnercompany.com` to their domain exclusion list
* "ClientCorp" has 20 members total:
  * 14 members with `clientcorp.com` email addresses
  * 6 members with `partnercompany.com` email addresses (consultants helping implement Tallyfy)
* At billing time, only the 14 `clientcorp.com` members are counted for billing purposes
* The 6 consultants from `partnercompany.com` are marked as "Unbilled" and don't affect the client's costs

This arrangement benefits both the client and partners - clients don't pay for temporary consultants, and partners can easily collaborate within the client's Tallyfy instance.
