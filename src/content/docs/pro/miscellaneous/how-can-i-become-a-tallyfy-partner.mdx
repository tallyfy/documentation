## How to become a Tallyfy partner

Tallyfy partners with consultants, agencies, and software companies who want to use Tallyfy to help their own clients manage workflows.

### Types of partners

- **Solution Partners**: Consultants/agencies who set up Tallyfy for clients.
- **Technology Partners**: Software companies who connect their product with Tallyfy.
- **Referral Partners**: Companies who send potential clients to Tallyfy.

### Benefits of partnering

- Earn commission for clients you refer.
- Share revenue from clients you bring in.
- **Unbilled Domains**: Your team can access client accounts without adding to the client's bill (see below).
- Opportunities for joint marketing.
- Faster technical support.
- Access to special partner resources and training.

### How "Unbilled Domains" work for partners

When your team helps a client set up or use Tallyfy, you don't want the client to pay extra Tallyfy fees just for your team members' access. Unbilled Domains solves this:

1. The client adds your company's email domain (e.g., `yourconsultancy.com`) to a special exclusion list in their Tallyfy settings.
2. Anyone who logs into the client's Tallyfy account with an email address ending in `@yourconsultancy.com` is automatically marked as "Unbilled".
3. When Tallyfy calculates the client's bill, it only counts the client's own employees, not the "Unbilled" partner members.

**Example:**
- ClientCorp adds `partner.com` to their exclusion list.
- ClientCorp has 15 employees (`@clientcorp.com`) and 5 consultants (`@partner.com`) using their Tallyfy.
- ClientCorp is only billed for their 15 employees.

This allows partners to collaborate fully within the client's account without increasing the client's cost.
