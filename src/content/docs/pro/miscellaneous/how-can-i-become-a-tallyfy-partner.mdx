### How do "Unbilled Domains" work for partners?

When your team helps clients implement Tallyfy, you shouldn't increase their billing costs just for your team's access. Unbilled Domains elegantly solves this challenge:

1. The client adds your company's email domain (e.g., `yourconsultancy.com`) to their Tallyfy billing exclusion list
2. Anyone accessing the client's Tallyfy account with an email address from `@yourconsultancy.com` is automatically marked as "Unbilled"
3. When Tallyfy calculates monthly billing, it counts only the client's employees, excluding all "Unbilled" partner members

**Practical example:**
- ClientCorp adds `partner.com` to their billing exclusion list
- ClientCorp has 15 employees (`@clientcorp.com`) and 5 consultants (`@partner.com`) using Tallyfy
- ClientCorp pays only for their 15 employees, while consultants access the system at no additional cost

This powerful feature enables complete partner collaboration within client accounts without increasing the client's operational expenses.

### What commitments are required for Tallyfy partners?
