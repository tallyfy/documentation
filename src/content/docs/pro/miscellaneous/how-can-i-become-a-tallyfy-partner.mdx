## How can I become a Tallyfy partner?

Tallyfy creates strategic partnerships with consultants, agencies, and software companies seeking to leverage Tallyfy for helping clients effectively manage complex workflows and optimize business processes.

### What partnership types does Tallyfy provide?

- **Referral Partners**: Organizations who refer qualified prospects to Tallyfy

### What benefits do Tallyfy partners receive?

- Option to **provide value-added services** to clients
- Access a **dedicated partner dashboard** to track performance metrics
- **Unbilled Domain Access**: Your team accesses client accounts without increasing the client's account costs (detailed below)

### How do "Unbilled Domains" work for partners?

When your team helps clients implement Tallyfy, you shouldn't increase their account costs just for your team's access. Unbilled Domains elegantly solves this challenge:

1. The client adds your company's email domain (e.g., `yourconsultancy.com`) to their Tallyfy account exclusion list
2. Anyone accessing the client's Tallyfy account with an email address from `@yourconsultancy.com` is automatically marked as "Unbilled"
3. When Tallyfy calculates account usage, it counts only the client's employees, excluding all "Unbilled" partner members

**Practical example:**
- ClientCorp adds `partner.com` to their account exclusion list
- ClientCorp has 15 employees (`@clientcorp.com`) and 5 consultants (`@partner.com`) using Tallyfy
- ClientCorp's account counts only their 15 employees, while consultants access the system at no additional impact

This powerful feature enables complete partner collaboration within client accounts without increasing the client's operational expenses.

### What commitments are required for Tallyfy partners?

To ensure successful partnerships, Tallyfy partners commit to the following program requirements:

- **Active Tallyfy Account**: Partners must maintain an active Tallyfy account serving as a demonstration environment for potential customers
- **Agreement Compliance**: Partners must adhere to terms outlined in the Tallyfy Referral Agreement, Trademark Usage Guidelines, Customer Terms of Service, and Privacy Policy
- **Active Promotion**: Partners are expected to actively promote Tallyfy services through their websites and established marketing channels
- **Prohibited Activities**: Partners cannot associate Tallyfy marketing materials with unlawful, harmful, defamatory, obscene, offensive, or discriminatory content. Sending unsolicited bulk messages (spam) to promote Tallyfy is strictly prohibited
- **Trademark Usage**: Partners must use Tallyfy trademarks, logos, and marketing materials only as specified in Trademark Usage Guidelines and official instructions
