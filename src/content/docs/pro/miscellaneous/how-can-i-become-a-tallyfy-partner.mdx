## How to become a Tallyfy partner

Tallyfy partners with consultants, agencies, and software companies who want to use Tallyfy to help their clients manage workflows.

### Types of partners

- **Solution Partners**: Consultants/agencies who implement Tallyfy for clients.
- **Technology Partners**: Software companies who integrate their product with Tallyfy.
- **Referral Partners**: Companies who refer potential clients to Tallyfy.

### Benefits of partnering

- Earn commission for referred clients.
- Share revenue from referred clients.
- **Unbilled Domains**: Your team can access client accounts without increasing the client's bill (explained below).
- Opportunities for joint marketing.
- Faster technical support.
- Access to partner resources and training.

### How "Unbilled Domains" work for partners

When your team helps a client set up Tallyfy, you don't want the client paying extra just for your team's access. Unbilled Domains addresses this:

1. The client adds your company's email domain (e.g., `yourconsultancy.com`) to an exclusion list in their Tallyfy billing settings.
2. Anyone logging into the client's Tallyfy account with an email address from `@yourconsultancy.com` is marked as "Unbilled".
3. When Tallyfy calculates the bill, it counts only the client's employees, not the "Unbilled" partner members.

**Example:**
- ClientCorp adds `partner.com` to their exclusion list.
- ClientCorp has 15 employees (`@clientcorp.com`) and 5 consultants (`@partner.com`) using Tallyfy.
- ClientCorp is only billed for their 15 employees.

This allows partners to collaborate fully in the client's account without adding to the client's cost.
