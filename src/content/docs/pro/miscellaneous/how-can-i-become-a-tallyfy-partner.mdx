## How to become a Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> partner

Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> partners with consultants, agencies, and software companies who want to use Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> to help their clients manage workflows.

### Types of partners

- **Solution Partners**: Consultants/agencies who implement Tallyfy for clients.
- **Technology Partners**: Software companies who integrate their product with Tallyfy.
- **Referral Partners**: Companies who refer potential clients to Tallyfy.

### Benefits of partnering

- Earn up to **20% revenue share for the first year** on recurring revenue from referred clients.
- Option to **pass on your commission as a discount** to your customers.
- Access a **dedicated dashboard to track your earnings**.
- **Unbilled Domains**: Your team can access client accounts without increasing the client's bill (explained below).
- Opportunities for **joint marketing**.
- **Faster technical support**.
- Access to **partner resources and training**.
- Offer **more services to your clients** by using Tallyfy metrics to continuously improve their processes, delivering long-term ROI.

### How "Unbilled Domains" work for partners

When your team helps a client set up Tallyfy, you don't want the client paying extra just for your team's access. Unbilled Domains addresses this:

1. The client adds your company's email domain (e.g., `yourconsultancy.com`) to an exclusion list in their Tallyfy billing settings.
2. Anyone logging into the client's Tallyfy account with an email address from `@yourconsultancy.com` is marked as "Unbilled".
3. When Tallyfy calculates the bill, it counts only the client's employees, not the "Unbilled" partner members.

**Example:**
- ClientCorp adds `partner.com` to their exclusion list.
- ClientCorp has 15 employees (`@clientcorp.com`) and 5 consultants (`@partner.com`) using Tallyfy.
- ClientCorp is only billed for their 15 employees.

This allows partners to collaborate fully in the client's account without adding to the client's cost.

### Key program commitments

To ensure a successful partnership, Tallyfy partners agree to the following:

- **Active Tallyfy Account**: Partners must maintain a paid Tallyfy account on an annual plan. This account serves as a demonstration environment for potential customers.
- **Agreement Adherence**: Partners must agree to the terms outlined in the Tallyfy Referral Agreement, Trademark Usage Guidelines, Customer Terms of Service, and Privacy Policy.
- **Active Promotion**: Partners are expected to actively promote the Tallyfy Service through their website(s) and other marketing channels.
- **Prohibited Activities**: Partners must not associate Tallyfy marketing materials with unlawful, harmful, defamatory, obscene, offensive, or discriminatory content. Sending unsolicited bulk messages (spam) in promoting Tallyfy is strictly prohibited.
- **Permissible Use of Tallyfy Marks**: Partners must use Tallyfy trademarks, logos, and other marketing materials only as specified in the Trademark Usage Guidelines and other instructions provided by Tallyfy.
