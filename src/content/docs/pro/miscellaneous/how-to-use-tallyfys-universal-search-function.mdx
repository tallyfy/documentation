### What is universal search and how to use it

The 'Universal Search' function in Tallyfy allows you to search for [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), and other related details.

With the universal search, you can search for various attributes related to templates, processes, and tasks.

**Template Search** allows you to search by:

- Template tags
- Template name (title)
- Template description
- Template step name
- Template step descriptions (details tab)

**Process/[Process Task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) Search** allows you to search by:

- Process tags
- [Process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) name (title)
- Process notes
- Process task name
- Process task description
- Process task comments

**One-off Task Search** allows you to search by:

- One-off [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) name (title)
- One-off task comments

Type your search query, and results will include [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), or [snippets](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/). If your templates are stored in multiple folders, the search results will also show the file path to the template's location, assisting navigation.
