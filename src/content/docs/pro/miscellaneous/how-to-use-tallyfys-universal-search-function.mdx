### What is Universal Search and how to use it?

The Universal Search bar at the top of Tallyfy lets you find almost anything in your account â€“ [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), specific [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), and [snippets](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/).

Simply type what you're looking for into the search bar.

**What does it search?**

Universal Search looks through many different places:

*   **For Templates:**
    *   Template tags
    *   Template names (titles)
    *   Template descriptions
    *   Step names within templates
    *   Step descriptions within templates
*   **For Running Processes & Tasks within them:**
    *   Process tags
    *   Process names (titles)
    *   Notes added to processes
    *   Task names within processes
    *   Task descriptions within processes
    *   Comments added to tasks within processes
*   **For One-off Tasks (tasks not part of a process):**
    *   One-off task names (titles)
    *   Comments added to one-off tasks
*   **For Snippets:**
    *   Snippet titles
    *   Snippet content

**Search Results:**

The results list will show matching items. If you search for templates and they are organized into folders, the search result will show the folder path so you know where to find it.

**Sharing Search Results:**

If you want to share a direct link to a specific search result (like a template or process), click the **share icon** next to that result. This copies a unique link to your clipboard that you can send to someone else.
