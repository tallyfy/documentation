### What is universal search and how to use it?

The Universal Search bar at the top of Tallyfy lets you find almost anything â€“ [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), specific [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), and [snippets](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/).

Just type what you're looking for into the search bar.

**What does it search?**

Universal Search looks in many different places:

*   **For Templates:**
    *   Template tags
    *   Template names (titles)
    *   Template descriptions
    *   Step names within templates
    *   Step descriptions within templates
*   **For Running Processes & Tasks:**
    *   Process tags
    *   Process names (titles)
    *   Notes added to processes
    *   Task names within processes
    *   Task descriptions within processes
    *   Comments added to tasks within processes
*   **For One-off tasks (not part of a process):**
    *   One-off task names (titles)
    *   Comments added to one-off tasks
*   **For Snippets:**
    *   Snippet titles
    *   Snippet content

**Search Results:**

The results list will show items that match your search. If you search for templates and they are in folders, the search result will show the folder location so you know where to find it.

**Sharing search results:**

If you want to share a direct link to a result (like a template or process), click the **share icon** next to that result. This copies a link to your clipboard that you can send to others.
