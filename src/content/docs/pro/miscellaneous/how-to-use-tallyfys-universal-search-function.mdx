## How can I use Tallyfy's universal search function?

Tallyfy's universal search bar delivers comprehensive platform-wide search capabilities enabling rapid location of virtually any content including [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), specific [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), and [snippets](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/).
