## Using Tallyfy's universal search

Tallyfy's universal search bar delivers platform-wide search capabilities enabling rapid location of virtually any content including [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), specific [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), and [snippets](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/).

This search feature streamlines workflow navigation by providing instant access to relevant content across your entire Tallyfy workspace.
