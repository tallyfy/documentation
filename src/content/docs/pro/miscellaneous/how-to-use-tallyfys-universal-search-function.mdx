## Using Tallyfy's universal search

Tallyfy's universal search helps you find anything across your workspace - [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), running [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), and [snippets](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/).
