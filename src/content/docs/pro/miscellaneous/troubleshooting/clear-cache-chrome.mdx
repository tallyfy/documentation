2. Click the three-dot menu (⋮) in the top-right corner.
3. Select **Settings**.
4. Click **Privacy and security** in the left sidebar.
5. Click **Clear browsing data**.
6. Set the time range to **All time**.
7. Check **Browsing history**.
8. Check **Cookies and other site data**.
9. Check **Cached images and files**.
10. Click **Clear data**.
</Steps>

Close Chrome completely, then reopen it before going back to Tallyfy. Don't just open a new tab - quit the browser and restart it.
