## Clearing Edge's cache to fix Tallyfy issues

If Tallyfy isn't displaying correctly or feels slow in Microsoft Edge, clearing your browser cache often fixes it. This removes temporary files that may be corrupted or outdated, forcing Edge to download fresh content from Tallyfy's servers.

You can also press **Ctrl+Shift+Delete** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd+Shift+Delete** (Mac) to jump straight to step 5.

<Steps>
1. Open Microsoft Edge.
2. Click the menu button (**⋯**) in the top right corner.
3. Select **Settings**.
4. Click **Privacy, search, and services** in the left sidebar.
5. Under **Clear browsing data**, click **Choose what to clear**.
6. Set the time range to **All time** for a complete cache clear.
7. Check **Browsing history**.
8. Check **Cookies and other site data**.
9. Check **Cached images and files**.
10. Click **Clear now**.
</Steps>

### After clearing Edge's cache

Close Edge completely and reopen it before accessing Tallyfy again. This makes sure all cached data is fully removed.

### Clearing cache for only Tallyfy in Edge

If you'd rather clear data just for Tallyfy without affecting other sites:

<Steps>
1. Go to the Tallyfy website (e.g. `go.tallyfy.com`).
2. Click the lock icon (or site information icon) in the address bar.
3. Click **Cookies and site data**.
4. Find and select the Tallyfy-related entries (such as `go.tallyfy.com`).
5. Click **Remove** to delete them.
6. Reload the page.
</Steps>

### If clearing cache doesn't resolve the issue

If clearing Edge's cache doesn't fix your Tallyfy problems, [contact Tallyfy support](https://tallyfy.com/contact-us/) for further help.
