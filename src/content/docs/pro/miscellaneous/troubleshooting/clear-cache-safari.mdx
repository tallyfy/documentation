## Why clear Safari's cache?

Safari stores temporary files to speed up browsing, but these can become corrupted or outdated - causing loading problems, display glitches, or stale content in Tallyfy. Clearing the cache forces Safari to download fresh files. The steps differ between Mac and iPhone/iPad.

### Clear Safari cache on Mac

<Steps>
1. Open Safari and click **Safari** in the top menu bar.
2. Select **Settings...** from the dropdown.
3. Go to the **Advanced** tab.
4. Check **Show features for web developers** at the bottom.
5. Close Settings.
6. Click **Develop** in the menu bar and select **Empty Caches**.
</Steps>

You can also use the keyboard shortcut **Option + Command + E** to empty caches quickly.

#### Clear all website data

<Steps>
1. Click **Safari** in the menu bar, then select **Settings...**
2. Go to the **Privacy** tab.
3. Click **Manage Website Data...**
4. Click **Remove All**, then confirm by clicking **Remove Now**.
</Steps>

### Clear Safari cache on iPhone or iPad

<Steps>
1. Open the **Settings** app.
2. Scroll down and tap **Safari**.
3. Tap **Clear History and Website Data**.
4. Choose your timeframe (select **All history** for a full clear).
5. Tap **Clear History** to confirm.
</Steps>

### After clearing the cache

Close Safari completely and reopen it before visiting Tallyfy again. This makes sure all old cached data is gone.
