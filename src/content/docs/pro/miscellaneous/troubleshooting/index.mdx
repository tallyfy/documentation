## Images loading slowly?

It might be due to an old machine that is unable to support QUIC or other modern protocols and extensions.

### 1. Disable the QUIC Protocol in Chrome

- Open Chrome and type `chrome://flags` in the address bar
- Search for "Experimental QUIC protocol"
- Change the setting to "Disabled"
- Restart Chrome

### 2. Disable Chrome Extensions

- Navigate to `chrome://extensions`
- Disable all extensions, then restart Chrome
- Re-enable extensions one by one to identify any problematic extensions

### 3. Check Your Firewall and Antivirus

- Temporarily disable your firewall and antivirus software to see if the error persists
- If the error disappears, you may need to configure your firewall or antivirus to allow QUIC traffic
