### Common troubleshooting steps

If Tallyfy isn't working right (e.g., pages not loading, errors appearing), try these common steps first before contacting support:

1.  **Clear your browser's cache**: Old website data can sometimes cause problems. Select your browser below for specific steps:
    *   [Chrome Instructions](/products/pro/miscellaneous/troubleshooting/clear-cache-chrome/)
    *   [Firefox Instructions](/products/pro/miscellaneous/troubleshooting/clear-cache-firefox/)
    *   [Safari Instructions](/products/pro/miscellaneous/troubleshooting/clear-cache-safari/)
    *   [Edge Instructions](/products/pro/miscellaneous/troubleshooting/clear-cache-edge/)
2.  **Try a different web browser**: This helps check if the issue is specific to your usual browser.
3.  **Check your internet connection**: Ensure you have a stable connection.
4.  **Temporarily disable browser extensions**: Add-ons (like ad blockers or privacy tools) can sometimes interfere. Try turning them off one by one.
5.  **Update your browser**: Ensure you're using the latest version of your browser.

### Get the very latest version of Tallyfy (hard refresh)

Sometimes your browser might keep an old version of the Tallyfy web application. A "hard refresh" forces your browser to ignore the saved version and download the very latest code from Tallyfy.

#### How to hard refresh

| Browser   | Windows/Linux             | macOS                     |
|-----------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Chrome    | `Ctrl + F5` or `Ctrl + Shift + R` | `Cmd + Shift + R`         |
| Firefox   | `Ctrl + F5` or `Ctrl + Shift + R` | `Cmd + Shift + R`         |
| Edge      | `Ctrl + F5` or `Ctrl + Shift + R` | `Cmd + Shift + R`         |
| Safari    | (See note below)          | `Cmd + Option + R`        |

*   **Safari Note**: For Safari, you might need to hold `Shift` and click the normal Reload button, or hold `Option` and click Reload, or use the `Cmd + Option + R` shortcut. You can also use the Developer Tools method.
*   **Alternative (Most Browsers)**: Open Developer Tools (`F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` / `Cmd+Option+I`), then right-click the browser's reload button and choose "Empty Cache and Hard Reload".

If a hard refresh doesn't help, try clearing your full browser cache using the links in step 1 above.

### Understanding rate limits

To prevent abuse, Tallyfy limits how often you can do certain things in a short time. You might see an error if you reach these limits:

| Action                 | Limit (Approximate)             |
|------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Update Email/Password  | 3 times / day                   |
| Update Account Details | 7 times / day                   |
| Send/Resend Invites    | 10 times / day                  |
| API Calls              | ~140 / 10 secs (can vary)       |
| API GET Requests       | ~12 / 5 secs (can vary)         |

If you reach a rate limit, just wait a bit and try again. If you genuinely need higher limits (e.g., for an API integration), contact support.

### Images loading slowly?

If images seem slow to load, try these steps:

*   **(Chrome) Disable QUIC Protocol**: Type `chrome://flags` in the address bar, search for `QUIC`, set it to `Disabled`, and restart Chrome.
*   **Disable Browser Extensions**: Turn off extensions one by one to see if one is causing the slowdown.
*   **Check Firewall/Antivirus**: Try temporarily disabling security software to see if it's causing problems, then adjust its settings for Tallyfy if needed.
