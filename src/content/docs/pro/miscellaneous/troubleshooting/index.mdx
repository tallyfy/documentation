## Common troubleshooting steps

Before contacting support, try these general troubleshooting steps to resolve most common issues in Tallyfy:

1. **Clear your browser cache** - Select your browser below for instructions:
   - [Chrome](/products/pro/miscellaneous/troubleshooting/clear-cache-chrome/)
   - [Firefox](/products/pro/miscellaneous/troubleshooting/clear-cache-firefox/)
   - [Safari](/products/pro/miscellaneous/troubleshooting/clear-cache-safari/)
   - [Edge](/products/pro/miscellaneous/troubleshooting/clear-cache-edge/)

2. **Try a different browser** - Some issues may only occur in specific browsers.

3. **Check your internet connection** - A stable internet connection is required for Tallyfy to function properly.

4. **Disable browser extensions** - Some extensions can interfere with web applications.

5. **Update your browser** - Using an outdated browser can cause compatibility issues.

## Rate limits

Tallyfy enforces the following rate limits for security reasons:

| Action | Limit |
| ------ | ----- |
| Email update | 3 times per day |
| Password update | 3 times per day |
| Account update | 7 times per day |
| Send invite | 10 times per day |
| Resend invite | 10 times per day |
| API calls | 140 calls every 10 seconds (may be dynamically adjusted) |
| API GET requests | 12 requests every 5 seconds (may be dynamically adjusted) |

If you receive rate limit errors, wait and try again later or contact support for assistance with legitimate high-volume needs.

## Images loading slowly

Slow image loading may be caused by protocol issues or browser configurations. Try these fixes:

### Disable QUIC Protocol in Chrome

1. Open Chrome and enter `chrome://flags` in the address bar
2. Search for "Experimental QUIC protocol"
3. Set it to "Disabled"
4. Restart Chrome

### Disable browser extensions

Browser extensions can significantly impact performance:

1. Temporarily disable all extensions
2. Restart your browser
3. If performance improves, re-enable extensions one by one to identify the problematic one

### Check firewall and antivirus settings

Security software can block or slow connections:

1. Temporarily disable your firewall/antivirus
2. Test if the issue persists
3. If resolved, configure your security software to allow Tallyfy
