## How can I troubleshoot common Tallyfy issues?

When Tallyfy<sup>Â®</sup> experiences problems like pages not loading properly, errors appearing, or features not responding correctly, these systematic troubleshooting steps can resolve most issues before requiring support assistance:

1.  **Clear your browser's cache completely**: Outdated website data frequently causes display and functionality problems. Choose your browser for detailed clearing instructions:
    *   [Chrome Cache Clearing Guide](/products/pro/miscellaneous/troubleshooting/clear-cache-chrome/)
    *   [Firefox Cache Clearing Guide](/products/pro/miscellaneous/troubleshooting/clear-cache-firefox/)
    *   [Safari Cache Clearing Guide](/products/pro/miscellaneous/troubleshooting/clear-cache-safari/)
    *   [Edge Cache Clearing Guide](/products/pro/miscellaneous/troubleshooting/clear-cache-edge/)
2.  **Test with an alternative web browser**: This diagnostic step helps determine if the issue is browser-specific or affects all browsers.
3.  **Verify internet connection stability**: Confirm you have a reliable, consistent internet connection without intermittent disconnections.
4.  **Disable browser extensions temporarily**: Browser add-ons like ad blockers, privacy tools, or security extensions can interfere with Tallyfy functionality. Disable them individually to identify conflicts.
5.  **Update to the latest browser version**: Ensure you're running the most current version of your web browser for optimal compatibility.

### How can I force my browser to load the latest Tallyfy version?

Browsers sometimes cache outdated versions of the Tallyfy web application, causing functionality issues. A "hard refresh" forces your browser to bypass cached files and download the most current code directly from Tallyfy's servers.

#### What are the hard refresh keyboard shortcuts for each browser?

| Browser   | Windows/Linux             | macOS                     |
|-----------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| Chrome    | `Ctrl + F5` or `Ctrl + Shift + R` | `Cmd + Shift + R`         |
| Firefox   | `Ctrl + F5` or `Ctrl + Shift + R` | `Cmd + Shift + R`         |
| Edge      | `Ctrl + F5` or `Ctrl + Shift + R` | `Cmd + Shift + R`         |
| Safari    | (See note below)          | `Cmd + Option + R`        |

*   **Safari Note**: For Safari, you might need to hold `Shift` and click the normal Reload button, or hold `Option` and click Reload, or use the `Cmd + Option + R` shortcut. You can also use the Developer Tools method.
*   **Alternative (Most Browsers)**: Open Developer Tools (`F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` / `Cmd+Option+I`), then right-click the browser's reload button and choose "Empty Cache and Hard Reload".

If a hard refresh doesn't help, try clearing your full browser cache using the links in step 1 above.

### Why am I seeing rate limit errors in Tallyfy?

Tallyfy implements rate limiting to prevent system abuse and ensure platform stability. When you exceed these limits within specific timeframes, you may encounter temporary restriction errors:

| Action                 | Limit (Approximate)             |
|------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Update Email/Password  | 3 times / day                   |
| Update Account Details | 7 times / day                   |
| Send/Resend Invites    | 10 times / day                  |
| API Calls              | ~140 / 10 secs (can vary)       |
| API GET Requests       | ~12 / 5 secs (can vary)         |

When you encounter rate limit restrictions, wait the specified time period before attempting the action again. If your legitimate use case requires higher limits (such as API integrations), contact our support team to discuss increased allowances.

### Why are images loading slowly in Tallyfy?

When Tallyfy images load slowly or fail to appear, these targeted solutions can improve performance:

*   **Chrome QUIC Protocol Adjustment**: Navigate to `chrome://flags` in the address bar, search for `QUIC`, set it to `Disabled`, and restart Chrome to resolve connection issues.
*   **Browser Extension Isolation**: Systematically disable extensions one at a time to identify which add-on might be interfering with image loading performance.
*   **Security Software Configuration**: Temporarily disable firewall or antivirus software to test if these programs are blocking image requests, then configure appropriate exceptions for Tallyfy if needed.
