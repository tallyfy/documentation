### Common troubleshooting steps

Before contacting [support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/), try these general troubleshooting steps to resolve most common issues in Tallyfy:

1. **Clear your browser cache** - Select your browser below for instructions:
   - [Chrome](/products/pro/miscellaneous/troubleshooting/clear-cache-chrome/)
   - [Firefox](/products/pro/miscellaneous/troubleshooting/clear-cache-firefox/)
   - [Safari](/products/pro/miscellaneous/troubleshooting/clear-cache-safari/)
   - [Edge](/products/pro/miscellaneous/troubleshooting/clear-cache-edge/)

2. **Try a different browser** - Some issues may only occur in specific browsers.

3. **Check your internet connection** - A stable internet connection is required for Tallyfy to function properly.

4. **Disable browser extensions** - Some extensions can interfere with web applications.

5. **Update your browser** - Using an outdated browser can cause compatibility issues.

### Get the latest app version with a hard refresh

Sometimes your browser may cache an older version of the Tallyfy client app. To ensure you're using the latest version, perform a hard refresh:

#### Hard refresh methods for different browsers

| Browser | Windows/Linux | macOS |
|---------|---------------|-------|
| Chrome | Ctrl + F5 or Ctrl + Shift + R | Command + Shift + R |
| Firefox | Ctrl + F5 or Ctrl + Shift + R | Command + Shift + R |
| Edge | Ctrl + F5 or Ctrl + Shift + R | Command + Shift + R |
| Safari | N/A | Command + Option + R (or hold Shift and click the Reload button) |

When you perform a hard refresh, the browser bypasses its cache and downloads all resources again, ensuring you have the most recent version of the Tallyfy app.

#### Alternative methods

1. **Chrome and Edge**: Open Developer Tools (F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I / Command+Option+I), right-click the reload button, and select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
2. **Firefox**: Press Shift while clicking the reload button
3. **Safari**: Hold Option while clicking the reload button in the toolbar

If you continue to experience issues after a hard refresh, try clearing your browser cache completely using the browser-specific instructions below.

### Rate limits

Tallyfy enforces the following rate limits for security reasons:

| Action | Limit |
| ------ | ----- |
| Email update | 3 times per day |
| Password update | 3 times per day |
| Account update | 7 times per day |
| [Send invite](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-to-invite-and-activate-members-on-tallyfy/) | 10 times per day |
| [Resend invite](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-to-resend-or-withdraw-invites-in-tallyfy/) | 10 times per day |
| [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) calls | 140 calls every 10 seconds (may be dynamically adjusted) |
| API GET requests | 12 requests every 5 seconds (may be dynamically adjusted) |

If you receive rate limit errors, wait and try again later or [contact support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/) for assistance with legitimate high-volume needs.

### Images loading slowly

Slow image loading may be caused by protocol issues or browser configurations. Try these fixes:

#### Disable QUIC Protocol in Chrome

1. Open Chrome and enter `chrome://flags` in the address bar
2. Search for "Experimental QUIC protocol"
3. Set it to "Disabled"
4. Restart Chrome

#### Disable browser extensions

Browser extensions can significantly impact performance:

1. Temporarily disable all extensions
2. Restart your browser
3. If performance improves, re-enable extensions one by one to identify the problematic one

#### Check firewall and antivirus settings

Security software can block or slow connections:

1. Temporarily disable your firewall/antivirus
2. Test if the issue persists
3. If resolved, configure your security software to allow Tallyfy
