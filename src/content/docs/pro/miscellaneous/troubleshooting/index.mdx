## Troubleshooting common Tallyfy issues

When Tallyfy experiences problems like pages not loading properly, errors appearing, or features not responding correctly, these systematic troubleshooting steps can resolve most issues before requiring support assistance:

1.  **Clear your browser's cache completely**: Outdated website data frequently causes display and functionality problems. Choose your browser for detailed clearing instructions:
    *   [Chrome Cache Clearing Guide](/products/pro/miscellaneous/troubleshooting/clear-cache-chrome/)
    *   [Firefox Cache Clearing Guide](/products/pro/miscellaneous/troubleshooting/clear-cache-firefox/)
    *   [Safari Cache Clearing Guide](/products/pro/miscellaneous/troubleshooting/clear-cache-safari/)
    *   [Edge Cache Clearing Guide](/products/pro/miscellaneous/troubleshooting/clear-cache-edge/)
2.  **Test with an alternative web browser**: This diagnostic step helps determine if the issue is browser-specific or affects all browsers.
3.  **Verify internet connection stability**: Confirm you have a reliable, consistent internet connection without intermittent disconnections.
4.  **Disable browser extensions temporarily**: Browser add-ons like ad blockers, privacy tools, or security extensions can interfere with Tallyfy functionality. Disable them individually to identify conflicts.
5.  **Update to the latest browser version**: Ensure you're running the most current version of your web browser for optimal compatibility.

### Forcing your browser to load the latest version

Browsers sometimes cache outdated versions of the Tallyfy web application, causing functionality issues. A "hard refresh" forces your browser to bypass cached files and download the most current code directly from Tallyfy's servers.

To perform a hard refresh, use your browser's built-in refresh options. Most browsers allow you to right-click the reload button and choose "Empty Cache and Hard Reload" or similar options from the menu that appears.

If a hard refresh doesn't help, try clearing your full browser cache using the links in step 1 above.

### Fixing authentication loops when logging in

If you're experiencing authentication loops where the system keeps asking for credentials repeatedly, can't properly sign in, or get stuck in a redirect cycle, the solution is to force a complete logout to clear all session data.

#### Solution for authentication loop issues

<Steps>
1. **Force complete logout** by visiting: [https://account.tallyfy.com/logout](https://account.tallyfy.com/logout)
   - This URL completely clears all authentication sessions
   - Works even when the regular logout button isn't accessible
2. **Clear browser data for Tallyfy**
   - Clear cookies specifically for `*.tallyfy.com` domains
   - Clear cached data for the last hour
3. **Close all Tallyfy browser tabs**
   - Ensure no Tallyfy pages remain open
   - This prevents session conflicts
4. **Wait 10-15 seconds**
   - Give the system time to fully clear your session
   - This ensures complete logout across all services
5. **Try logging in again** at: [https://go.tallyfy.com](https://go.tallyfy.com)
   - Use your regular credentials
   - You should now be able to log in normally
</Steps>

:::tip[When to use this solution]
Use the logout URL immediately when you experience:
- Being asked for credentials repeatedly in a loop
- Unable to progress past the login screen
- Redirected in circles between login pages
- Can't switch between organizations
- Stuck on the wrong organization after login
- SSO authentication loops
- Password reset redirecting to account creation
- Any situation where you're "stuck" in the authentication process
:::

:::note[Why this happens]
Authentication loops typically occur when:
- Browser sessions become corrupted or conflicted
- Multiple authentication attempts create overlapping sessions
- Organization switching leaves residual session data
- SSO and regular login methods conflict
- Browser extensions interfere with authentication cookies
:::

#### Nuclear option: Complete browser data wipe script

If the standard logout URL and cache clearing don't resolve persistent login or signout issues, you can use this script to wipe all Tallyfy-related data from your browser. This removes every trace of cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage, IndexedDB, cache storage, and service workers.

:::caution[Important limitations]
This script cannot wipe data across all Tallyfy origins (e.g., `go.tallyfy.com`, `account.tallyfy.com`) in a single execution because browsers enforce origin-based security. You'll need to run it on each Tallyfy domain you use. Additionally, HttpOnly cookies (server-only) cannot be removed by JavaScript - you'll need to use Chrome's site data settings for those.
:::

**How to use this script:**

<Steps>
1. **Open DevTools Console** on any Tallyfy page (press F12, then click Console tab)
2. **Paste the script below** and press Enter
3. **Repeat on each Tallyfy origin** you use:
   - Run once at `https://go.tallyfy.com`
   - Run again at `https://account.tallyfy.com`
   - Run on any other Tallyfy subdomain you access
4. **(Optional) Clear HttpOnly cookies** using Chrome's site data manager:
   - Chrome Settings → Privacy and Security → See all site data and permissions
   - Search "tallyfy" and remove site data
</Steps>

**The script:**

```js
(async () => {
  const log = (...a) => console.log("[tallyfy-all-origins]", ...a);

  // ---- Cookie helpers
  const cookieNames = document.cookie
    .split(";")
    .map(c => c.trim())
    .filter(Boolean)
    .map(c => c.split("=")[0]);

  // Build domain candidates: current host chain plus .tallyfy.com (site-wide)
  const host = location.hostname; // e.g., go.tallyfy.com
  const parts = host.split(".");
  const domains = new Set([host, "." + host, ".tallyfy.com"]);
  for (let i = 1; i < parts.length - 1; i++) {
    const d = parts.slice(i).join(".");
    domains.add(d);
    domains.add("." + d);
  }

  // Build path candidates from deep to root
  const segs = location.pathname.split("/").filter(Boolean);
  const paths = new Set(["/"]);
  let acc = "";
  for (const s of segs) { acc += "/" + s; paths.add(acc); }
  const pathList = Array.from(paths).reverse();

  const expire = (name, domain, path) => {
    const pieces = [
      `${encodeURIComponent(name)}=`,
      "Expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT",
      "Max-Age=0",
      `Path=${path}`
    ];
    if (domain) pieces.push(`Domain=${domain}`);
    document.cookie = pieces.join("; ");
  };

  try {
    log(`Attempting cookie deletions for ${cookieNames.length} visible (non-HttpOnly) cookie(s).`);
    for (const name of cookieNames) {
      // host-only attempt
      for (const p of pathList) expire(name, null, p);
      // domain/path permutations (incl. .tallyfy.com if applicable)
      for (const d of domains) for (const p of pathList) expire(name, d, p);
    }
    log("Cookie deletion attempts complete (covers host-only & domain-scoped variants where JS-visible).");
  } catch (e) {
    console.warn("[tallyfy-all-origins] cookie error:", e);
  }

  // ---- Web Storage
  try { localStorage.clear(); sessionStorage.clear(); log("Cleared localStorage & sessionStorage."); }
  catch (e) { console.warn("[tallyfy-all-origins] storage error:", e); }

  // ---- IndexedDB
  try {
    if (indexedDB && indexedDB.databases) {
      const dbs = await indexedDB.databases();
      if (Array.isArray(dbs)) {
        for (const db of dbs) {
          if (!db?.name) continue;
          await new Promise(res => {
            const req = indexedDB.deleteDatabase(db.name);
            req.onsuccess = req.onerror = req.onblocked = () => res();
          });
        }
      }
      log("Deleted IndexedDB databases for this origin.");
    } else {
      log("indexedDB.databases() unsupported here; cannot enumerate DBs.");
    }
  } catch (e) {
    console.warn("[tallyfy-all-origins] indexedDB error:", e);
  }

  // ---- Cache Storage (PWA caches)
  try {
    if (self.caches?.keys) {
      const keys = await caches.keys();
      await Promise.all(keys.map(k => caches.delete(k)));
      log("Cleared Cache Storage for this origin.");
    }
  } catch (e) {
    console.warn("[tallyfy-all-origins] cache error:", e);
  }

  // ---- Service workers
  try {
    const regs = (await navigator.serviceWorker?.getRegistrations?.()) || [];
    await Promise.all(regs.map(r => r.unregister()));
    log(`Unregistered ${regs.length} service worker(s) for this origin.`);
  } catch (e) {
    console.warn("[tallyfy-all-origins] service worker error:", e);
  }

  log("Done on this origin. Repeat on any other Tallyfy origins you use (e.g., go.tallyfy.com, account.tallyfy.com).");
})();
```

**What this script clears:**

- **JavaScript-accessible cookies** for the current origin and `.tallyfy.com` domain
- **localStorage and sessionStorage** data
- **IndexedDB databases** (if your browser supports enumeration)
- **Cache Storage** (Progressive Web App caches)
- **Service workers** registered for the current origin

**Why you must run per origin:**

Browser security (same-origin policy) prevents JavaScript running on one domain from accessing another domain's storage. Each Tallyfy subdomain maintains separate storage that can only be cleared when you're actually visiting that subdomain.

**HttpOnly cookies limitation:**

HttpOnly cookies are invisible to JavaScript for security reasons. To remove these, use Chrome's built-in site data manager after running the script:

1. Chrome Settings → Privacy and Security → See all site data and permissions
2. Search "tallyfy"
3. Click "Remove" for tallyfy.com

This removes all site data including HttpOnly cookies across all Tallyfy subdomains.

:::tip[When to use the nuclear option]
Use this thorough script when:
- The standard logout URL doesn't resolve authentication loops
- Clearing cache through browser settings hasn't worked
- You're experiencing persistent session conflicts across multiple Tallyfy origins
- You need to completely reset your Tallyfy browser state for troubleshooting
- You're switching between multiple organizations with conflicting sessions
:::

### Why am I seeing rate limit errors in Tallyfy?

Tallyfy implements rate limiting to prevent system abuse and ensure platform stability. When you exceed these limits within specific timeframes, you may encounter temporary restriction errors:

| Action                 | Limit (Approximate)             |
|------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Update Email/Password  | 3 times / day                   |
| Update Account Details | 7 times / day                   |
| Send/Resend Invites    | 10 times / day                  |
| API Calls              | ~140 / 10 secs (can vary)       |
| API GET Requests       | ~12 / 5 secs (can vary)         |

When you encounter rate limit restrictions, wait the specified time period before attempting the action again. If your legitimate use case requires higher limits (such as API integrations), contact our support team to discuss increased allowances.

### Password reset prompts to create a new account

Sometimes members (especially Light members) experience an issue where attempting to reset their password directs them to create a new account instead. This typically happens when the system doesn't properly recognize their existing account status.

#### Solution for password reset redirection issues

Follow these specific steps to properly reset your password when experiencing this issue:

<Steps>
1. First, completely log out by visiting: [https://account.tallyfy.com/logout](https://account.tallyfy.com/logout)
2. After logging out, go directly to the password reset page: [https://account.tallyfy.com/password/reset](https://account.tallyfy.com/password/reset)
3. Enter your email address associated with your Tallyfy account
4. Click **Submit** to send the reset link
5. Check your email for the password reset link
6. Click the link in the email to set your new password
7. After setting the new password, you'll be automatically logged in and should see your organization
</Steps>

:::note[Why this happens]
This issue can occur when browser sessions aren't properly cleared or when there's confusion between member account states. The logout step ensures a clean session before initiating the password reset process.
:::

### Redirected to create an organization after login

Sometimes after successfully logging in or resetting your password, you're incorrectly redirected to the organization creation page (`go.tallyfy.com/organizations/create`) instead of your existing organization. This happens when the browser session gets confused about your organization membership.

#### Solution for organization creation redirect

Follow these steps in exact order to resolve this issue:

<Steps>
1. **Force logout** by visiting: [https://account.tallyfy.com/logout](https://account.tallyfy.com/logout)
2. **Clear browser session** - Close all Tallyfy tabs and clear cookies for tallyfy.com
3. **Reset password** at: [https://account.tallyfy.com/password/reset](https://account.tallyfy.com/password/reset)
4. **Enter your email** and submit to receive the reset link
5. **Set new password** using the link from your email
6. **Manual login required** - After setting the password, you'll be redirected to login screen
7. **Log in manually** with your new password to access your correct organization
</Steps>

:::tip[Prevention tip]
This issue often affects users who switch between multiple Tallyfy organizations or use shared computers. Always log out completely when switching accounts to prevent session confusion.
:::

### Mobile login issues

If you created an account on desktop but can't log in on mobile (or vice versa), follow these steps:

**Common causes**:
- Browser cookies/cache preventing proper authentication
- Using different browsers with conflicting sessions
- Auto-fill entering incorrect credentials

**Solution**:
1. **Clear mobile browser data** - Go to your mobile browser settings and clear cache/cookies for tallyfy.com
2. **Use the same browser** - Try using the same browser brand on both devices (e.g., Chrome on both)
3. **Check credentials carefully** - Mobile keyboards often auto-capitalize or add spaces
4. **Try incognito/private mode** - This bypasses any stored session issues
5. **Reset password if needed** - Use the password reset flow to ensure you have the correct credentials

:::tip[Mobile access works the same]
Tallyfy is fully responsive - the same login credentials work on all devices. There's no separate mobile app or different login system. If you can log in on desktop, those exact credentials work on mobile.

### Microsoft login shows "Need admin approval"

When signing in with Microsoft, you might see a "Need admin approval" message followed by "Tallyfy API - unverified". This occurs when your organization's Azure Active Directory settings require administrator consent before employees can use third-party applications.

**What's happening**: Your company's IT policies restrict which apps can access Microsoft accounts. Tallyfy needs explicit approval from an administrator before any user can sign in with their work Microsoft account.

**Immediate workaround for users**:
- Click **Return to the application without granting consent**
- On the Tallyfy sign-up page, use **email and password** instead of Microsoft sign-in
- You can still access all Tallyfy features with a standard email/password account

**Permanent solution (requires IT administrator)**:

Your IT administrator needs to approve Tallyfy in Azure Active Directory:

<Steps>
1. IT admin signs into [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Navigate to **Azure Active Directory** → **Enterprise applications**
3. Click **Consent and permissions** → **User consent settings**
4. Look for pending consent requests or search for "Tallyfy API"
5. Review the permissions (basic profile, email, maintain access)
6. Click **Grant admin consent** for the organization
7. Confirm the approval - this enables access for all users
</Steps>

Once approved, all employees can use Microsoft sign-in immediately. The consent only needs to happen once per organization. If you see error code `AADSTS900144` after returning without consent, this confirms the admin approval requirement.

**Additional resources**:
- [Microsoft's guide on "Need admin approval" popups](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1497998/need-admin-approval-popup)
- [Azure AD consent and permissions documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/configure-admin-consent-workflow)

### Images loading slowly

When Tallyfy images load slowly or fail to appear, these targeted solutions can improve performance:

*   **Chrome QUIC Protocol Adjustment**: Navigate to `chrome://flags` in the address bar, search for `QUIC`, set it to `Disabled`, and restart Chrome to resolve connection issues.
*   **Browser Extension Isolation**: Systematically disable extensions one at a time to identify which add-on might be interfering with image loading performance.
*   **Security Software Configuration**: Temporarily disable firewall or antivirus software to test if these programs are blocking image requests, then configure appropriate exceptions for Tallyfy if needed.
