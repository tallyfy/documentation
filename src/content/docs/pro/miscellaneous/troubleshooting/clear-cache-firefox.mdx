## Clearing Firefox's cache to fix Tallyfy issues

If Tallyfy isn't loading properly or shows outdated content in Firefox, clearing your cache forces the browser to download fresh files from Tallyfy's servers.

<Steps>
1. Click the menu button (☰) in the top-right corner of Firefox.
2. Select **Settings**.
3. Click **Privacy & Security** in the left sidebar.
4. Scroll to the **Cookies and Site Data** section and click **Clear Data...**.
5. Set the **When** dropdown to **Everything**.
6. Check both **Cookies and Site Data** and **Temporary cached files and pages**.
7. Click **Clear**.
</Steps>

### After clearing the cache

Close Firefox completely and reopen it before going back to Tallyfy. This makes sure all old cached data is fully removed.

### If clearing cache doesn't fix the issue

If clearing Firefox's cache doesn't solve your Tallyfy problems, [contact Tallyfy support](https://tallyfy.com/contact-us/) for further help.
