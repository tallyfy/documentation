## How to install the Tallyfy desktop app

The Tallyfy desktop app provides a native experience on macOS, Windows, and Linux. It wraps the same Tallyfy web application you already use - so all features work exactly the same - but adds desktop-specific benefits like native notifications and system tray integration.

### Why use the desktop app?

The desktop app offers several advantages over using Tallyfy in a browser:

- **Native notifications** - Get task reminders even when your browser is closed
- **System tray** - Quick access to Tallyfy from your menubar or taskbar
- **Seamless login** - The app can import your existing Google or Microsoft login from Chrome, so you may already be logged in
- **Auto-updates** - The app automatically updates when new versions are available
- **Dedicated window** - Keep Tallyfy separate from your browser tabs

### Download and install

Visit the [Tallyfy Desktop releases page](https://github.com/tallyfy/desktop/releases) to download the latest version for your platform.

#### macOS

1. Download the `.dmg` file for your Mac (Intel or Apple Silicon)
2. Open the DMG file and drag the Tallyfy icon to your Applications folder
3. On first launch, you may need to right-click the app and select **Open** to bypass Gatekeeper (since the app is not yet notarized)
4. If you see a "damaged" error, open Terminal and run: `xattr -cr /Applications/Tallyfy.app`

#### Windows

1. Download the `.exe` installer
2. Run the installer and follow the prompts
3. On first launch, Windows SmartScreen may show a warning - click **More info** then **Run anyway**
4. The app will appear in your Start menu

#### Linux

1. Download the `.AppImage` file (or `.deb` for Debian/Ubuntu)
2. For AppImage: Make it executable with `chmod +x Tallyfy-*.AppImage` and run it
3. For DEB: Install with `sudo dpkg -i Tallyfy-*.deb`

### System requirements

| Platform | Minimum Version |
|----------|-----------------|
| macOS | 12.0 (Monterey) or later |
| Windows | Windows 10 or later |
| Linux | Ubuntu 22.04 or equivalent |

### Signing in

When you launch the Tallyfy desktop app for the first time, it automatically tries to import your existing login from Chrome. If you're already signed into Google or Microsoft in Chrome, you may be logged into Tallyfy automatically.

If automatic login doesn't work:
1. Click any sign-in option (Google, Microsoft, email)
2. Complete the authentication flow - it opens in your system browser
3. Return to the desktop app after signing in

### Troubleshooting

**macOS shows "app is damaged" error**

This happens because the app isn't notarized yet. Fix it by running:
```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/Tallyfy.app
```

**Windows SmartScreen warning**

Click **More info** then **Run anyway**. This warning appears because the app doesn't have an extended validation certificate yet.

**Not logged in automatically**

The Chrome cookie import requires access to Chrome's Safe Storage. On macOS, you may be prompted to allow Keychain access - click **Allow** to enable automatic login.

**App won't start**

Ensure you have the correct version for your system architecture (Intel vs Apple Silicon on Mac, 64-bit vs 32-bit on Windows).
