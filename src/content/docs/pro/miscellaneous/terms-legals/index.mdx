## Compliance and legal overview

Tallyfy<sup>Â®</sup> has strong [compliance](/products/pro/compliance/), legal, [security](/products/pro/compliance/), and privacy standards:

* **SOC 2 Type 2** attested.
* **HSTS compliant**: Important for preventing man-in-the-middle attacks. Our domain (`tallyfy.com`) is pre-loaded as secure in major browsers.
* **BIMI compliant**: An email standard for brand recognition, helping prevent phishing.
* **Can sign custom DPAs** for EU, UK, or specific US states (like CCPA).
* **GDPR compliant**: Via Data Privacy Framework (DPF) attestation.
* **Can sign contracts** for custom enterprise needs.
* **Free SSO**: We offer Single Sign On (SSO) free to all customers. Security shouldn't cost extra.
* **Data encryption**: Data is encrypted in transit and at rest.
* **Data separation**: Data is logically separated on our multi-tenant cloud hosting (`us-west-2` on Amazon Web Services).
* **AWS GovCloud hosting**: Available for certain customers needing higher security. Requires an enterprise contract - please [schedule a consultation](https://tallyfy.com/booking/).
* **API Security**: Every [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) request goes through a Cloudflare Worker and a WAF (Web Application Firewall).
* **Country blocking**: We block countries under US trade sanctions.
* **Tor blocking**: Requests from Tor browsers are dropped.
* **Rate limiting**: Runs at the edge to handle traffic spikes.
* **Custom insurance**: Can offer custom insurance coverage for enterprises.

Our [compliance automation software](https://tallyfy.com/solutions/compliance-automation-software/) helps organizations meet regulations through standardized processes, automated tracking, and detailed audit trails.
