## Compliance and legal standards

Tallyfy maintains [compliance](/products/pro/compliance/), legal, [security](/products/pro/compliance/), and privacy standards built for enterprise and regulatory needs:

* **SOC 2 Type 2 Attestation** - Independently verified security controls and operational effectiveness for data protection.
* **HSTS Compliance** - HTTP Strict Transport Security prevents man-in-the-middle attacks. The `tallyfy.com` domain is pre-loaded as secure in major browsers.
* **BIMI Compliance** - Brand Indicators for Message Identification enhances brand recognition and prevents phishing attacks.
* **Custom Data Processing Agreements** - Available for EU, UK, or specific US states (like CCPA) to meet regional privacy requirements.
* **GDPR Compliance** - Achieved through Data Privacy Framework (DPF) attestation for full European data protection.
* **Enterprise Contract Flexibility** - Custom contracts available for specialized enterprise needs.
* **Free Single Sign-On** - SSO is included free for all customers - security shouldn't cost extra.
* **Full Data Encryption** - All data is encrypted both in transit and at rest using industry-standard protocols.
* **Logical Data Separation** - Multi-tenant cloud hosting with logical data separation, hosted in `us-west-2` on Amazon Web Services.
* **AWS GovCloud Hosting** - Available for customers needing enhanced security standards. Requires an enterprise contract - [schedule a consultation](https://tallyfy.com/booking/) for details.
* **Multi-layer API Security** - Every [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) request goes through Cloudflare Workers and Web Application Firewall (WAF) protection.
* **Sanctions Compliance** - Access is blocked from countries under US trade sanctions.
* **Anonymous Network Blocking** - Requests from Tor browsers are automatically blocked.
* **Edge Rate Limiting** - Rate limiting at the network edge handles traffic spikes and prevents abuse.
* **Enterprise Insurance Options** - Custom insurance coverage available for enterprises with specific liability requirements.
