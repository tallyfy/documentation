## Compliance and legal overview

Tallyfy is strongly positioned when it comes to [compliance](/products/pro/compliance/), legal, [security](/products/pro/compliance/) and privacy:

* **SOC 2 Type 2** attested
* **HSTS compliant** - this is very important even though other vendors don't talk about it because it prevents common man-in-the-middle attacks. Our domain - tallyfy.com is pre-loaded as secure in common browsers.
* **BIMI compliant** - which is an email standard that ensures strong compliance to brand and recognition, preventing phishing and much more.
* **Able to sign a custom DPA** for EU, DPA or specific US states
* **GDPR compliant** via our Privacy Shield and DPF attestation
* **Able to sign contracts** for customized enterprise requirements
* **We offer free SSO** (Single Sign On) to all customers. Security should not cost extra.
* **Data is encrypted in transit and at rest**
* **Data is logically separated** in our multi-tenant cloud hosting on us-west-2 on Amazon Web Services
* **AWS GovCloud hosting** is available for certain customers requiring higher security compliance. This requires an enterprise agreement - please schedule a consultation at [https://tallyfy.com/booking/](https://tallyfy.com/booking/)
* **Every [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) request** goes through a custom Cloudflare Worker and a WAF (Web Application Firewall)
* **We block countries** under US trade sanctions
* **Requests from Tor browsers** are dropped and never accepted
* **Rate limiting** runs on the edge at any scale
* **We can offer custom insurance coverage** for enterprises
