* **SOC 2 Type 2 Attestation**: Independently verified security controls and operational effectiveness for data protection.
* **HSTS Compliance**: HTTP Strict Transport Security prevents man-in-the-middle attacks. The `tallyfy.com` domain is pre-loaded as secure in major browsers.
* **BIMI Compliance**: Brand Indicators for Message Identification email standard enhances brand recognition and prevents phishing attacks.
* **Custom Data Processing Agreements**: Available for EU, UK, or specific US states (like CCPA) to meet regional privacy requirements.
* **GDPR Compliance**: Achieved through Data Privacy Framework (DPF) attestation for full European data protection.
* **Enterprise Contract Flexibility**: Custom contracts available for specialized enterprise requirements and compliance needs.
* **Complimentary Single Sign-On**: SSO functionality provided free to all customers because security shouldn't require additional costs.
* **Complete Data Encryption**: All data is encrypted both in transit and at rest using industry-standard encryption protocols.
* **Logical Data Separation**: Multi-tenant cloud hosting with logical data separation hosted in `us-west-2` on Amazon Web Services.
* **AWS GovCloud Hosting**: Available for customers requiring enhanced security standards. Requires enterprise contract - [schedule a consultation](https://tallyfy.com/booking/) for details.
* **Multi-Layer API Security**: Every [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) request processes through Cloudflare Workers and Web Application Firewall (WAF) protection.
* **Sanctions Compliance**: Access blocked from countries under US trade sanctions to ensure regulatory compliance.
* **Anonymous Network Blocking**: Requests from Tor browsers are automatically blocked for enhanced security.
* **Edge Rate Limiting**: Advanced rate limiting at network edge handles traffic spikes and prevents abuse.
