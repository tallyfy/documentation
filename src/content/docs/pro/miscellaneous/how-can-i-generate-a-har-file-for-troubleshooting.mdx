title: Generate a HAR File for Troubleshooting

## How to generate a HAR file

A HAR file is a useful tool for troubleshooting issues related to speed, caching, and hard-to-replicate problems on the web. It contains information about the requests made by a browser, including headers, response, and load time.

To generate a HAR file, follow these steps:

### Using Chrome:

1. Go to the URL where you're experiencing the issue.
2. Right-click anywhere on the page, and select "Inspect Element."
3. In the developer tools at the bottom of the browser, click on the "Network" tab.
4. Click on the record button and either refresh the page or click on a problematic link to reproduce the issue.
5. Right-click within the Network tab and choose "Save as HAR with Content" to save the file.
6. Attach the HAR file to your support ticket or email response.

### Using Firefox:

1. Go to the URL where you're experiencing the issue.
2. Navigate to Tools > Web Developer > Network, or press Ctrl+Shift+I (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Option+I (OS X).
3. Refresh the page or click on a problematic link to capture the traffic.
4. Click on "Export" and then "Save As..." to save the HAR file.

### Using Internet Explorer (after version 11):

Unfortunately, Internet Explorer doesn't have native support for HAR files. However, you can find similar functionality described on Microsoft Developer Network. Follow the instructions and send us the resulting XML or CSV file.

### Using Microsoft Edge:

1. Go to the URL where you're experiencing the issue.
2. Press F12 to open Developer tools and select the "Network" tab.
3. Refresh the page or click on a problematic link to capture the traffic.
4. Click on "Export as HAR" and then "Save As" to save the HAR file.

### Using Safari:

1. In Safari, check if you have the "Develop" menu at the top of the screen. If not, go to Safari > Preferences > Advanced and enable "Show Develop Menu in the menu bar."
2. Go to the URL where you're experiencing the issue.
3. Navigate to Develop > Show Web Inspector (this option may not be available until you browse beyond Safari's starting page).
4. Refresh the page or click on the problematic link to capture the traffic.
5. Right-click on the resource you want to capture and select "Export HAR."

Remember to attach the HAR file to your support ticket or email response. Let us help you troubleshoot and resolve the issue with your web experience!
