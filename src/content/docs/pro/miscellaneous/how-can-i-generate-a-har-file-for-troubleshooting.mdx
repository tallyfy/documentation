## How to generate a HAR file for troubleshooting

A HAR (HTTP Archive) file is a technical log used for diagnosing speed issues, caching problems, and hard-to-repeat problems on websites. It contains detailed info about your browser's activity, including requests, responses, and load times.

### Browser-specific instructions

#### Chrome

<Steps>
1. Go to the web page where the issue occurs.
2. Right-click anywhere on the page and choose **Inspect** or **Inspect Element**.
3. In the panel that opens, click the **Network** tab.
4. Make sure the circle/record button at the top left of the Network tab is red (recording). If it's grey, click it once to start recording.
5. Refresh the page or repeat the steps that cause the issue.
6. Right-click anywhere within the list of network requests in the Network tab.
7. Choose **Save all as HAR with Content**.
8. Save the HAR file to your computer.
9. Attach the generated HAR file to your support ticket or email.
</Steps>

#### Firefox

<Steps>
1. Go to the web page where the issue occurs.
2. Open the Network panel: Press **Ctrl+Shift+E** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd+Option+E** (macOS), or go to **Tools > Browser Tools > Web Developer Tools** and click the **Network** tab.
3. Refresh the page or repeat the steps that cause the issue to record the network activity.
4. Right-click anywhere within the list of network requests.
5. Choose **Save All As HAR**.
6. Save the HAR file to your computer.
7. Attach the generated HAR file to your support ticket or email.
</Steps>

#### Microsoft Edge

<Steps>
1. Go to the web page where the issue occurs.
2. Press **F12** to open the Developer Tools and select the **Network** tab.
3. Refresh the page or repeat the steps that cause the issue to record the network activity.
4. Click the **Export as HAR** button (looks like a floppy disk icon) in the Network tab's toolbar.
5. Choose **Save As**.
6. Save the HAR file to your computer.
7. Attach the generated HAR file to your support ticket or email.
</Steps>

#### Safari

<Steps>
1. Enable the Develop menu: Go to **Safari > Settings (or Preferences) > Advanced** and check the box for **Show Develop menu in menu bar** (or **Show features for web developers**).
2. Go to the web page where the issue occurs.
3. Select **Develop > Show Web Inspector**.
4. Click the **Network** tab.
5. Refresh the page or repeat the steps that cause the issue to record the network activity.
6. Click the **Export** button (usually near the top right of the Web Inspector) in the Network tab.
7. Save the HAR file to your computer.
8. Attach the generated HAR file to your support ticket or email.
</Steps>

#### Internet Explorer

Internet Explorer does not support HAR files directly. Use a different browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge if possible. If you must use IE, follow Microsoft's developer instructions for capturing network traffic (often results in an XML or CSV file) and provide that file instead.

Remember to attach the HAR file to your support ticket or email for effective troubleshooting help.
