## How do I create and share HAR files for support?

A HAR (HTTP Archive) file serves as a comprehensive technical log used for Tallyfy troubleshooting, diagnosing website speed issues, caching problems, and intermittent problems that are difficult to reproduce. This detailed file captures complete information about your browser's network activity, including all requests, responses, and precise load times.

#### Can I generate HAR files in Internet Explorer?

Internet Explorer does not support HAR file generation directly. We recommend using modern browsers like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge for HAR file creation. If you must use Internet Explorer, follow Microsoft's developer instructions for capturing network traffic (typically resulting in XML or CSV files) and provide those files instead.

### How should I share my HAR file with support?

Always attach the generated HAR file directly to your support ticket or email for effective troubleshooting assistance. HAR files contain detailed network information that helps support teams identify and resolve issues quickly.
