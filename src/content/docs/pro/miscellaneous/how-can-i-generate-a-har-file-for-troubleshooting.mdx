## What's a HAR file and why does support need one?

A HAR (HTTP Archive) file[^1] records everything your browser does on the network - every request, response, and load time. When you're hitting a speed issue, caching problem, or a bug that's hard to reproduce, a HAR file gives our support team the exact data they need to diagnose what's going wrong.

### How to generate a HAR file

#### Chrome

<Steps>
1. Go to the page where the issue happens.
2. Press **F12** (or right-click the page and select **Inspect**) to open Developer Tools.
3. Click the **Network** tab.
4. Make sure the record button (top-left circle) is red. If it's grey, click it to start recording.
5. Check **Preserve log** so the data isn't cleared on page reload.
6. Refresh the page or reproduce the issue.
7. Right-click anywhere in the network requests list and select **Save all as HAR with content**.
8. Save the file and attach it to your support ticket or email.
</Steps>

#### Firefox

<Steps>
1. Go to the page where the issue happens.
2. Press **Ctrl+Shift+E** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd+Option+E** (Mac) to open the Network panel directly. You can also use the menu: **Menu > More Tools > Web Developer Tools**, then click the **Network** tab.
3. Check **Persist Logs** if the issue spans multiple page loads.
4. Refresh the page or reproduce the issue.
5. Right-click anywhere in the network requests list and select **Save All As HAR**.
6. Save the file and attach it to your support ticket or email.
</Steps>

#### Microsoft Edge

<Steps>
1. Go to the page where the issue happens.
2. Press **F12** (or right-click and select **Inspect**) to open Developer Tools, then click the **Network** tab.
3. Check **Preserve log** so the data isn't cleared on page reload.
4. Refresh the page or reproduce the issue.
5. Right-click anywhere in the network requests list and select **Save all as HAR with content**.
6. Save the file and attach it to your support ticket or email.
</Steps>

#### Safari

<Steps>
1. Enable developer tools: go to **Safari > Settings > Advanced** and check **Show features for web developers**.
2. Go to the page where the issue happens.
3. Select **Develop > Show Web Inspector**.
4. Click the **Network** tab.
5. Refresh the page or reproduce the issue.
6. Click the **Export** button in the Network tab toolbar.
7. Save the file and attach it to your support ticket or email.
</Steps>

> Internet Explorer doesn't support HAR file export. If you're still on IE, please switch to Chrome, Firefox, or Edge to generate the HAR file.

### Sending the HAR file to support

Attach the HAR file directly to your support ticket or email. It contains the network-level detail our team needs to pinpoint and fix your issue.
