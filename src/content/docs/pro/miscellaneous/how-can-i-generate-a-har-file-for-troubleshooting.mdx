## How to generate a HAR file for troubleshooting

### Browser-specific instructions

2. Right-click anywhere on the page and select **Inspect Element**
3. In the developer tools panel, click the **Network** tab
4. Click the record button and either refresh the page or reproduce the issue
5. Right-click within the Network tab and select **Save as HAR with Content**
6. Attach the HAR file to your support ticket or email
</Steps>

#### Firefox

<Steps>
1. Navigate to the URL where you're experiencing the issue
2. Open the Network panel by selecting **Tools > Web Developer > Network** or pressing Ctrl+Shift+I (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Option+I (macOS)

4. Click **Export** and then **Save As...**
</Steps>

#### Microsoft Edge

2. Navigate to the URL where you're experiencing the issue
3. Select **Develop > Show Web Inspector**
4. Refresh the page or reproduce the issue to capture the network traffic
5. Right-click on the resource and select **Export HAR**

Internet Explorer doesn't natively support HAR files. For similar functionality, follow instructions on Microsoft Developer Network and provide the resulting XML or CSV file.

Remember to attach the HAR file to your support ticket or email for effective troubleshooting assistance.
