## Using private browsing for app connections

When connecting Tallyfy to external online tools (such as middleware, Slack, Google Drive, and other services), you may encounter login or authorization problems. These issues frequently stem from conflicting login information, cached data, or stored cookies in your regular browser session.

Your browser's **private browsing mode** (also called Incognito, InPrivate, or Private Window) resolves these connection issues by providing a clean browsing session without stored cookies, cached data, or saved login credentials.

### When to use private browsing

Use a private browsing window when you experience:
- Login errors during connection authorization attempts
- Repeated connection failures or timeout issues
- Specific troubleshooting requests from Tallyfy support
- Multiple account conflicts (e.g., different Google accounts) requiring clear account identification during connection setup

### Opening private browsing

#### Chrome
<Steps>
1. Click the three-dot menu (⋮) in the top right corner.
2. Select **New Incognito Window**.
3. In the new Incognito window, log into both Tallyfy and the external app, then attempt the integration setup again.
</Steps>

#### Firefox
<Steps>
1. Click the menu button (☰) in the top right corner.
2. Select **New Private Window**.
3. In the new Private window, log into both Tallyfy and the external app, then attempt the integration setup.
</Steps>

#### Microsoft Edge
<Steps>
1. Click the three-dot menu (⋯) in the top right corner.
2. Select **New InPrivate window**.
3. In the new InPrivate window, log into both Tallyfy and the external app, then attempt the integration setup.
</Steps>

#### Safari (Mac)
<Steps>
1. Click **File** in the top menu bar.
2. Select **New Private Window**.
3. In the new Private window, log into both Tallyfy and the external app, then attempt the integration setup.
</Steps>


### Additional troubleshooting steps

If private browsing doesn't resolve the connection issue, try these alternative solutions:

<Steps>
1. **Clear browser cache and cookies** completely in your regular browser, then attempt the connection in a normal (non-private) window.
2. **Disable browser extensions temporarily** (including ad blockers or privacy tools) that might interfere with the connection process.
3. **Use an alternative web browser** entirely for the integration setup process.
4. **Verify proper permissions** exist in both Tallyfy and the external application for establishing the connection.
</Steps>

### Contacting support

If these steps don't resolve the problem, [contact Tallyfy support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/) with details about the apps you're connecting and any error messages.
