## How can I use private browsing to connect Tallyfy to other apps?

When connecting Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> to external online tools (such as middleware, Slack, Google Drive, and other services), you may encounter login or authorization problems. These issues frequently stem from conflicting login information, cached data, or stored cookies in your regular browser session.

Utilizing your browser's **private browsing mode** (also called Incognito, InPrivate, or Private Window) often resolves these connection issues by providing a completely clean browsing session without accessing stored cookies, cached data, or saved login credentials.

### When should I use private browsing for app connections?

Consider using a private browsing window when you experience:
- Login errors during connection authorization attempts
- Repeated connection failures or timeout issues
- Specific troubleshooting requests from Tallyfy support
- Multiple account conflicts (e.g., different Google accounts) requiring clear account identification during connection setup

### What additional troubleshooting steps can I try?

<Steps>
1. **Clear browser cache and cookies** completely in your regular browser, then attempt the connection in a normal (non-private) window.
2. **Disable browser extensions temporarily** (including ad blockers or privacy tools) that might interfere with the connection process.
3. **Use an alternative web browser** entirely for the integration setup process.
4. **Verify proper permissions** exist in both Tallyfy and the external application for establishing the connection.
</Steps>
