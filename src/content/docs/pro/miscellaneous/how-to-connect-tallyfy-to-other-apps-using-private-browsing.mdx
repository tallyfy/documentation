## Using private browsing to connect Tallyfy to other applications

When connecting Tallyfy to third-party applications, you may occasionally encounter integration issues. Using a private browsing window often resolves these problems by:

- Eliminating cookie conflicts between applications
- Preventing authentication interference from existing sessions
- Ensuring a clean connection environment
- Bypassing cached credentials that may be outdated

### When to use private browsing

Use private browsing when:
- You receive authentication errors during integration
- Connections repeatedly fail or time out
- You're instructed to do so by Tallyfy support
- You're connecting to the same third-party service with multiple Tallyfy accounts

### Private browsing instructions by browser

#### Chrome

1. Open Google Chrome
2. Click the three-dot menu (⋮) in the top-right corner
3. Select **New Incognito Window**
4. Log into the third-party application you want to connect
5. Navigate to Tallyfy and initiate the connection process

:::note[Keyboard shortcuts]
Most browsers offer keyboard shortcuts for private browsing:

- Firefox: Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows/Linux) or Command+Shift+P (Mac)
- Safari: Command+Shift+N (Mac)

### Troubleshooting connection issues

If you still experience problems after using private browsing:

1. **Clear your browser cache** completely before trying again
2. **Disable browser extensions** that might interfere with authentication
3. **Try a different browser** altogether
4. **Check your permissions** in the third-party application
5. **Verify API access** is enabled for both applications

For persistent issues after implementing these troubleshooting steps, contact [Tallyfy support](https://tallyfy.com/contact-us/) with specific details about the integration being attempted.
