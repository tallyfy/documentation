## Using Private Browsing to Connect Tallyfy to Other Apps

Sometimes when you try to connect Tallyfy to another online tool (like Zapier, Slack, Google Drive, etc.), you might run into login or connection problems. Often, these problems are caused by leftover login information (cookies, cached data) stored in your regular web browser window.

Using your browser's **private browsing mode** (often called Incognito, InPrivate, or Private Window) can help fix these issues because it starts a clean session without using your stored cookies or saved logins.

### When should you try private browsing?

Try using a private browsing window to connect Tallyfy if:
- You get login errors when trying to authorize the connection.
- The connection keeps failing or timing out.
- Tallyfy support asks you to try it.
- You use multiple accounts for Tallyfy or the other app (e.g., different Google accounts) and need to make sure you're connecting the right ones.

### How to open a private browsing window

#### Chrome
<Steps>
1. Click the three-dot menu (⋮) in the top right.
2. Select **New Incognito Window**.
3. In the new Incognito window, log into Tallyfy and the other app you are connecting, then try setting up the integration again.
</Steps>

#### Firefox
<Steps>
1. Click the menu button (☰) in the top right.
2. Select **New Private Window**.
3. In the new Private window, log into Tallyfy and the other app, then try the integration setup.
</Steps>

#### Microsoft Edge
<Steps>
1. Click the three-dot menu (⋯) in the top right.
2. Select **New InPrivate window**.

</Steps>

#### Safari (Mac)
<Steps>

### Still having connection problems?

If using private browsing doesn't fix the connection issue:

<Steps>
1. Try **clearing your regular browser's cache and cookies** completely, then try again in a normal window.
2. Temporarily **disable browser extensions** (like ad blockers or privacy tools) that might be interfering.
3. Try using a **different web browser** entirely.
4. Double-check that you have the necessary **permissions** in both Tallyfy and the other application to make the connection.
</Steps>

If you've tried these steps and still can't connect, please [contact Tallyfy support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/) with details about the apps you're trying to connect and the errors you're seeing.
