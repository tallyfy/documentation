- You receive authentication errors during integration
- Connections repeatedly fail or time out
- You're instructed to do so by [Tallyfy support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/)
- You're connecting to the same third-party service with multiple Tallyfy accounts
