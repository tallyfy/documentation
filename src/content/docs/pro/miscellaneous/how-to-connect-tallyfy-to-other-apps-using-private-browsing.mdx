## Using private browsing to connect Tallyfy to other apps

Sometimes when connecting Tallyfy to another online tool (like Zapier, Slack, Google Drive, etc.), you might have login or connection problems. Often, these problems are caused by leftover login info (cookies, cached data) in your regular browser window.

Using your browser's **private browsing mode** (also called Incognito, InPrivate, or Private Window) can help because it gives you a clean session without using stored cookies or saved logins.

### When should you try private browsing?

Try using a private browsing window if:
- You get login errors when trying to authorize a connection.
- The connection fails repeatedly or times out.
- Tallyfy support asks you to try it.
- You use multiple accounts for Tallyfy or the other app (e.g., different Google accounts) and need to ensure you're connecting the correct accounts.

### How to open a private browsing window

#### Chrome
<Steps>
1. Click the three-dot menu (⋮) in the top right.
2. Select **New Incognito Window**.
3. In the new Incognito window, log in to Tallyfy and the other app, then try the integration setup again.
</Steps>

#### Firefox
<Steps>
1. Click the menu button (☰) in the top right.
2. Select **New Private Window**.
3. In the new Private window, log in to Tallyfy and the other app, then try setting up the integration.

#### Microsoft Edge
<Steps>
1. Click the three-dot menu (⋯) in the top right.
2. Select **New InPrivate window**.

#### Safari (Mac)
<Steps>

### Still having connection problems?

If using private browsing doesn't fix the connection issue:

<Steps>
1. Try **clearing your regular browser's cache and cookies** completely, then try again in a normal (non-private) window.
2. Temporarily **disable browser extensions** (like ad blockers or privacy tools) that could be interfering.
3. Try using a **completely different web browser**.
4. Double-check you have the needed **permissions** in both Tallyfy and the other application to set up the connection.
</Steps>

If you've tried these steps and still can't connect, please [contact Tallyfy support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/) with details about which apps you're trying to connect and the errors you see.
