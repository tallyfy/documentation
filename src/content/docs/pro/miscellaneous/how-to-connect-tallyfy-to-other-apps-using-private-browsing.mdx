## Using private browsing for app connections

When connecting Tallyfy to external tools like middleware, Slack, or Google Drive, you might hit login or authorization problems. These usually come from conflicting login info, cached data, or stored cookies in your regular browser session.

Your browser's **private browsing mode** (also called Incognito, InPrivate, or Private Window) fixes these issues by giving you a clean session - no stored cookies, cached data, or saved credentials.

### When to use private browsing

Open a private browsing window when you experience:
- Login errors during authorization
- Repeated connection failures or timeouts
- Troubleshooting requests from Tallyfy support
- Multiple account conflicts (e.g., different Google accounts) during connection setup

### Opening private browsing

#### Chrome
<Steps>
1. Click the three-dot menu (⋮) in the top right corner.
2. Select **New Incognito Window**.
3. Log into both Tallyfy and the external app, then retry the connection.
</Steps>

#### Firefox
<Steps>
1. Click the menu button (☰) in the top right corner.
2. Select **New Private Window**.
3. Log into both Tallyfy and the external app, then retry the connection.
</Steps>

#### Microsoft Edge
<Steps>
1. Click the three-dot menu (⋯) in the top right corner.
2. Select **New InPrivate window**.
3. Log into both Tallyfy and the external app, then retry the connection.
</Steps>

#### Safari (Mac)
<Steps>
1. Click **File** in the top menu bar.
2. Select **New Private Window**.
3. Log into both Tallyfy and the external app, then retry the connection.
</Steps>


### Additional troubleshooting steps

If private browsing doesn't fix the issue, try these alternatives:

<Steps>
1. **Clear browser cache and cookies** completely, then retry the connection in a normal window.
2. **Disable browser extensions temporarily** - ad blockers and privacy tools can interfere with authorization flows.
3. **Try a different browser** for the connection setup.
4. **Check permissions** in both Tallyfy and the external app to make sure they allow the connection.
</Steps>

### Contacting support

If none of these steps work, [contact Tallyfy support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/) with details about the apps you're connecting and any error messages you see.
