## What sets Tallyfy apart

Tallyfy combines exceptional human support, transparent pricing, and enterprise-grade security - all while remaining profitable and sustainable for the long haul. Here's what makes us genuinely different.

### Free 1:1 support for life

You get unlimited expert help at no extra cost. Forever. No support tiers, no premium fees - just real humans who actually help you succeed. Most vendors charge thousands for this level of support or hide behind ticket systems. We don't. Check our [customer reviews](https://www.capterra.com/p/143084/Tallyfy/) - they speak for themselves.

### Transparent pricing (no sales games)

Our [pricing](/products/pro/pricing/) is right there on the website. Calculate your exact costs instantly. No "contact sales" buttons, no qualification calls, no surprise fees. 

Everything's included too - SSO, unlimited guests, full API access. Competitors charge $500-5000 extra just for SSO. We think that's ridiculous.

### Built to last

We're profitable and self-funded. No VC pressure, no exit strategy, no "grow or die" mentality. Your processes and data are safe with a company that'll be here for decades, not just until the next funding round dries up. Learn more [about our philosophy](/products/pro/miscellaneous/about-tallyfy/).

### Your data, your way

Everything you can do in Tallyfy, you can do through our [API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/). Export all your data anytime. Connect to your [analytics tools](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/). No vendor lock-in whatsoever.

We're also the first workflow platform with [MCP server integration](/products/pro/integrations/mcp-server/) - ready for AI agents from day one.

### Security beyond the checkbox

Yes, we're [SOC 2 Type II certified](/products/pro/compliance/). But we're also:
- **HSTS compliant** for maximum transport security (rare in our industry)
- **BIMI compliant** for email authentication (we might be the only vendor with this)
- **GDPR, HIPAA-ready** with all the right controls

Most vendors stop at basic compliance. We go further because security isn't just a checkbox - it's fundamental.

### The practical difference

What does this mean for you?

**Lower costs**: Predictable pricing with everything included means no budget surprises.

**Faster setup**: Expert support gets you productive in hours, not months.

**Zero risk**: Our longevity and data portability eliminate vendor lock-in concerns.

**Future-ready**: AI-native architecture means you won't need to re-platform later.

**Peace of mind**: Enterprise security without enterprise complexity.

### Quick comparison

**vs. Legacy BPM platforms**: We're 10x faster to implement, no coding required, and cost a fraction of the price.

**vs. Project management tools**: We're built for repeatable processes, not one-off projects. Work flows automatically without manual coordination.

**vs. No-code platforms**: You don't build on Tallyfy - you use it. No technical skills needed, proven templates included, integrated analytics built-in.
