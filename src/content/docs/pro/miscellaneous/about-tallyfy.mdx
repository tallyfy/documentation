## Why do customers trust Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> for long-term workflow management?

### What proven track record does Tallyfy demonstrate?

Tallyfy has delivered continuous service to customers since 2015, building a reliable track record of platform stability and consistent product improvements over nearly a decade.

Unlike venture-backed software startups, Tallyfy operates profitably by default - making sure "we're never going bust" and can focus exclusively on serving customers for decades ahead. This sustainable business approach makes workflow management a dependable reality for organizations worldwide.

### How does Tallyfy's ownership structure benefit customers?

Tallyfy proudly operates as an independent company without venture capital backing, making sure customer interests stay paramount.

This independence means:
- Customers function as our board - we act exclusively in your long-term interests
- Zero pressure to sell or exit the company for investor returns
- Sustainable growth prioritizing product quality over market hype

### What specialized expertise drives Tallyfy's platform design?

Tallyfy's founders combine deep expertise in process improvement methodology with technical excellence, creating solutions that are rooted in real business understanding.

This platform is more than software built by programmers - it's designed by professionals who understand workflow optimization, operational efficiency, and authentic business requirements.

We've secured official US trademarks, showing our commitment to long-term platform development and protecting customers' investment in our technology.

### What enterprise-grade security standards does Tallyfy maintain?

Data security is our top concern and operational foundation.

Tallyfy maintains industry-leading security standards:
- [SOC 2 Type 2 compliance](/products/pro/compliance/) with comprehensive security controls and independent auditing
- [BIMI compliance](/products/pro/compliance/bimi-compliance/) for advanced email authentication — a standard most competitors don't achieve
- [HSTS compliance](/products/pro/compliance/hsts-compliance/) ensuring all connections use secure, encrypted protocols

### How does Tallyfy ensure fair, transparent pricing?

Tallyfy pioneered the [Fair Price Guarantee program](/products/pro/pricing/) within the workflow management sector, making enterprise-grade functionality accessible to organizations globally regardless of geographic location.

This approach prioritizes access democratization over revenue maximization — ensuring quality workflow tools reach organizations that need them most.

### Why does Tallyfy focus on substance over marketing noise?

Tallyfy deliberately avoids media attention and promotional hype, choosing substance over superficial marketing strategies.

Our organizational energy flows into building superior products and serving customers effectively, rather than chasing headlines or funding rounds.

### Why did Tallyfy choose independence over venture capital funding?

Industry statistics demonstrate significant risks associated with venture capital-backed companies:

- "As many as 75 percent of venture-backed companies never return cash to investors"<a href="https://www.hbs.edu/news/Pages/item.aspx?num=214" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><sup>[3]</sup></a> — Harvard Business School
- Approximately 35% of Series A startups fail before reaching Series B<a href="https://www.luisazhou.com/blog/startup-failure-statistics" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
- When VC-backed firms are sold to private equity, customers often face "higher prices, fees, and declining service"<a href="https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/private-equity-is-out-of-control-and-looting-america-this-prosecutor-says-we-can-fix-it" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><sup>[5]</sup></a>

By maintaining independence, Tallyfy avoids pressures that compromise customer value:
- Chasing unsustainable growth that sacrifices product quality
- Prioritizing investor returns over customer needs and satisfaction
- Risking sudden shutdowns (Series A closures increased 61% in Q1 2024)<a href="https://carta.com/data/startup-shutdowns-q1-2024/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
- Compromising product quality to meet aggressive investor targets

Customer success drives our success — and Tallyfy's structure ensures this alignment remains permanent.
