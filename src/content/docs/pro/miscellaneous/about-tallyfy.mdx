## Why customers trust Tallyfy<sup>®</sup>

### Proven track record since 2015

Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> has been serving customers continuously since 2015, building a track record of reliability and consistent improvement. Unlike many software startups, we're profitable by default — meaning we're "never going bust" and can focus on serving you for decades to come. This sustainable approach makes Workflow Made Easy<sup>®</sup> a reality for organizations worldwide.

### Customer-first ownership structure

We're proud to be an independent company without venture capital backing. This means:
- You, the customer, are our board — we act only in your long-term interest
- No pressure to sell or flip the company for quick returns
- Sustainable growth focused on product quality, not hype

### Deep expertise you can rely on

Our founders bring real expertise in process improvement and technical excellence. This isn't just software built by programmers — it's a platform designed by people who understand workflows, efficiency, and what businesses actually need.

We've secured [official US trademarks](https://tallyfy.com/legal/trademarks/)<a href="https://tallyfy.com/legal/trademarks/" target="_blank"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, demonstrating our commitment to long-term thinking and protecting our customers' investment in our platform.

### Enterprise-grade security and compliance

Your data security is paramount. Tallyfy maintains:
- [SOC 2 Type 2 compliance](/products/pro/compliance/) with comprehensive security controls
- [BIMI compliance](/products/pro/compliance/bimi-compliance/) for email authentication — a standard most competitors lack
- [HSTS compliance](/products/pro/compliance/hsts-compliance/) ensuring all connections are secure

### Fair, transparent pricing

We pioneered the [Fair Price Guarantee program](/products/pro/pricing/) in our sector, making enterprise workflow management accessible to organizations worldwide. This isn't about maximizing revenue — it's about democratizing access to quality workflow tools.

### Focused on substance, not noise

We have no desire to make noise in the media or attract the wrong kind of attention. Our energy goes into building better products and serving customers, not chasing headlines or raising rounds.

### Why we chose independence over venture capital

The statistics speak for themselves about VC-backed companies:

- "As many as 75 percent of venture-backed companies never return cash to investors"<a href="https://www.hbs.edu/news/Pages/item.aspx?num=214" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><sup>[3]</sup></a> — Harvard Business School
- Approximately 35% of Series A startups fail before reaching Series B<a href="https://www.luisazhou.com/blog/startup-failure-statistics" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
- When VC-backed firms are sold to private equity, customers often face "higher prices, fees, and declining service"<a href="https://www.ineteconomics.org/perspectives/blog/private-equity-is-out-of-control-and-looting-america-this-prosecutor-says-we-can-fix-it" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><sup>[5]</sup></a>

By remaining independent, we avoid the pressure to:
- Chase unsustainable growth at all costs
- Prioritize investor returns over customer needs  
- Risk sudden shutdowns (Series A closures increased 61% in Q1 2024)<a href="https://carta.com/data/startup-shutdowns-q1-2024/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><sup>[6]</sup></a>
- Compromise on quality to meet aggressive targets

Your success is our success — and we're structured to ensure it stays that way.
