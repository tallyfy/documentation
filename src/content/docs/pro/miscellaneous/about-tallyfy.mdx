## Why you can trust Tallyfy with your workflows

### Track record of stability

Tallyfy has operated continuously since 2015 as a profitable, independent company. Nine years in SaaS isn't just survival - it's proof we know how to build something that lasts. While competitors chase venture capital and burn through funding, we've stayed focused on building a sustainable business that serves customers, not investors.

### Your data belongs to you

We believe in complete data ownership and portability. You can [export all your process data to CSV](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/how-can-i-export-tallyfy-processes-to-csv/) anytime - every task, form field, comment, and timestamp. Our [REST API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/) provides full programmatic access to extract, backup, or migrate your data. We even maintain [open source migration scripts](https://github.com/tallyfy/migrator)<a href="https://github.com/tallyfy/migrator" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>[1]</sup></a> to help you move data in from 15+ other platforms. Your workflows are yours - we just help you run them better.

### Integration-first architecture

Tallyfy works with what you already have. Our API-first design means every feature in our interface is available through the [REST API](/products/pro/integrations/open-api/). We support [middleware platforms](/products/pro/integrations/middleware/) like Zapier, Make.com, Power Automate, and n8n for code-free integrations. Check our [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/tallyfy)<a href="https://github.com/tallyfy" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><sup>[2]</sup></a> for integration tools, API support, and migration scripts - all open source. We don't lock you in; we connect you out.

### Built to stay independent

Here's what sets us apart: we have zero intention of selling Tallyfy. No exit strategy. No flip. The founders built this company to run it, not to cash out. As an independent company without venture capital:
- Customer needs drive every product decision
- No pressure to sell or exit for investor returns
- Focus on sustainable growth over growth-at-all-costs
- Direct accountability to users, not a board of investors

We've watched too many good products get acquired and ruined. That won't happen here.

### Security you can verify

Tallyfy maintains:
- [SOC 2 Type 2 compliance](/products/pro/compliance/) with independent auditing
- [BIMI compliance](/products/pro/compliance/bimi-compliance/) for email authentication
- [HSTS compliance](/products/pro/compliance/hsts-compliance/) for encrypted connections
- Complete audit trails for every action
- Enterprise-grade encryption at rest and in transit

### Fair, transparent pricing

Our [Fair Price Guarantee program](/products/pro/pricing/) ensures consistent pricing regardless of geographic location. No surprise price hikes, no bait-and-switch tactics, no "call us for enterprise pricing" games. The price you see is the price you pay.
