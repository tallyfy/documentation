## How to find organization, template, and process IDs

The Organization, Template, and [Process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) IDs are unique identification numbers for each organization, [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), and process in Tallyfy. These IDs are useful when contacting [support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/) or importing templates.

These IDs can be found in the URLs of various pages:

1. **Organization ID**
You can find it on your [organization\'s settings](/products/pro/settings/org-settings/).

2. **Template ID**
You can find your template\'s ID by clicking **Config** on the template editor. and heading to the **Tools** section.


3. **Process ID**
Similar to the Template ID, the Process ID follows the Organization ID in the URL. After https://go.tallyfy.com/ORGID/processes/PROCESSID, you\'ll see the ID when you open or [launch](/products/pro/launching/) the associated process. Each process has its own unique ID!
