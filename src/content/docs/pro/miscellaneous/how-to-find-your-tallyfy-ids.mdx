## How to find your Organization, Template, and Process IDs

Everything in Tallyfy has a unique ID number. Sometimes, you might need these IDs, for example, when contacting Tallyfy [support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/) or when setting up certain [integrations](/products/pro/integrations/) like importing templates.

Here's how to find the main IDs:

1.  **Organization ID**
    *   Go to **Settings** > **Organization**.
    *   Your Organization ID is displayed there.
        ![Organization ID shown in Settings](https://screenshots.tallyfy.com/tallyfy%2Fpro%2Fdesktop-light-show-org-id.png)

2.  **Template ID**
    *   Open the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in **Edit** mode.
    *   Click the **Settings** (or **Config**) button in the top toolbar.
    *   Go to the **Export** tab (or sometimes called **Tools**).
    *   The Template ID is displayed there, along with the Org ID.

3.  **Process ID**
    *   Open a specific running [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).
    *   Look at the web address (URL) in your browser's address bar.
    *   The URL will look something like `https://go.tallyfy.com/[ORG_ID]/processes/[PROCESS_ID]`.
    *   The part after `/processes/` is the unique ID for *that specific run* of the process.
