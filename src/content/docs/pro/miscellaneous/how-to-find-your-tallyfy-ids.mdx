## Finding your Tallyfy IDs

Every element within Tallyfy possesses a unique identification number that serves various administrative and technical purposes across the platform.

These unique IDs prove essential when contacting Tallyfy [support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/) for assistance, configuring specific [integrations](/products/pro/integrations/) including template imports, or performing advanced workflow management tasks requiring precise system identification.

### Locating the main Tallyfy IDs

#### Finding your Organization ID

*   Navigate to **Settings** > **Organization**.
*   Your Organization ID is clearly displayed in this section.

#### Finding a Template ID

*   Open the desired [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in **Edit** mode.
*   Click the **Settings** (or **Config**) button in the top toolbar.
*   Navigate to the **Export** tab (sometimes labeled **Tools**).
*   The Template ID is displayed in this section, along with the Organization ID.

#### Finding a Process ID

*   Open a specific running [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).
*   Examine the web address (URL) in your browser's address bar.
*   The URL follows this format: `https://go.tallyfy.com/[ORG_ID]/processes/[PROCESS_ID]`.
*   The segment after `/processes/` represents the unique ID for *that specific process instance*.
