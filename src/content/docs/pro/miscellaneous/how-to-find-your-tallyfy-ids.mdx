## Finding your Tallyfy IDs

Every element in Tallyfy has a unique ID. You'll need these IDs when contacting [support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/), setting up [integrations](/products/pro/integrations/), or importing templates.

### Organization ID

*   Go to **Settings** > **Organization**.
*   Your Organization ID is displayed in this section.

### Template ID

*   Open the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) in **Edit** mode.
*   Click the **Settings** (or **Config**) button in the top toolbar.
*   Go to the **Export** tab (sometimes labeled **Tools**).
*   The Template ID is shown here, along with the Organization ID.

### Process ID

*   Open a running [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).
*   Look at the URL in your browser's address bar.
*   The URL follows this format: `https://go.tallyfy.com/[ORG_ID]/processes/[PROCESS_ID]`.
*   The part after `/processes/` is the unique ID for *that specific process instance*.
