## Where to find your Tallyfy IDs

Finding these IDs is super easy! Just take a look at the URLs on each page. We've made it simple for you with this visual guide:

1. **Organization ID**
You can find it on your organization's settings.

2. **Template ID**
You can find your template's ID by clicking **Config** on the template editor. and heading to the **Tools** section.


3. **Process ID**
Similar to the Template ID, the Process ID follows the Organization ID in the URL. After https://go.tallyfy.com/ORGID/processes/PROCESSID, you'll see the ID when you open or launch the associated process. Each process has its own unique ID!

Finding and using these IDs is a breeze! Contact support or share templates confidently with your partner business. Hooray for simple identification!
