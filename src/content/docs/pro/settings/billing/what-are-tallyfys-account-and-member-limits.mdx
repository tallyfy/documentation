## What are Tallyfy's account and member limits

Tallyfy Account and Member Limits

Every Tallyfy account comes with a set number of members included. Let's break it down for you:

- PRO PLAN: 4 members included
- DOCS PLAN: 10 members included

### Trial Plan Limits

If you're on a Tallyfy trial, you have the following limits:

- 10 members
- 10 guests
- 100 total task assignments of all kinds
- 10 active processes

If you find these trial limits restrictive, you can contact Tallyfy support with a note explaining your needs. The support team may consider lifting certain trial limits based on your specific requirements.

Now, it's important to note that members are employees or people within your company who have access to Tallyfy. Guest users, on the other hand, are free and unlimited. They can be clients invited to fill out a form or perform a specific task in a process.
