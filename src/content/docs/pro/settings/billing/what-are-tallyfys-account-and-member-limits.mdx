## Account and member limits

Tallyfy has two [member roles](/products/pro/documenting/members/) with different capabilities:

*   **Full Members** - Can access all features, including creating and editing [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). Includes Admin and Standard roles.
*   **Light Members** - Can only complete assigned [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) and participate in launched processes. They **can't** create or edit templates.

An optional Data Feed add-on for [Tallyfy Analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/) is also available.

### Member role capabilities

| Feature                     | Light Member | Full Member |
| --------------------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Create/edit templates       | No           | Yes         |
| Launch/assign processes     | Yes          | Yes         |

### Trial plan limits

Tallyfy's free 14-day trial has these limits:

*   10 [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) per account
*   10 [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) per account
*   100 total [task assignments](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) across all processes
*   10 [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) running at the same time

If these limits affect your evaluation, [contact Tallyfy support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/) to discuss an extension.

### Members vs. guests

*   **Members** - People in your organization (employees, contractors). They're assigned Full or Light roles.
*   **Guests** - People outside your organization (clients, vendors, partners) who only complete specific [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/). Guest access is **unlimited** and free.

:::note[External domains for partners and consultants]
If external partners or consultants need access to your Tallyfy account, add their company's email domain (e.g., `consultingfirm.com`) to an exclusion list in your Account settings. This marks users with that domain as external collaborators. See [Become a Tallyfy Partner](/products/pro/miscellaneous/how-can-i-become-a-tallyfy-partner/) for details.
