## What are Tallyfy's account and member limits

Tallyfy Account and Member Limits

Every Tallyfy account comes with a set number of members included. Let's break it down for you:

- PRO PLAN: 4 members included
- DOCS PLAN: 10 members included

Now, it's important to note that members are employees or people within your company who have access to Tallyfy. Guest users, on the other hand, are free and unlimited. They can be clients invited to fill out a form or perform a specific task in a process.
