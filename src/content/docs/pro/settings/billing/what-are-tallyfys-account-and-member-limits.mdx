A Data Feed option is available for $20 per member per annum, which feeds Tallyfy data to your BI or [analytics platform](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/).

### Trial Plan Limits

If you're on a Tallyfy trial, you have the following limits:

- 10 [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/)
- 10 [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/)
- 100 total [task assignments](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) of all kinds
- 10 [active processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)

If you find these trial limits restrictive, you can [contact Tallyfy support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/) with a note explaining your needs. The support team may consider lifting certain trial limits based on your specific requirements.

### Members vs. Guests

- **Members**: Employees or people within your company who have access to Tallyfy. Billing is based on member type (Full or Light).
- **Guests**: External users with free and unlimited access. They can be clients invited to fill out a [form](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) or perform a specific [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).

:::note[Domain Exclusion for Partners]
Organizations can set up domain exclusion lists to mark specific email domains as "Unbilled" for billing purposes. This is particularly useful when working with Tallyfy partners or consultants.
