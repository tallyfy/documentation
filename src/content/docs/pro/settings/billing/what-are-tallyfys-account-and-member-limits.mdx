## Account and member limits

### Member roles

Tallyfy offers two distinct [member roles](/products/pro/documenting/members/) with differentiated capabilities:

*   **Full Members**: Can access all platform features, including creating and editing [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). This category includes Admin and Standard roles.
*   **Light Members**: Can only complete assigned [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) and participate in launched processes. They **cannot** create or edit templates.

An optional Data Feed add-on for [Tallyfy Analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/) is also available.

### Member role capabilities

| Feature                     | Light Member | Full Member |
| --------------------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Create/Edit Templates       | No           | Yes         |
| Launch/Assign Processes     | Yes          | Yes         |
| Complete/Track Tasks        | Yes          | Yes         |

| Watch Templates/Processes   | Yes          | Yes         |

### Trial plan limits

During the free trial period, Tallyfy trial accounts have these specific limits:

*   Maximum 10 [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) allowed per account
*   Maximum 10 [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) permitted per account
*   Maximum 100 total [task assignments](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) across all processes
*   Maximum 10 processes running simultaneously ([processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/))

If these limits impact your trial evaluation, or if you require more than the standard 14-day trial period, please [contact Tallyfy support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/) to discuss a possible extension.

### Members vs. guests

*   **Members**: People within your organization using Tallyfy (e.g., employees, contractors). Members are assigned roles based on their needs (Full or Light).
*   **Guests**: People outside your organization (e.g., clients, vendors, partners) who only complete specific [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/). Guest access is **unlimited**.

:::note[External domains for partners and consultants]
If you work with external partners or consultants who need access to your Tallyfy account, you can add their company's email domain (e.g., `consultingfirm.com`) to an exclusion list in your Account settings. This configuration marks users with that email domain as external collaborators. See [Become a Tallyfy Partner](/products/pro/miscellaneous/how-can-i-become-a-tallyfy-partner/) for details.
