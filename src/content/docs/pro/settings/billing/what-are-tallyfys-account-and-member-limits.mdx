## Understand member roles, pricing, and usage limits

### Member roles and pricing

Tallyfy offers two types of [member roles](/products/pro/documenting/members/) with specific pricing:

- **Full Members**: $300 per annum
- **Light Members**: $50 per annum

A Data Feed option is available for $20 per member per annum, which feeds Tallyfy data to your BI or [analytics platform](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/).

### Role capabilities

### Trial plan limits

If you're on a Tallyfy trial, you have the following limits:

- 10 [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/)
- 10 [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/)
- 100 total [task assignments](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) of all kinds
- 10 [active processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)

If you find these trial limits restrictive, you can [contact Tallyfy support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/) with a note explaining your needs. The support team may consider lifting certain trial limits based on your specific requirements.

### Members vs. guests

- **Members**: Employees or people within your company who have access to Tallyfy. Billing is based on member type (Full or Light).
- **Guests**: External users with free and unlimited access. They can be clients invited to fill out a [form](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/what-are-form-fields-in-tallyfy/) or perform a specific [task](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) in a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/).

:::note[Domain Exclusion for Partners]
Organizations can set up domain exclusion lists to mark specific email domains as "Unbilled" for billing purposes. This is particularly useful when working with Tallyfy partners or consultants. For more information, see [Become a Tallyfy Partner](/products/pro/miscellaneous/how-can-i-become-a-tallyfy-partner/).
