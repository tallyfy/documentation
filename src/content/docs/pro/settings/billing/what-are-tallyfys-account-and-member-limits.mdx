## What are Tallyfy's account and member limits?

:::warning[Enterprise and Large Company Pricing]
Tallyfy has entirely separate pricing and customized terms with enterprises and large companies. None of the information on this website or in the documentation manual may apply to enterprises and large companies - especially if any custom agreements have been or are entered into the past or present.

### How do member roles and pricing work in Tallyfy?

Tallyfy<sup>Â®</sup> offers two distinct paid [member roles](/products/pro/documenting/members/) with differentiated pricing structures (see the [pricing page](/products/pro/pricing/) for current details):

*   **Full Members**: Can access all platform features, including creating and editing [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). This category includes Admin and Standard roles with comprehensive capabilities.
*   **Light Members**: Can only complete assigned [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) and participate in launched processes. They **cannot** create or edit templates and cost significantly less than Full Members.

An optional Data Feed add-on for [Tallyfy Analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/) is also available for an additional cost per member per year.

### What are the trial plan limits in Tallyfy?

During the free trial period, Tallyfy trial accounts have these specific limits:

*   Maximum 10 [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) allowed per account
*   Maximum 10 [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) permitted per account
*   Maximum 100 total [task assignments](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) across all processes
*   Maximum 10 processes running simultaneously ([processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/))

If these limits impact your trial evaluation, or if you require more than the standard 14-day trial period, please [contact Tallyfy support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/) to discuss a possible extension.

### What's the difference between members and guests?

*   **Members**: People within your organization using Tallyfy (e.g., employees, contractors). You pay for member licenses based on their assigned role (Full or Light).
*   **Guests**: People outside your organization (e.g., clients, vendors, partners) who only complete specific [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/). Guest access is **completely free and unlimited**.

:::note[Unbilled domains for partners and consultants]
If you work with external partners or consultants who need access to your Tallyfy account, you can add their company's email domain (e.g., `consultingfirm.com`) to an exclusion list in your Billing settings. This configuration marks users with that email domain as "Unbilled", so they don't count towards your paid member licenses. See [Become a Tallyfy Partner](/products/pro/miscellaneous/how-can-i-become-a-tallyfy-partner/) for comprehensive details.
