## Understanding account and member limits

### Member roles and pricing

Tallyfy has two main paid [member roles](/products/pro/documenting/members/) with different prices (see the [pricing page](/products/pro/pricing/) for current details):

*   **Full Members**: Can use all features, including creating and editing [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/). (This includes Admin and Standard roles).
*   **Light Members**: Can only complete assigned [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) and take part in launched processes. They **cannot** create or edit templates and cost less than Full Members.

An optional Data Feed add-on for [Tallyfy Analytics](/products/pro/integrations/analytics/) is also available for an extra cost per member per year.

### What each role can do

| Feature                     | Light Member | Full Member |
| --------------------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Create/Edit Templates       | No           | Yes         |
| Launch/Assign Processes     | Yes          | Yes         |
| Complete/Track Tasks        | Yes          | Yes         |
| Get Reminders               | Yes          | Yes         |
| Watch Templates/Processes   | Yes          | Yes         |

### Trial plan limits

During the free trial, Tallyfy accounts have these limits:

*   Maximum 10 [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/).
*   Maximum 10 [guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/).
*   Maximum 100 total [task assignments](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/).
*   Maximum 10 processes running at the same time ([processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/)).

If these limits affect your trial evaluation, please [contact Tallyfy support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/).

### Members vs. guests

*   **Members**: People inside your organization using Tallyfy (e.g., employees). You pay for member licenses based on their role (Full or Light).
*   **Guests**: People outside your organization (e.g., clients, vendors) who only complete specific [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/). Guest access is **free and unlimited**.

:::note[Unbilled domains for partners and consultants]
If you work with external partners or consultants who need access to your Tallyfy account, you can add their company's email domain (e.g., `consultingfirm.com`) to an exclusion list in your Billing settings. This marks users with that email domain as "Unbilled", so they don't count towards your paid member licenses. See [Become a Tallyfy Partner](/products/pro/miscellaneous/how-can-i-become-a-tallyfy-partner/) for more details.
