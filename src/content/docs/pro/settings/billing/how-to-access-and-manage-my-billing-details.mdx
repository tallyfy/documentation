## Managing billing notification frequency

By default, Tallyfy sends real-time billing notifications whenever changes occur that affect your billing, such as when members join or get disabled. If you're receiving too many notifications, you have options:

### Requesting daily billing

If your organization frequently adds or removes members, you might prefer to receive consolidated billing updates:

1. Contact Tallyfy Support through the help widget or by sending an email
2. Request to switch from real-time to daily billing
3. Once approved, your billing will update just once per day instead of in real-time

This change can significantly reduce the number of billing notifications you receive while still keeping you informed of important changes to your account.

## Redeeming discount coupon codes

If you've received a coupon code for the Fair Price Guarantee program or any other special discount, here's how to apply it:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Billing**
2. Click the **Update Plan** button
3. In the checkout process, look for the field labeled "Have a coupon?"
4. Enter your coupon code exactly as provided
5. Complete the checkout process to apply your discount

If you want to apply for the Fair Price Guarantee discount, you must first visit [https://tallyfy.com/pricing/fair-price-guarantee/](https://tallyfy.com/pricing/fair-price-guarantee/), carefully read all instructions, and complete the application. Once approved, you'll receive a coupon code to use during the upgrade process.

That's it! You now have easy access to all your billing details, making it simpler than ever to keep track of your plan, invoices, and payments.
