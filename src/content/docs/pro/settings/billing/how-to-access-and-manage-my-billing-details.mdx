## How to access and manage billing details

In this article, we'll guide you through accessing and managing your billing details. Tallyfy uses Recurly as its billing system along with a credit system for managing payments and refunds.

To access billing details:

1. Click on **Settings** at the bottom of the left sidebar.
2. Once you're in Settings, click on **Billing**. Here, you'll find all the information related to your billing.

3. In the Billing section, you'll be able to edit your payment card, view all billing history, manage your credits, change your current plan and billing details, and even access a link to allow someone else to pay for you!

## Understanding the credit system

Tallyfy utilizes a credit system that functions like a bank account balance:

- Credits are used before charging your backup payment card
- Pro-rated credits are applied when you disable members or change roles
- Credits have a 5-year expiration period
- Credits can be used for licenses and add-ons, but not professional services
- Credits are not refundable as cash
- Credits are available for purchase via ACH/wire transfer

### When credits are applied

- **Member activation**: Billing starts when members activate their account by accepting the invite or signing in via SSO
- **Member disabling**: When you disable a member, you receive pro-rated credits for unused time on your plan
- **Role changes**: When changing a member's role (upgrading or downgrading), billing adjusts in real-time with appropriate credits or charges

## Managing billing notification frequency

By default, Tallyfy sends real-time billing notifications whenever changes occur that affect your billing, such as when members join or get disabled. If you're receiving too many notifications, you have options:

### Requesting daily billing

If your organization frequently adds or removes members, you might prefer to receive consolidated billing updates:

1. Contact Tallyfy Support through the help widget or by sending an email
2. Request to switch from real-time to daily billing
3. Once approved, your billing will update just once per day instead of in real-time

This change can significantly reduce the number of billing notifications you receive while still keeping you informed of important changes to your account.

## Redeeming discount coupon codes

If you've received a coupon code for the Fair Price Guarantee program or any other special discount, here's how to apply it:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Billing**
2. Click the **Update Plan** button
3. In the checkout process, look for the field labeled "Have a coupon?"
4. Enter your coupon code exactly as provided
5. Complete the checkout process to apply your discount
