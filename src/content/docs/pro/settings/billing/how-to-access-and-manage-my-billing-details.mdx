</Steps>

### Viewing history and updating payment method

From the main **Billing** screen:

*   Click **View Billing History** to see past invoices and a plan summary.
*   Click **Edit Payment Card** to update your saved credit or debit card details.

:::note[Keep a payment card on file]
You need a valid payment card saved even if you have pre-paid credits. This ensures your service continues without interruption if credits run out.

### Understanding the credit system

The billing section shows your current credit balance. Tallyfy uses a credit system where credits are applied before your card is charged. See the [main Billing overview](/products/pro/settings/billing/) for a full explanation of how credits work.

### Changing how often you get billing notifications

By default, billing emails are sent instantly when changes occur. To get fewer emails:

<Steps>
1. [Contact Tallyfy Support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/).
2. Ask to switch your account to **daily billing updates**.
3. Once enabled, you'll get one daily summary email covering all billing changes from that day.
</Steps>

### Using discount coupon codes

If you have a valid discount code:

<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings** > **Billing**.
2. Click **Update Plan** (or a similar button for managing your subscription).
3. During the checkout process, find the "Have a coupon?" field and enter your code.
4. Complete the checkout; the discount will apply to your payment.
</Steps>
