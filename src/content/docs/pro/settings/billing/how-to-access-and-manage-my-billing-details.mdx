</Steps>

### View history and update payment

From the **Billing** screen:

*   Click **View Billing History** for past invoices and a plan summary.
*   Click **Edit Payment Card** to update your credit or debit card.

:::note[Keep a payment card on file]
You need a valid card saved even if you have pre-paid credits. This keeps your service running if credits run out.
:::

### Change the billing contact

The user who created the organization is the default billing contact. To change it or add CC email addresses:

<Steps>
1.  [Contact Tallyfy Support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/).
2.  Provide your **[Organization ID](/products/pro/miscellaneous/how-to-find-your-tallyfy-ids/)**.
3.  Specify the new billing contact email address(es).
</Steps>

### Change your plan

<Steps>
1.  Go to **Settings** > **Billing**.
2.  Click **Update Plan**.
3.  Select your desired plan and billing cycle (annual or monthly).
4.  Confirm and complete checkout.
</Steps>

### Credit system

Your credit balance appears in the billing section. Credits are applied before your card is charged. See the [Billing overview](/products/pro/settings/billing/) for details on how credits work.

### Billing notification frequency

Billing emails (invoices, payment confirmations, subscription updates) are sent instantly by default. To receive fewer emails:

<Steps>
1. [Contact Tallyfy Support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/).
2. Ask to switch to **daily billing updates**.
3. You'll then get one daily summary instead of individual emails.
</Steps>

### Use discount coupon codes

<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings** > **Billing**.
2. Click **Update Plan**.
3. Enter your code in the "Have a coupon?" field during checkout.
4. Complete checkout - the discount applies to your payment.
</Steps>

:::note[Applying for the Fair Price Guarantee discount]
You must first apply through the [Fair Price Guarantee page](https://tallyfy.com/pricing/fair-price-guarantee/) and receive an approved coupon code from Tallyfy.
:::

### Cancel your subscription

Use the self-service cancellation form in Tallyfy when possible.

:::tip[Emergency cancellation process]
**If you can't access the cancellation form** (technical issues or location restrictions):

1. **Email support** at support@tallyfy.com from your registered email
2. **Include** your organization name, billing email, and reason for cancellation
3. **Request** written confirmation of cancellation and final billing status
4. Support typically processes urgent cancellations within 24 hours

Cancellation takes effect at the end of your current billing period. You keep access until then.
:::

### What happens if I miss a payment?

1. Immediate email notification
2. After 7 days: read-only mode (view and export only)
3. After 14 days: access suspended
4. After 30 days: Tallyfy reserves the right to delete data

Fix this by updating your card in **Settings > Billing > Edit Payment Card** or [contact support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/).

### Data retention after cancellation or deletion

- **30-day export window** after termination
- **90-day backup retention** after deletion (recovery may be possible)
- **Permanent deletion** after 90 days from all systems
