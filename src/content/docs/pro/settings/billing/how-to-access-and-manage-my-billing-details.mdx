</Steps>

### Viewing history and updating payment method

From the main **Billing** screen:

*   Click **View Billing History** to see past invoices and a plan summary.
*   Click **Edit Payment Card** to update your saved credit or debit card.

:::note[Keep a Payment Card on File]
You need a valid payment card saved even if you have pre-paid credits. This ensures uninterrupted service if credits run out.

### Understanding the credit system

Tallyfy uses billing credits like a pre-paid balance:

*   Credits are used automatically before charging your card.
*   You receive pro-rated credits for unused time if you remove or downgrade members mid-plan.
*   Credits expire after 5 years and are non-refundable.
*   Contact Tallyfy to purchase credits via bank transfer.

Billing adjusts automatically based on member changes.

### Changing how often you get billing notifications

By default, billing emails are sent instantly for changes. To receive fewer emails:

<Steps>
1. [Contact Tallyfy Support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/).
2. Request to switch your account to **daily billing updates**.
3. Once enabled, you'll receive one daily summary email for billing changes.
</Steps>

### Using discount coupon codes

If you have a discount code:

<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings** > **Billing**.
2. Click **Update Plan** (or a similar subscription management button).
3. During checkout, enter the code in the "Have a coupon?" field.
4. Complete the checkout process; the discount will be applied.
</Steps>
