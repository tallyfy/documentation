## Accessing and managing billing details

This guide demonstrates how administrators can access, view, and manage Tallyfy billing details through the subscription interface.

Effective billing management ensures accurate subscription oversight, payment method maintenance, and financial record keeping.

To find your billing information:

<Steps>
1. Click **Settings** (usually at the bottom left).
2. Click **Billing** in the **Settings** menu.

</Steps>

### Viewing history and updating payment method

From the main **Billing** screen:

*   Click **View Billing History** to see past invoices and a plan summary.
*   Click **Edit Payment Card** to update your saved credit or debit card details.

:::note[Keep a payment card on file]
You need a valid payment card saved even if you have pre-paid credits. This ensures your service continues without interruption if credits run out.

### Changing the Billing Contact

The Tallyfy user who initially created the organization's account is set as the primary billing contact by default. To change the primary billing contact or to add additional email addresses to receive billing communications:

<Steps>
1.  [Contact Tallyfy Support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/).
2.  Provide your **[Organization ID](/products/pro/miscellaneous/how-to-find-your-tallyfy-ids/)**.
3.  Clearly state the email address(es) you want to set as the billing contact(s).
</Steps>

### Changing your plan

To change your subscription plan (e.g., upgrade or change billing frequency):
<Steps>
1.  Go to **Settings** > **Billing**.
2.  Click the **Update Plan** button (or similar, the button text may vary slightly).
3.  You will be taken to a screen to select your desired plan and billing cycle (annual/monthly).
4.  Confirm your selection and complete the checkout process.
</Steps>

### Understanding the credit system

The billing section shows your current credit balance. Tallyfy uses a credit system where credits are applied before your card is charged. See the [main Billing overview](/products/pro/settings/billing/) for a full explanation of how credits work.

### Changing how often you get billing notifications

By default, billing emails (like invoices, payment confirmations, and subscription updates) are sent instantly when changes occur. To get fewer emails:

<Steps>
1. [Contact Tallyfy Support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/).
2. Ask to switch your account to **daily billing updates**.
3. Once enabled, you'll get one daily summary email covering all billing changes from that day.
</Steps>

### Using discount coupon codes

If you have a valid discount code:

<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings** > **Billing**.
2. Click **Update Plan** (or a similar button for managing your subscription).
3. During the checkout process, find the "Have a coupon?" field and enter your code.
4. Complete the checkout; the discount will apply to your payment.
</Steps>

:::note[Applying for the Fair Price Guarantee discount]
To get the Fair Price Guarantee discount, you must first apply through the [Fair Price Guarantee page](https://tallyfy.com/pricing/fair-price-guarantee/) and receive an approved coupon code from Tallyfy.
:::

### Canceling your subscription

To cancel your Tallyfy subscription, use the self-service cancellation form when possible. The standard cancellation process ensures proper account closure and final billing.

:::tip[Emergency cancellation process]
**If you cannot access the standard cancellation form** due to technical issues or location restrictions:

1. **Email support directly** - Send your cancellation request to support@tallyfy.com from your registered account email
2. **Include account details** - Provide your organization name, billing email, and reason for cancellation
3. **Request confirmation** - Ask for written confirmation of cancellation and final billing status
4. **Response time** - Support typically processes urgent cancellations within 24 hours

**Important**: Cancellation takes effect at the end of your current billing period. You'll retain access until then.
:::

### What happens if I miss a payment?

1. Immediate notification via email
2. After 7 days: read-only mode (view and export only)
3. After 14 days: access suspended
4. After 30 days: Tallyfy reserves the right to delete data

Update payment info in **Settings > Billing > Edit Payment Card** or [contact support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/).

### Data retention after cancellation or deletion

- **30-day export window** after termination
- **90-day backup retention** after deletion (recovery may be possible)
- **Permanent deletion** after 90 days from all systems
