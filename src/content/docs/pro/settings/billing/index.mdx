## Billing and payment management

The billing section in Tallyfy provides tools to manage all aspects of your subscription, payment methods, and account limits. This section covers:

### Managing your subscription

Access your billing dashboard to:
- View your current plan details
- Update payment methods
- Change billing cycles (monthly/annual)
- View past invoices and payment history
- Add or remove user licenses

For detailed instructions, see [How to access and manage billing details](/products/pro/settings/billing/how-to-access-and-manage-my-billing-details/).

### Billing notification frequency

By default, Tallyfy sends real-time billing notifications when changes occur that affect your billing, such as when members join or get disabled. If you're receiving too many notifications, you can request a change to your billing notification frequency:

- **Real-time billing** (default): Receive immediate notifications and billing updates whenever changes occur
- **Daily billing**: Updates to billing happen just once a day, consolidating all changes

:::note[Requesting daily billing]
If you prefer to receive fewer billing notifications, you can contact Tallyfy support and request to switch from real-time to daily billing. This is especially helpful for organizations that frequently add or remove members.

### Account and member limits

Each Tallyfy plan includes specific limits on:
- Number of full members allowed
- Number of light members allowed
- Storage allocation for attachments
- Process limits (if applicable)

For a complete breakdown of limits by plan type, see [Tallyfy's account and member limits](/products/pro/settings/billing/what-are-tallyfys-account-and-member-limits/).
