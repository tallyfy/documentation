## Billing overview

The **Billing** section in Settings lets administrators manage subscriptions, payment methods, account limits, and billing.

Tallyfy uses Recurly as our billing partner with a credit system for flexible payment management.

### Subscription management

The **Billing** section includes:

*   **Plan Overview**: Current subscription plan and usage metrics
*   **Payment Management**: Update payment cards and billing addresses
*   **Invoice History**: Past invoices and payment records
*   **Credit Management**: Monitor and manage billing credits

See [How to access and manage billing details](/products/pro/settings/billing/how-to-access-and-manage-my-billing-details/) for more information.

### Credit system

Tallyfy's billing credits work as a pre-paid balance:

*   Credits are used before your payment card is charged
*   You only pay for *active* members (billing begins when they accept their invite or sign in)
*   Removing a member or downgrading mid-cycle returns pro-rated credits for unused time
*   Credits expire after 5 years and are non-refundable
*   You can purchase credits via bank transfer (contact support for details)

:::note[Payment card required]
You must keep a valid payment card on file even if you have credits. This ensures service continues if credits run out.
:::

### Billing notifications

By default, you receive billing emails instantly when changes occur (like adding a new member).

*   **Daily Billing Option**: Contact support to switch to daily billing notifications - one summary email instead of instant updates.

### What happens if my payment fails?

If Tallyfy cannot process your payment:

1. **Immediate notification**: Billing emails alert you with instructions to update your payment method.

2. **Grace period (Days 1-7)**: Your account continues functioning normally. Update your card in **Settings > Billing > Edit Payment Card**.

3. **Read-only mode (Days 7-14)**: You can still log in and view/export all data, but cannot create or launch processes.

4. **Suspension (Days 14-30)**: Access suspended. Contact [support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/) to resolve.

5. **Data deletion (After 30 days)**: Tallyfy reserves the right to delete your data with notice.

:::warning[Act quickly on payment failures]
Update your payment information immediately to avoid service disruption.
:::

### After account deletion

- **90-day backup retention**: Recovery may be possible during this period
- **Permanent deletion**: After 90 days, all data is irreversibly removed

### Account and member limits

Your plan includes limits for:
*   Maximum Full members
*   Maximum Light members
*   File storage space

See [Tallyfy's account and member limits](/products/pro/settings/billing/what-are-tallyfys-account-and-member-limits/) for details.
