## Billing and payment management

The billing section in Tallyfy provides tools to manage all aspects of your subscription, payment methods, and account limits. Tallyfy uses Recurly as its billing system along with a credit system for managing payments and refunds.

### Managing your subscription

Access your billing dashboard to:
- View your current plan details
- Update payment methods
- View past invoices and payment history
- Add or remove user licenses
- Manage your credits

For detailed instructions, see [How to access and manage billing details](/products/pro/settings/billing/how-to-access-and-manage-my-billing-details/).

### Credit system

Tallyfy utilizes a credit system for billing that functions like a bank account balance:

- Credits are used before charging your backup payment card
- You only pay for active members - billing begins when a member activates their account
- Pro-rated credits are applied when you disable members or change roles
- Credits have a 5-year expiration
- Credits can be used for licenses and add-ons, but not professional services
- Credits are not refundable as cash
- Credits are available for purchase via ACH/wire transfer

:::note[Payment Card Requirement]
Even if you add credits to your account via ACH or bank wire transfer, a valid payment card is still required to be on file at all times. This ensures uninterrupted service when your credits are depleted.
:::

When members are disabled or role changes occur:
- **Real-time adjustments**: Billing adjusts immediately when member roles change
- **Pro-rated credits**: When downgrading or disabling members, unused days are credited to your account
- **Credit application**: When upgrading, available credits are applied before charging your card

### Billing notification frequency

By default, Tallyfy sends real-time billing notifications when changes occur that affect your billing, such as when members join or get disabled. If you're receiving too many notifications, you can request a change to your billing notification frequency:

- **Real-time billing** (default): Receive immediate notifications and billing updates whenever changes occur
- **Daily billing**: Updates to billing happen just once a day, consolidating all changes

:::note[Requesting daily billing]
If you prefer to receive fewer billing notifications, you can contact Tallyfy support and request to switch from real-time to daily billing. This is especially helpful for organizations that frequently add or remove members.
:::

### Account and member limits

Each Tallyfy plan includes specific limits on:
- Number of full members allowed
- Number of light members allowed
- Storage allocation for attachments
- Process limits (if applicable)

For a complete breakdown of limits by plan type, see [Tallyfy's account and member limits](/products/pro/settings/billing/what-are-tallyfys-account-and-member-limits/).
