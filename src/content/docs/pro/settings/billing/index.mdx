## How does Tallyfy billing and payment management work?

The **Billing** section within Tallyfy **Settings** lets administrators comprehensively manage subscriptions, payment methods, account limits, and billing oversight.

Tallyfy uses Recurly as our billing partner alongside an innovative credit system that provides flexible payment management and transparent cost control for organizations.

### What subscription management capabilities does Tallyfy provide?

The **Billing** section offers comprehensive subscription management tools that let administrators maintain complete financial oversight:

*   **Plan Overview**: View current subscription plan details and usage metrics
*   **Payment Management**: Update payment card information and billing addresses
*   **Invoice History**: Access past invoices and payment records for accounting purposes
*   **Credit Management**: Monitor and manage billing credits for flexible payment handling

See [How to access and manage billing details](/products/pro/settings/billing/how-to-access-and-manage-my-billing-details/) for more information.

### How does Tallyfy's credit system work?

Tallyfy uses an intelligent billing credit system that works as a pre-paid balance mechanism to simplify subscription management and provide cost predictability:

*   Credits are automatically used before your payment card is charged for any services
*   You only pay for *active* members (billing begins when they accept their invite or sign in)
*   If you remove a member or downgrade their role mid-cycle, you receive pro-rated credits back for the unused time
*   Credits expire after 5 years and are non-refundable as company policy
*   You can purchase credits via bank transfer (contact Tallyfy support for comprehensive details)

:::note[Payment card required]
You must keep a valid payment card on file even if you have credits. This ensures service continues if credits run out.
:::

### How does billing notification frequency work?

By default, you receive billing emails instantly when changes occur (like adding a new member). To receive fewer email notifications:

*   **Daily Billing Option**: Contact Tallyfy Support to request daily billing notifications. You'll receive one comprehensive daily summary email instead of instant updates.

### What are account and member limits?

Your Tallyfy plan includes specific limits, such as:
*   Maximum number of Full members allowed
*   Maximum number of Light members permitted
*   Available file storage space allocation

See [Tallyfy's account and member limits](/products/pro/settings/billing/what-are-tallyfys-account-and-member-limits/) for comprehensive details.
