## Billing and payment management

The **Billing** section in Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> **Settings** is where administrators manage the subscription, payment methods, and view limits. Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> uses a billing partner (Recurly) and a credit system.

### Managing your subscription

In the **Billing** section, you can:
*   See your current plan.
*   Update your payment card.
*   View past invoices.
*   Manage billing credits.

See [How to access and manage billing details](/products/pro/settings/billing/how-to-access-and-manage-my-billing-details/) for more information.

### Understanding the credit system

Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> uses billing credits, like a pre-paid balance:

*   Credits are used automatically before your payment card is charged.
*   You only pay for *active* members (billing starts when they accept their invite or sign in).
*   If you remove a member or downgrade their role mid-cycle, you get pro-rated credits back for the unused time.
*   Credits expire after 5 years and are non-refundable.
*   You can buy credits via bank transfer (contact Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> for details).

:::note[Payment card required]
You must keep a valid payment card on file even if you have credits. This ensures service continues if credits run out.
:::

### Billing notification frequency

By default, you get billing emails instantly when changes occur (like adding a member). To receive fewer emails:

*   **Daily Billing Option**: Contact Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> Support to request daily billing. You'll get one daily summary email instead of instant updates.

### Account and member limits

Your Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> plan has limits, such as:
*   Number of Full members.
*   Number of Light members.
*   File storage space.

See [Tallyfy's account and member limits](/products/pro/settings/billing/what-are-tallyfys-account-and-member-limits/) for details.
