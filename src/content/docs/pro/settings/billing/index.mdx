## Billing overview

Go to **Settings > Billing** to manage your subscription, payment methods, and invoices. Tallyfy uses Recurly as its billing partner with a credit-based system.

The Billing section covers:

*   **Plan overview** - current plan and usage
*   **Payment management** - update cards and billing addresses
*   **Invoice history** - past invoices and payment records
*   **Credit management** - monitor and manage billing credits

See [How to access and manage billing details](/products/pro/settings/billing/how-to-access-and-manage-my-billing-details/) for step-by-step instructions.

### Credit system

Tallyfy billing credits work as a pre-paid balance:

*   Credits are used before your payment card is charged
*   You only pay for *active* members - billing starts when they accept their invite or sign in
*   Removing a member or downgrading mid-cycle returns pro-rated credits for unused time
*   Credits expire after 5 years and aren't refundable
*   You can buy credits via bank transfer (contact support for details)

:::note[Payment card required]
You must keep a valid payment card on file even if you have credits. This keeps your service running if credits run out.
:::

### Billing notifications

By default, you'll get billing emails instantly when changes happen (like adding a new member). Contact support to switch to daily billing notifications - one summary email instead of instant updates.

### What happens if my payment fails?

If Tallyfy can't process your payment:

1. **Immediate notification** - billing emails alert you with instructions to update your payment method.

2. **Grace period (Days 1-7)** - your account keeps working normally. Update your card in **Settings > Billing > Edit Payment Card**.

3. **Read-only mode (Days 7-14)** - you can still log in and view/export all data, but can't create or launch processes.

4. **Suspension (Days 14-30)** - access suspended. Contact [support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/) to resolve.

5. **Data deletion (After 30 days)** - Tallyfy reserves the right to delete your data with notice.

:::warning[Act quickly on payment failures]
Update your payment information right away to avoid service disruption.
:::

### After account deletion

- **90-day backup retention** - recovery may be possible during this period
- **Permanent deletion** - after 90 days, all data is irreversibly removed

### Account and member limits

Your plan sets limits for:
*   Maximum Full members
*   Maximum Light members
*   File storage space

See [Tallyfy's account and member limits](/products/pro/settings/billing/what-are-tallyfys-account-and-member-limits/) for details.
