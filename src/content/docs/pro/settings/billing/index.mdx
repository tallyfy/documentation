## Billing and payment management

The billing section in Tallyfy provides tools to manage all aspects of your subscription, payment methods, and account limits. This section covers:

### Managing your subscription

Access your billing dashboard to:
- View your current plan details
- Update payment methods
- Change billing cycles (monthly/annual)
- View past invoices and payment history
- Add or remove user licenses

For detailed instructions, see [How to access and manage billing details](/products/pro/settings/billing/how-to-access-and-manage-my-billing-details/).

### Account and member limits

Each Tallyfy plan includes specific limits on:
- Number of full members allowed
- Number of light members allowed
- Storage allocation for attachments
- Process limits (if applicable)

For a complete breakdown of limits by plan type, see [Tallyfy's account and member limits](/products/pro/settings/billing/what-are-tallyfys-account-and-member-limits/).

### Special pricing programs

To redeem a coupon code:
