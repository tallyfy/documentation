## Billing and payment management

The **Billing** section in Tallyfy **Settings** is where administrators manage the subscription, payment methods, and view limits. Tallyfy uses a billing partner (Recurly) and a credit system.

### Managing your subscription

In the **Billing** section, you can:
*   See your current plan.
*   Update your payment card.
*   View past invoices.
*   Manage billing credits.

See [How to access and manage billing details](/products/pro/settings/billing/how-to-access-and-manage-my-billing-details/) for more information.

### Understanding the credit system

Tallyfy uses billing credits, like a pre-paid balance:

*   Credits are used automatically before your payment card is charged.
*   You only pay for *active* members (billing starts when they accept their invite or sign in).
*   If you remove a member or downgrade their role mid-cycle, you get pro-rated credits back for the unused time.
*   Credits expire after 5 years and are non-refundable.
*   You can buy credits via bank transfer (contact Tallyfy for details).

:::note[Payment card required]
You must keep a valid payment card on file even if you have credits. This ensures service continues if credits run out.

### Billing notification frequency

By default, you get billing emails instantly when changes occur (like adding a member). To receive fewer emails:

*   **Daily Billing Option**: Contact Tallyfy Support to request daily billing. You'll get one daily summary email instead of instant updates.

### Account and member limits

Your Tallyfy plan has limits, such as:
*   Number of Full members.
*   Number of Light members.
*   File storage space.

See [Tallyfy's account and member limits](/products/pro/settings/billing/what-are-tallyfys-account-and-member-limits/) for details.

### Special pricing programs

#### Using coupon codes

If you have a valid discount coupon code:
<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings > Billing**.
2. Click **Update Plan** (or a similar subscription button).
3. Enter the code in the "Have a coupon?" field during checkout.
</Steps>

#### Fair price guarantee program

Tallyfy offers large discounts for organizations in eligible countries.

To be eligible:
*   Most of your users must be located in an eligible country.
*   You must be on an annual plan.

To apply:
<Steps>
1. Check the [Fair Price Guarantee page](https://tallyfy.com/pricing/fair-price-guarantee/) for eligibility rules and instructions.
2. Submit the application form from that page.
3. If approved, you will receive a coupon code to use.
</Steps>

:::note[Payment method]
Your payment method must be from a bank in the eligible country to qualify for the Fair Price Guarantee discount.
