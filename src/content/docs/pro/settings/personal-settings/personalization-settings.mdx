## Manage your personal and profile settings

Tallyfy allows you to customize the way most of the information is displayed to you. To access this feature follow these steps:

<Steps>
1. Click on **Settings** in the sidebar.
2. Go to **My account**.
</Steps>

## Personalization settings

On the Personalization section, you can customize the following:

- **UI Language**: Choose the language in which you want Tallyfy's interface to be displayed. This changes buttons, menus, and system text, but does not translate user-generated content. For content translation, see the [Azure Translation Services](/products/pro/integrations/azure-translation/) integration.
- **Time zone**: Set your time zone to ensure that all dates and times are displayed correctly.
- **Date format**: Choose the format in which you want dates to be displayed.
- **Set how dates show up to you**: Choose how you want dates to be displayed in Tallyfy. You can choose between **Relative** (e.g., "Today", "Tomorrow", "Yesterday") or **Hard Dates** (e.g., "2021-12-31").
- **Sounds**: Enable or disable sounds when completing and re-opening a task.
