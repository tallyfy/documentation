## Managing your personal and profile settings

You can customize parts of your Tallyfy<sup>Â®</sup> setup to suit your preferences. To find these settings:

<Steps>
1. Click **Settings** (usually at the bottom left).
2. Go to **My Account**.
</Steps>

There are several tabs here:

### Personalization settings

This tab lets you change how Tallyfy shows information to you:

*   **UI Language**: Choose the display language for Tallyfy menus and buttons (this does not translate task or template content).
*   **Time zone**: Set your local time zone so deadlines and timestamps appear correctly for you.
*   **Date format**: Choose your preferred date format (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY or DD/MM/YYYY).
*   **Date display**: Choose whether dates appear as **Relative** (e.g., "Tomorrow", "In 2 days") or **Hard Dates** (e.g., "2023-10-27").
*   **Sounds**: Turn task completion sounds on or off.
