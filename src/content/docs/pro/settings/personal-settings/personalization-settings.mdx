## How can I manage my personal and profile settings?

You can customize various aspects of your Tallyfy<sup>Â®</sup> experience to suit your individual preferences. To access these settings:

<Steps>
1. Click **Settings** (typically located at the bottom left).
2. Navigate to **My Account**.
</Steps>

You'll find several important tabs available here:

### How do personalization settings work?

This tab allows you to customize how Tallyfy displays information specifically for you:

*   **UI Language**: Select the display language for Tallyfy menus and buttons (this does not translate task or template content)
*   **Time zone**: Configure your local time zone so deadlines and timestamps appear correctly for your location
*   **Date format**: Choose your preferred date format (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY or DD/MM/YYYY)
*   **Date display**: Choose whether dates appear as **Relative** (e.g., "Tomorrow", "In 2 days") or **Hard Dates** (e.g., "2023-10-27")
*   **Sounds**: Enable or disable task completion sounds for audio feedback
