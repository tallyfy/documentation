## Managing Your Personal and Profile Settings

You can customize parts of your Tallyfy experience to match your preferences. To find these settings:

<Steps>
1. Click **Settings** (usually bottom left).
2. Go to **My Account**.
</Steps>

There are several tabs here:

### Personalization Settings

This tab lets you change how Tallyfy *displays* information *to you*:

*   **UI Language**: Choose the language for Tallyfy's menus and buttons (does not translate task content).
*   **Time zone**: Set your local time zone so deadlines and timestamps show correctly for you.
*   **Date format**: Choose how you like dates written (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY or DD/MM/YYYY).
*   **Date display**: Choose if you prefer seeing dates as **Relative** (like "Tomorrow", "In 2 days") or **Hard Dates** (like "2023-10-27").
*   **Sounds**: Turn notification sounds on or off for completing tasks.
