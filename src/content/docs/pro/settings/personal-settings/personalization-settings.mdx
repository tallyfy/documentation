## Managing personal and profile settings

Your personal Tallyfy settings live under **Settings** > **My Account**. Two tabs are available here.

<Steps>
1. Click **Settings** (bottom left).
2. Go to **My Account**.
</Steps>

### Personalization settings

Control how Tallyfy displays information for you:

*   **UI Language** - pick the display language for menus and buttons (this won't translate task or template content)
*   **Time zone** - set your local time zone so deadlines and timestamps show correctly
*   **Date format** - choose your preferred format (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY or DD/MM/YYYY)
*   **Date display** - toggle between **Relative** dates (e.g., "Tomorrow", "In 2 days") and **Hard Dates** (e.g., "2023-10-27")
*   **Sounds** - turn task completion sounds on or off
