## Uploading or changing your profile picture

Your profile picture appears next to tasks you're assigned to and in system emails. It helps teammates recognize you at a glance.

Here's how to add or change your photo:

<Steps>
1. Click **Settings** (bottom left of the screen).
2. Go to **My Account** > **Profile**.
3. Click the **CHANGE PHOTO** button.

4. Pick an image file from your computer. Accepted formats are JPG, PNG, and GIF - max 2 MB.
5. Crop the image in the popup that appears, then confirm. Your photo uploads automatically.
</Steps>

Your new photo appears across Tallyfy right away - no need to click **SAVE CHANGES** separately for the photo.
