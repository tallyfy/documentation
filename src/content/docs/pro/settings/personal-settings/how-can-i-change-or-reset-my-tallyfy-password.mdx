## Changing or resetting your Tallyfy password

There are two primary methods to update your Tallyfy password:

1.  **Change it while logged in** (if you know your current password)
2.  **Reset it if you forgot it** (if you cannot log in to your account)

### Changing password while logged in

<Steps>
1. Click your profile picture or name located in the top right corner.
2. Choose **Settings** from the dropdown menu.
3. Select **My Profile** from the left navigation menu.
4. Click the **Security** tab.
5. Enter your **Current Password** in the appropriate field.
6. Enter your desired **New Password**.
7. Re-enter the **New Password** in the **Confirm Password** field.
8. Click **Save Changes** to update your password.
</Steps>

### Resetting a forgotten password

If you cannot log in because you forgot your password:

<Steps>
1. Navigate to the Tallyfy sign-in page: [https://go.tallyfy.com/#/sign-in](https://go.tallyfy.com/#/sign-in)
2. Click the **Forgot password?** link located below the password field.
3. Enter the email address associated with your Tallyfy account.
4. Click **Send Reset Link** to initiate the process.
5. Check your email inbox for a message from Tallyfy containing a password reset link.
6. If you don't see it after a few minutes, check your spam or junk folder thoroughly.
7. **Important:** The reset link in the email expires after 24 hours.
8. Click the password reset link in the email.
9. A secure page will open where you can enter and confirm your **New Password**.
10. Enter the same new password again to confirm it matches.
11. Click **Reset Password** to finalize the change.
12. You can now log in using your email address and the new password.
</Steps>

### Password requirements

For enhanced security, your Tallyfy password must:
- Contain at least 8 characters in total
- Include at least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
- Include at least one lowercase letter (a-z)
- Include at least one number (0-9)
- Be different from your previous password

:::note[Limits on password changes]
For security reasons, you can only change or reset your password 3 times per day. If you need assistance beyond this limit, please contact support.
:::

### Troubleshooting password reset

- Ensure you enter the correct email address associated with your Tallyfy account
- Verify if the reset link has expired (it remains valid for 24 hours)
- If you don't receive the reset email (after checking spam folders), [contact Tallyfy Support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/). Please provide your name, company name, and the email address you believe is linked to the account

### Fixing authentication loops

If you experience loops where password reset redirects you to create a new account or keeps asking for credentials repeatedly, your browser session needs to be completely cleared.

**Quick solution**: Visit [https://account.tallyfy.com/logout](https://account.tallyfy.com/logout) to force a complete logout, then:

<Steps>
1. Go directly to the logout URL: [https://account.tallyfy.com/logout](https://account.tallyfy.com/logout)
2. Clear your browser cookies for all tallyfy.com domains
3. Close all Tallyfy browser tabs completely
4. Wait 10-15 seconds for session cleanup
5. Navigate directly to: [https://account.tallyfy.com/password/reset](https://account.tallyfy.com/password/reset)
6. Enter your email and request the reset link
7. Check your email and click the reset link to set your new password
</Steps>

:::tip[Why this happens]
Authentication loops during password reset typically occur when:
- Your account type (especially Light members) isn't properly recognized
- Browser sessions from previous login attempts conflict with the reset process
- Cookies from multiple organizations cause session confusion
The logout URL clears all these conflicting sessions at once.
