## Change or reset your Tallyfy password

You can update your password two ways - change it while logged in, or reset it if you've forgotten it.

### Change password while logged in

<Steps>
1. Click your profile picture or name in the top right corner.
2. Select **Settings** from the dropdown menu.
3. Go to **My Profile** in the left navigation.
4. Click the **Security** tab.
5. Enter your **Current Password**.
6. Enter your **New Password**.
7. Re-enter it in the **Confirm Password** field.
8. Click **Save Changes**.
</Steps>

### Reset a forgotten password

<Steps>
1. Go to the Tallyfy sign-in page: [https://go.tallyfy.com/#/sign-in](https://go.tallyfy.com/#/sign-in)
2. Click the **Forgot password?** link below the password field.
3. Enter your Tallyfy account email address.
4. Click **Send Reset Link**.
5. Check your inbox for a password reset email from Tallyfy.
6. If you don't see it after a few minutes, check your spam or junk folder.
7. **Important:** The reset link expires after 60 minutes.
8. Click the reset link in the email.
9. Enter and confirm your **New Password** on the page that opens.
10. Click **Reset Password** to finish.
</Steps>

### Password requirements

Your Tallyfy password must:
- Be at least 6 characters long
- Include at least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
- Include at least one lowercase letter (a-z)
- Include at least one number (0-9)

Maximum length is 127 characters.

### Troubleshooting password reset

- Double-check you're entering the correct email for your Tallyfy account
- Reset links expire after 60 minutes - request a new one if yours has expired
- If you don't receive the email (after checking spam), [contact Tallyfy Support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/) with your name, company name, and the email address linked to your account

### Fixing authentication loops

If password reset keeps redirecting you to create a new account or asking for credentials repeatedly, visit [https://account.tallyfy.com/logout](https://account.tallyfy.com/logout) to force a complete logout. Then follow these steps:

<Steps>
1. Go to: [https://account.tallyfy.com/logout](https://account.tallyfy.com/logout)
2. Clear your browser cookies for all tallyfy.com domains.
3. Close all Tallyfy browser tabs.
4. Wait 10-15 seconds for session cleanup.
5. Go to: [https://account.tallyfy.com/password/reset](https://account.tallyfy.com/password/reset)
6. Enter your email and request the reset link.
7. Check your email and click the reset link to set your new password.
</Steps>

:::tip[Why this happens]
Authentication loops during password reset typically happen when:
- Your account type (especially Light members) isn't properly recognized
- Browser sessions from previous login attempts conflict with the reset process
- Cookies from multiple organizations cause session confusion
