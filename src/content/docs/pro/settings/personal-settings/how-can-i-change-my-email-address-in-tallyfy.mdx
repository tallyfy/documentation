## How can I update my login email address in Tallyfy?

Your email address serves as your Tallyfy login credential. This comprehensive guide explains how to safely change your email address.

:::note[Special process for SSO and social signup users]
If you originally signed up or sign in using [Single Sign-On (SSO)](/products/pro/integrations/authentication/) or social login (Google, Microsoft), you cannot change your email address directly. This is because these users authenticate through external providers and don't have passwords in Tallyfy. You'll need to follow the [member transition process](#sso-and-social-login-users) outlined at the bottom of this article.
:::

### What are the prerequisites for changing my email address?

*   You must be logged in to your Tallyfy account using your current email address
*   You need access to *both* your current and new email inboxes for verification purposes
*   You must have signed up with a regular email and password (not SSO or social login)

### What are the steps to update my email address?

<Steps>
1. Click your profile picture or name located in the top right corner.
2. Choose **Settings** from the dropdown menu that appears.
3. In the **Settings** menu (on the left side), select **My Profile**.
4. Ensure you are on the **My Details** tab.
5. Locate the **Email** field and enter your new email address.
6. Scroll down and click **Save Changes** to confirm.
7. You should see a confirmation message indicating the change was successful.
</Steps>

### How do I verify and use my new email address?

<Steps>
1. Log out of Tallyfy completely.
2. Log back in using your **new** email address and your current Tallyfy password.
3. Check your **new** email inbox for any verification emails from Tallyfy, although this verification step isn't always required.
</Steps>

:::note[Limits on email changes]
For security reasons, you can only change your email address 3 times per day on free plans. Paid plans don't have this restriction. Contact support if you need to exceed this limit.
:::

### What should I do if I encounter problems?

*   Double-check that you typed the new email address correctly without any typos
*   Confirm you can receive emails at the new address (check spam folders thoroughly)
*   If you cannot log in after changing the email, [contact Tallyfy Support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/) and provide both your old and new email addresses for assistance

## SSO and social login users

If you signed up or sign in using [Single Sign-On (SSO)](/products/pro/integrations/authentication/) or social login (Google, Microsoft), changing your email address requires a different approach. You cannot update the email address directly because these users authenticate through external providers and don't have passwords in Tallyfy to verify their identity.

### How to change email for SSO/social login accounts

<Steps>
1. **[Invite the new email address as a member](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-to-invite-and-activate-members-on-tallyfy/)** to your Tallyfy organization.
2. **Wait for activation**: The person with the new email address must accept the invitation or join via SSO with their new credentials.
3. **[Deactivate the old member account](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-can-i-remove-a-member-from-my-tallyfy-organization/)**: Once the new member is active, deactivate the account with the old email address.
4. **Transfer tasks using conflict resolution**: When deactivating the old member, Tallyfy will prompt you to reassign their tasks and template assignments to the new member account.
</Steps>

This process ensures all your tasks, permissions, and workflow assignments transfer properly from the old email address to the new one while maintaining the security of your SSO or social login authentication.

### Why this process is necessary

SSO and social login accounts authenticate through external identity providers (like Google, Microsoft, or your company's SSO system) and don't have passwords stored in Tallyfy. Since email changes require password verification for security, these users cannot use the direct email change feature. The member transition process ensures proper task inheritance while working around this technical limitation.
