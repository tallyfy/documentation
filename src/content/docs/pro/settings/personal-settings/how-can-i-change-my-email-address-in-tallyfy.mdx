## Updating your login email

Change your email by going to **Settings** > **My Account** > **My Profile**, editing the **Email** field, and saving. You'll need to confirm with your current password.

:::note[Special process for SSO and social signup users]
If you signed up via [Single Sign-On (SSO)](/products/pro/integrations/authentication/) or social login (Google, Microsoft), you can't change your email directly. These accounts don't have passwords in Tallyfy, so you'll need to follow the [member transition process](#sso-and-social-login-users) below.
:::

### Prerequisites

*   You're logged in to Tallyfy with your current email
*   You have access to *both* your current and new email inboxes
*   You signed up with a regular email and password (not SSO or social login)

### Steps to update your email

<Steps>
1. Click your profile picture in the top right corner.
2. Select **Settings** from the dropdown.
3. Go to **My Account** > **My Profile** in the left sidebar.
4. Find the **Email** field and enter your new email address.
5. Click **Save Changes**.
6. A password confirmation dialog will appear - enter your current password and click **Continue**.
</Steps>

### Using your new email

<Steps>
1. Log out of Tallyfy.
2. Log back in with your **new** email address and your existing password.
</Steps>

:::note[Limits on email changes]
Free plans are limited to 3 email changes per day. Paid plans don't have this restriction.
:::

### Troubleshooting

*   Double-check for typos in the new email address
*   Make sure you can receive emails at the new address (check spam folders)
*   If you can't log in after the change, [contact Tallyfy Support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/) with both your old and new email addresses

## SSO and social login users

If you use [SSO](/products/pro/integrations/authentication/) or social login (Google, Microsoft), you can't edit your email directly. The email change process requires password verification, and SSO/social accounts don't have passwords stored in Tallyfy.

Instead, use a member transition.

### Changing email for SSO/social login accounts

<Steps>
1. **[Invite the new email as a member](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-to-invite-and-activate-members-on-tallyfy/)** to your Tallyfy organization.
2. **Wait for activation** - the new email must accept the invitation or join via SSO.
3. **[Deactivate the old account](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-can-i-remove-a-member-from-my-tallyfy-organization/)** once the new member is active.
4. **Transfer tasks via conflict resolution** - Tallyfy will prompt you to reassign tasks and template assignments to the new account when deactivating the old one.
</Steps>
