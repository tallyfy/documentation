## How to switch between organizations

Tallyfy allows users to manage multiple organizations through the Organization Switcher feature.

To access the Organization Switcher, click on your profile picture on the sidebar, and then, select **Switch Organizations**. There, you will find a list of all the organizations that you are a member or a guest of. Simply click on the organization name that you want to work with.
