## How to switch between organizations

If your Tallyfy login (email address) is part of multiple Tallyfy organizations (e.g., your company and a client account), you can easily switch between them.

<Steps>
1. Click your profile picture or name (top right).
2. Select **Switch Organizations** from the dropdown menu.
3. A list appears showing all organizations you belong to (as a [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) or [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/)).
4. Click the name of the organization you want to switch to.

</Steps>

This allows you to work across different accounts using just one Tallyfy login.
