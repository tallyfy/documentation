## How to use the Organization Switcher

Tallyfy allows users to manage multiple organizations through the Organization Switcher feature.

To access the Organization Switcher, click on your profile picture on the sidebar, and then, select **Switch Organizations**. There, you will find a list of all the organizations that you are a [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) or a [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) of. Simply click on the organization name that you want to work with.

This makes it convenient for those who work for or manage multiple companies to easily navigate between different company accounts in Tallyfy.
