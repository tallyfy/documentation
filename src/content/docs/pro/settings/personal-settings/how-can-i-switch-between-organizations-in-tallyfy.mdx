## How can I switch between organizations in Tallyfy?

If your Tallyfy login (email address) is associated with multiple Tallyfy organizations (e.g., your company and a client account), you can seamlessly switch between them.

<Steps>
1. Click your profile picture or name located in the top right corner.
2. Select **Switch Organizations** from the dropdown menu that appears.
3. A comprehensive list displays showing all organizations you belong to (as a [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) or [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/)).
4. Click the name of the specific organization you want to switch to.

</Steps>

This powerful feature allows you to work efficiently across different accounts using just one Tallyfy login credential.
