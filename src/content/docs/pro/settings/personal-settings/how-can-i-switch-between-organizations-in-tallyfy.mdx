## Switching between organizations

If your Tallyfy login email is tied to more than one organization (e.g., your company and a client's account), you can switch between them without logging out. The **Switch Organization** option only appears when you belong to two or more organizations.

<Steps>
1. Click your profile picture in the top-right corner.
2. Select **Switch Organization** from the dropdown menu.
3. You'll see all organizations where you're a [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) or [guest](/products/pro/documenting/guests/).
4. Click the organization you want to switch to.

</Steps>

One login handles all your organizations - no need for separate credentials.
