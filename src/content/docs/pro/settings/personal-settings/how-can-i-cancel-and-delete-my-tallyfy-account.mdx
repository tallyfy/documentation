</Steps>

:::warning[Deletion is permanent and irreversible!]
*   Once your account is deleted, all your data, processes, templates, and user information will be **permanently deleted**. It cannot be restored.
*   You **must** submit the official closure form using the link above. Informal requests (like emails to support asking for deletion) will not be processed due to privacy and security policies.
:::

After you submit the official closure form, a Tallyfy team member will process the request and confirm when the deletion is done. All billing for the account will also stop.
