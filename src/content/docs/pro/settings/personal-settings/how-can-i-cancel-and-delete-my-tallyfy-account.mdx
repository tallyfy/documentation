## How do I permanently delete my Tallyfy account?

To cancel and delete your Tallyfy account, follow these simple steps:

1. Sign in to your account and click on "Settings".
2. Go to the "Billing" tab.
3. Click on "DELETE ACCOUNT".
4. Fill out and submit the closure form at [https://tallyfy.wufoo.com/forms/x1ppn8y00lni9lx/](https://tallyfy.wufoo.com/forms/x1ppn8y00lni9lx/), making sure to enter the correct Organization ID for the account you want to close.

:::warning[Permanent deletion - no going back]
Account deletion is permanent and irreversible. There is no way to recover your account, [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/), or data after deletion is complete. 

Please note that informal requests to delete an account will not be honored. All customers or trial users must complete the official closure form linked above. This formal process is required for privacy and [compliance](/products/pro/compliance/) reasons, ensuring proper data deletion and documentation.
:::

Once you've submitted the closure form, a [Tallyfy Support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/) team member will confirm when your account has been permanently deleted. This will also stop all billing associated with your account.
