:::warning[Deletion is permanent and irreversible!]
*   Once your account is deleted, all your organizational data, processes, templates, and user information will be **permanently and irreversibly deleted**. No data can be restored after deletion.
*   You **must** submit the official closure form using the specific link provided above. Informal requests (like emails to support requesting deletion) will not be processed due to strict privacy and security policies.
:::

After you submit the official closure form, a Tallyfy team member will review and process your request, then confirm when the deletion has been completed. All billing for the account will also be permanently stopped.
