To cancel and delete your Tallyfy account, follow these simple steps:

1. Sign in to your account and click on "Settings".
2. Go to the "Billing" tab.
3. Click on "DELETE ACCOUNT".
4. Fill out and submit the closure form at [https://tallyfy.wufoo.com/forms/x1ppn8y00lni9lx/](https://tallyfy.wufoo.com/forms/x1ppn8y00lni9lx/), making sure to enter the correct Organization ID for the account you want to close.

Once you've submitted the closure form, a Tallyfy Support team member will confirm when your account has been permanently deleted. This will also stop all billing associated with your account.
