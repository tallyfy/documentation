:::warning[Deletion is permanent and irreversible!]
*   Once your account is deleted, all your organizational data, processes, templates, and user information will be **permanently and irreversibly deleted**. No data can be restored after deletion.
*   You **must** submit the official closure form using the specific link provided above. Informal requests (like emails to support requesting deletion) will not be processed due to strict privacy and security policies.

After you submit the official closure form, a Tallyfy team member will review and process your request, then confirm when the deletion has been completed. All billing for the account will also be permanently stopped.
