## Permanently deleting your Tallyfy account

Only an Administrator can delete a Tallyfy organization. This action is **irreversible** - all data is permanently removed.

<Steps>
1. Log in to Tallyfy as an Administrator for the organization you want to delete.
2. Go to **Settings** > **Billing**.
3. Click the **DELETE ACCOUNT** button.
4. You'll be taken to an official account closure form. Complete and submit it.
5. Make sure the correct [Organization ID](/products/pro/miscellaneous/how-to-find-your-tallyfy-ids/) is on the form for the account you want to close.

</Steps>

:::warning[Deletion is permanent and irreversible!]
*   Once deleted, all organizational data, processes, templates, and user information are **permanently removed**. Nothing can be restored.
*   You **must** use the official closure form. Informal requests like support emails won't be processed due to privacy and security policies.
:::

### Data retention after deletion

- **30-day export window** - export any data you need before final deletion
- **90-day backup retention** - recovery may be possible via [support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/)
- **Permanent deletion** - after 90 days, all data is irreversibly removed

:::note[Non-payment closures]
The same 30-day/90-day timeline applies to accounts closed due to non-payment.
:::

After you submit the form, a Tallyfy team member will review your request and confirm when deletion is complete. All billing stops permanently at that point.
