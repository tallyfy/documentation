## Permanently deleting your Tallyfy account

If you need to permanently close and delete your Tallyfy organization, follow these detailed steps carefully. **Please note this action is completely irreversible and cannot be undone.**

<Steps>
1. Log in to Tallyfy as an Administrator for the specific organization you want to delete.
2. Click **Settings** in the navigation.
3. Navigate to the **Billing** section.
4. Locate and click the button labeled **DELETE ACCOUNT**.
5. You will need to complete an official account closure form at [tallyfy.com/account-closure-request-form](https://tallyfy.com/account-closure-request-form/).
6. **Critical:** Ensure you enter the correct [Organization ID](/products/pro/miscellaneous/how-to-find-your-tallyfy-ids/) on the form for the specific account you want to permanently close.
7. Submit the completed closure form.

</Steps>

:::warning[Deletion is permanent and irreversible!]
*   Once your account is deleted, all your organizational data, processes, templates, and user information will be **permanently and irreversibly deleted**. No data can be restored after deletion.
*   You **must** submit the official closure form using the specific link provided above. Informal requests (like emails to support requesting deletion) will not be processed due to strict privacy and security policies.
:::

### Data retention after deletion

- **30-day export window**: Ensure you export needed data before final deletion
- **90-day backup retention**: Recovery may be possible via [support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/)
- **Permanent deletion**: After 90 days, all data is irreversibly removed

:::note[Non-payment closures]
The same 30-day/90-day timeline applies to accounts closed due to non-payment.
:::

After you submit the official closure form, a Tallyfy team member will review and process your request, then confirm when the deletion has been completed. All billing for the account will also be permanently stopped.
