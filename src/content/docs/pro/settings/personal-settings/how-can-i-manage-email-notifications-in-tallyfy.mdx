## How to customize your email notification settings

This article explains how to manage email notifications in Tallyfy.

To access the email notification settings, go to your profile settings > email notifications.

Here, you have control over which email notifications you receive. If you want to unsubscribe from any type of email, set it to **No**.

To stop receiving email alerts about completed tasks, toggle the corresponding setting off.

### Email reminder settings

Important notes about email reminders in Tallyfy:

- All members and guests automatically receive email reminders for incomplete or upcoming tasks
- If a team member isn't receiving reminders, first check if they've adjusted their own notification settings
- While you can customize reminder frequency, you cannot turn them off completely - the minimum setting is one day per week
- You can select which specific days of the week you want to receive your task digest by using the day selectors

If you need to send an immediate reminder outside of the scheduled digests, you can [manually send email reminders](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-can-i-send-email-reminders-in-tallyfy/) to task assignees at any time.
