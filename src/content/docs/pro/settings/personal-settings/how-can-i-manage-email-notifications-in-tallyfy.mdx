## How can I manage email notifications in Tallyfy?

Tallyfy provides comprehensive email notification customization enabling precise control over communication frequency and notification types.

These personalized notification settings ensure you receive relevant workflow updates while preventing email overload through selective notification management and customizable reminder summary scheduling.

To change your settings:
1. Click your profile picture/name (top right) > **Settings**.
2. Go to **My Profile** > **Email Notifications** tab.

Here you can turn different notification types ON or OFF using the toggles. For example, if you don't want an email every time a task you assigned is completed, turn that notification OFF.

### Email reminder settings (digest emails)

Tallyfy<sup>Â®</sup> automatically sends email digests reminding you and guests about tasks that are due soon or overdue.

*   **Frequency**: In your Email Notification settings, you can choose which days of the week you want to receive this reminder digest email.
*   **Cannot turn off completely**: For important task tracking, you cannot completely turn off these reminder emails. You must choose at least one day per week to receive the digest.
*   **Check individual settings**: If someone says they aren't getting reminders, ask them to check their settings on this page first.

Remember, even if someone has reduced their automatic reminders, you can always [manually send an instant reminder](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-can-i-send-email-reminders-in-tallyfy/) for a specific task.

:::note[Future Possibility: Interactive Emails]
In the future, Tallyfy is [exploring interactive email actions](/products/pro/integrations/interactive-email-actions/) that could allow you to complete certain quick tasks directly from within some email clients, potentially making these notifications even more actionable.
