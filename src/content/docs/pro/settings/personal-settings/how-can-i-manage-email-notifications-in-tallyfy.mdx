## Managing email notifications

You can control exactly which emails Tallyfy sends you - from task assignments to comment alerts to process completions.

To change your settings:
1. Click your profile picture/name (top right) > **Settings**.
2. Go to **My Profile** > **Email Notifications** tab.

Toggle each notification type ON or OFF. For example, if you don't want an email every time someone completes a task you assigned, turn that notification OFF.

The available notification types include:
- **Task assignments** - emails about tasks where you're assigned
- **Other people's task updates** - when others complete or update tasks
- **Comments** - comments on tasks where you're assigned
- **@mentions** - when someone @mentions you in a comment
- **Process completed** - when a process you're part of finishes
- **Deadline changes** - when task deadlines are changed

:::important[Process initiators and task notifications]
**When you start a process where you're also assigned tasks**, you typically won't get immediate email notifications for those tasks. This prevents email spam when launching processes.

**Why this happens**:
- Tallyfy assumes you're aware of tasks you just created by launching the process
- Prevents duplicate notifications (one for launching, one for each task)
- You'll still see tasks in your dashboard right away

**To make sure you get reminders**:
- Turn on daily digest emails in your settings
- Set deadlines on tasks
- Other assignees will get immediate notifications as normal

**Special case - Zapier-initiated processes**: If a process is started via Zapier with you as the process starter, you won't get task notifications either. Workaround: have Zapier assign a different user as the process starter, or use webhooks for external notifications.

### Digest emails (reminder settings)

Tallyfy sends digest emails at 6 AM in your local timezone, summarizing tasks that are due soon or overdue.

*   **Choose your days**: Pick which days of the week you want to receive the digest. The default is Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.
*   **Turn it on or off**: You can toggle the daily digest preference on or off in your notification settings.
*   **Troubleshooting**: If someone says they aren't getting reminders, have them check their notification settings first.

Even if someone has reduced their automatic reminders, you can always [manually send an instant reminder](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-can-i-send-email-reminders-in-tallyfy/) for a specific task.
