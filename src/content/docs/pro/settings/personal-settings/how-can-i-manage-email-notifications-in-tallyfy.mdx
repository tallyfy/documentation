## How to customize your email notification settings

You can control which emails Tallyfy sends and how often you get reminder summary emails.

To change your settings:
1. Click your profile picture/name (top right) > **Settings**.
2. Go to **My Profile** > **Email Notifications** tab.

Here you can turn different notification types ON or OFF using the toggles. For example, if you don't want an email every time a task you assigned is completed, turn that notification OFF.

### Email reminder settings (digest emails)

Tallyfy automatically sends email digests reminding you and guests about tasks that are due soon or overdue.

*   **Frequency**: In your Email Notification settings, you can choose which days of the week you want to receive this reminder digest email.
*   **Cannot turn off completely**: For important task tracking, you cannot completely turn off these reminder emails. You must choose at least one day per week to receive the digest.
*   **Check individual settings**: If someone says they aren't getting reminders, ask them to check their settings on this page first.

Remember, even if someone has reduced their automatic reminders, you can always [manually send an instant reminder](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/how-can-i-send-email-reminders-in-tallyfy/) for a specific task.

:::note[Future Possibility: Interactive Emails]
In the future, Tallyfy is [exploring interactive email actions](/products/pro/integrations/interactive-email-actions/) that could allow you to complete certain quick tasks directly from within some email clients, potentially making these notifications even more actionable.
