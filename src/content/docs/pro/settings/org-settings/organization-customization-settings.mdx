## Customizing your organization's settings

This section covers settings found under **Settings > Organization > Customization**. Administrators use these settings to change how Tallyfy works for everyone in the organization.

:::note[Admin only]
Only users with the Administrator role can access and change these settings.
:::

### Member permissions settings

*   **Allow non-Admins to invite members?**: If **Yes**, Standard members can also invite other members (as Standard or Light roles only). If **No**, only Admins can invite.
*   **Enable non-Admins to create/manage groups?**: If **Yes**, Standard members can create and manage [groups](/products/pro/documenting/groups/). If **No**, only Admins can manage groups.

### Organization domains
(Managed under **Settings > Organization > Domains**)

#### What is Organization Domains?
Under **Settings > Organization > Domains**, you list your company's email domains (e.g., `yourcompany.com`). These domains are used to:

*   **Distinguish Members vs. Guests**: Tallyfy uses this list to identify internal members (email matches a listed domain) compared to external guests.
*   **Enable Auto Join**: If **ON**, anyone signing up for Tallyfy with an email matching your listed domains will automatically join *your* organization. This is usually recommended to prevent employees from creating separate accounts.

#### How to Add a Domain
To add or manage your organization's email domains:
1. Navigate to **Settings > Organization > Domains** in your Tallyfy application.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to add, edit, or remove domains from the list.

### Content creation settings

*   **Enable HTML authoring?**: If **Yes**, users can edit the HTML code directly in text editors (for advanced formatting). If **No**, they use the standard visual editor.
*   **Set new templates viewable by creator/Admin only?**: If **Yes**, newly created [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) are initially visible only to the creator and Admins until explicitly shared.

### Task management settings

*   **Auto-complete overdue tasks?**: If **Yes**, Tallyfy automatically marks [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) complete if they pass their deadline by a set amount of time (e.g., 2 months). This helps clear old, incomplete tasks.
*   **Auto-archive completed processes?**: If **Yes**, Tallyfy automatically archives [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) a set number of weeks after all their tasks are completed. This helps keep your active [Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/) view clean.
*   **Default deadline for tasks**: Set a default deadline (e.g., 3 days) applied to new tasks or template steps if no specific deadline is chosen.

### Onboarding settings

*   **Launch template for new members**: Choose a specific [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) to automatically launch for every new [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) joining your organization. This is useful for standard employee onboarding procedures. See [Auto-launch templates guide](/products/pro/settings/org-settings/how-to-auto-launch-templates-for-new-members/).

### Working hours and schedule

*   **Default work week**: Select your organization's standard work days (e.g., Mon-Fri). This affects how deadlines are calculated.
*   **Default working hours**: Set the start and end times for your standard workday. Deadlines adjust based on these hours.
    See [Customize work week guide](/products/pro/settings/org-settings/how-to-adjust-task-deadlines-to-work-week/).

### Notification settings

*   **Default email digest days (Members/Guests)**: Set the default days *new* members and guests get summary emails. Users can change their personal settings later.

### Webhook date formatting

*   **Format of webhook date field values**: Choose the date format for data sent via [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) (important for integrations).

### Saving changes

Remember to click **Save Changes** at the bottom after adjusting settings in this section.
