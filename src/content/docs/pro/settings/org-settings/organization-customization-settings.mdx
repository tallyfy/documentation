## Customizing organization settings

Settings found under **Settings > Organization > Customization** control how Tallyfy operates for everyone in your organization.

:::note[Admin only]
Only users with the Administrator role can access and change these settings.
:::

### Member permissions

*   **Allow non-Admins to invite members?**: If **Yes**, Standard members can also invite other members (limited to Standard or Light roles only). If **No**, only Administrators have invitation privileges.
*   **Enable non-Admins to create/manage groups?**: If **Yes**, Standard members can create and manage [groups](/products/pro/documenting/groups/). If **No**, only Administrators can manage group operations.

### Organization domains
(Managed under **Settings > Organization > Domains**)

#### Domain configuration
Under **Settings > Organization > Domains**, you configure your company's email domains (e.g., `yourcompany.com`). These domains:

*   **Distinguish Members vs. Guests**: Tallyfy uses this list to automatically identify internal members (email matches a listed domain) compared to external guests.
*   **Enable Auto Join functionality**: If **ON**, anyone signing up for Tallyfy with an email matching your listed domains will automatically join *your* organization. This is typically recommended to prevent employees from accidentally creating separate accounts.

#### Adding domains
To add or manage your organization's email domains:
1. Navigate to **Settings > Organization > Domains** in your Tallyfy application.
2. Follow the detailed on-screen instructions to add, edit, or remove domains from your organization's list.

### Content creation

*   **Enable HTML authoring?**: If **Yes**, users can edit HTML code directly in text editors (for advanced formatting capabilities). If **No**, they use the standard visual editor interface.
*   **Set new templates viewable by creator/Admin only?**: If **Yes**, newly created [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) are initially visible only to the creator and Administrators until explicitly shared with other users.

### Task management

*   **Auto-complete overdue tasks?**: If **Yes**, Tallyfy automatically marks [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) complete if they exceed their deadline by a specified amount of time (e.g., 2 months).
*   **Auto-archive completed processes?**: If **Yes**, Tallyfy automatically archives [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) a specified number of weeks after all their tasks are completed.
*   **Default deadline for tasks**: Configure a default deadline (e.g., 3 days) that applies to new tasks or template steps when no specific deadline is chosen.

### Onboarding settings

*   **Launch template for new members**: Select a specific [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) to automatically launch for every new [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) joining your organization. See [Auto-launch templates guide](/products/pro/settings/org-settings/how-to-auto-launch-templates-for-new-members/).

### Working hours and schedules

*   **Default work week**: Select your organization's standard work days (e.g., Mon-Fri).
*   **Default working hours**: Configure the start and end times for your standard workday. Deadlines automatically adjust based on these hours.
    See [Customize work week guide](/products/pro/settings/org-settings/how-to-adjust-task-deadlines-to-work-week/).

### Notification settings

*   **Default email digest days (Members/Guests)**: Configure the default days that *new* members and guests receive summary emails. Individual users can modify their personal settings later if needed.

### Webhook date formatting

*   **Format of webhook date field values**: Select the date format for data sent via [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/).

### Saving changes

Click **Save Changes** at the bottom of the page after adjusting settings.
