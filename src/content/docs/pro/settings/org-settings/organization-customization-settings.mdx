## Customize organization-wide behaviors and defaults

The Customization section in Organization Settings provides administrators with controls to tailor Tallyfy to their organization's specific needs. These settings affect how [members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) interact with the platform, how [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) are managed, and establish default behaviors for the entire organization.

:::note[Administrator access required]
These settings are only accessible to users with the Administrator role in your organization.
:::

## Member permissions settings

### Allow non-Administrator roles to invite members

Controls whether users in non-Administrator roles can [invite new members](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-to-invite-and-activate-members-on-tallyfy/) to the organization.

- When enabled: Non-Administrator members can invite others, but only at their own permission level or lower. For example, a Standard role member can only invite another member in Standard role, not in Administrator role.
- When disabled: Only Administrators can invite new members, providing stricter control over who joins the organization.

### Enable non-Administrators to create and manage groups

Controls whether users in non-Administrator roles can create and administer [groups](/products/pro/documenting/groups/).

- When enabled: Non-Administrator members can create groups and add/remove members from groups.
- When disabled: Only Administrators can create and manage groups, ensuring centralized control of organizational structure.

## Organization domains

Administrators can manage the email domains associated with their organization. This section defines how Tallyfy identifies internal members versus external guests and controls automatic joining.

### Defining members and guests

Tallyfy uses your organization's domains to determine whether a user is a billable **Member** or a non-billable **Guest**.

-   **Members:** Anyone signing up or invited with an email address matching one of the domains listed here (e.g., `yourname@yourcompany.com`) is considered an internal member of your organization. Members typically have broader access and permissions depending on their [assigned role](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-do-i-manage-member-permissions-in-tallyfy/).
-   **Guests:** Users with email addresses from domains *not* listed here are considered external guests. Guests usually have more limited access, often invited to specific [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) or tasks.

:::note[Current domain usage]
Currently, domains are used solely for identifying members versus guests and for the Auto Join feature described below. They are not used for other purposes like custom DNS routing or email aliasing.
:::

### Auto Join setting

This setting controls whether new users signing up for Tallyfy with an email address matching one of your organization's domains are automatically added to your organization.

-   **When enabled:** Any user signing up with a matching domain email (e.g., `employee@yourcompany.com`) will automatically join your existing Tallyfy organization. This helps ensure all employees within your company collaborate within the same Tallyfy instance, preventing accidental creation of separate, duplicate organizations.
-   **When disabled:** Users signing up with a matching domain email will not automatically join. They would need an explicit invitation from an existing member (if permissions allow) or an Administrator.

:::tip[Why use Auto Join?]
Enabling Auto Join is recommended for most companies to centralize Tallyfy usage and maintain organizational structure. It prevents employees from inadvertently creating multiple, isolated organizations. Remember, content and data within one Tallyfy organization are completely separate and not visible to users in another organization.
:::

## Content creation settings

### Enable HTML authoring throughout Tallyfy

Controls the ability to use HTML in the rich text editor for task descriptions and other text fields.

- When enabled: Users can manipulate HTML directly in text fields, allowing for more advanced formatting options.
- When disabled: Standard rich text formatting is available without direct HTML editing.

:::warning[Use with caution]
If you enable HTML authoring, ensure your users understand HTML basics to prevent formatting issues.
:::

### Set new templates to be viewable by the creator and Administrator role only

Controls the default visibility settings for newly created [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).

- When enabled: New templates are only visible to their creator and users with Administrator roles until explicitly shared.
- When disabled: New templates follow standard visibility rules.

This setting helps prevent clutter from unfinished templates by hiding works-in-progress from regular users until they're ready for broader use.

## Task management settings

### Auto-complete incomplete tasks

Automatically completes [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) that remain unfinished after a specified deadline.

- When enabled: Tasks are marked as complete after the specified period passes beyond their deadline.
- Options: Choose from preset time periods like "2 months over deadline"

This feature prevents task debt from building up and keeps your system clear of long-overdue items that users have forgotten to complete.

### Default deadline for tasks in this organization

Sets the default deadline period for new tasks when they are created, as well as for new steps within [procedure templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/).

- Enter a number and select the unit (days) to establish your organization's standard task completion timeframe.
- This default applies whenever a new task is created without a specific deadline.

## Onboarding settings

### Launch template for new members

Automatically launches a specific [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) for [new members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) when they join the organization.

- When enabled: Select a template from the dropdown that will be auto-launched for every new member upon account activation.
- This creates a structured onboarding experience and helps train new members on your processes and platform use.

For detailed information on this feature, see [Auto-launch templates for new members](/products/pro/settings/org-settings/how-to-auto-launch-templates-for-new-members/).

## Working hours and schedule

### Default work week

Defines which days are considered working days in your organization.

- Select from the available options (5-day, 6-day, 7-day work weeks)
- The selected work week affects how deadlines are calculated.

### Default working hours to auto-calculate new deadlines

Sets the standard working hours for each day in your organization.

- Configure the start and end times for the workday.
- Deadlines will not fall outside these hours or on non-working days.

For more details on setting up your organization's work schedule, see [Customize work week](/products/pro/settings/org-settings/how-to-adjust-task-deadlines-to-work-week/).

## Notification settings

### Default email digest days for new members

Sets the default email notification preferences for new members joining your organization.

- Select which days of the week new members will receive digest emails by default.
- Members can later customize these settings in their personal preferences.

### Default email digest days for new guests

Sets the default email notification preferences for [new guests](/products/pro/documenting/guests/) invited to your organization.

- Select which days of the week new guests will receive digest emails by default.
- Guests can later customize these settings in their personal preferences.

## Webhook date formatting

### Format of webhook date field values

Determines how date values are formatted in [webhook integrations](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/).

- Choose between standard formats like ISO 8601 or other common date formats.
- This setting affects all webhook integrations for your organization.
