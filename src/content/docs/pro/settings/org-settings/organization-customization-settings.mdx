## How can I customize my organization's Tallyfy settings?

This comprehensive section covers settings found under **Settings > Organization > Customization**. Administrators use these powerful settings to control how Tallyfy<sup>Â®</sup> operates for everyone in the organization.

:::note[Admin only]
Only users with the Administrator role can access and change these settings.
:::

### How do member permissions settings work?

*   **Allow non-Admins to invite members?**: If **Yes**, Standard members can also invite other members (limited to Standard or Light roles only). If **No**, only Administrators have invitation privileges.
*   **Enable non-Admins to create/manage groups?**: If **Yes**, Standard members can create and manage [groups](/products/pro/documenting/groups/). If **No**, only Administrators can manage group operations.

### How do organization domains work in Tallyfy?
(Managed under **Settings > Organization > Domains**)

#### What are Organization Domains?
Under **Settings > Organization > Domains**, you configure your company's email domains (e.g., `yourcompany.com`). These domains serve two critical purposes:

*   **Distinguish Members vs. Guests**: Tallyfy uses this list to automatically identify internal members (email matches a listed domain) compared to external guests.
*   **Enable Auto Join functionality**: If **ON**, anyone signing up for Tallyfy with an email matching your listed domains will automatically join *your* organization. This is typically recommended to prevent employees from accidentally creating separate accounts.

#### How do I add a domain to my organization?
To add or manage your organization's email domains:
1. Navigate to **Settings > Organization > Domains** in your Tallyfy application.
2. Follow the detailed on-screen instructions to add, edit, or remove domains from your organization's list.

### How do content creation settings work?

*   **Enable HTML authoring?**: If **Yes**, users can edit HTML code directly in text editors (for advanced formatting capabilities). If **No**, they use the standard visual editor interface.
*   **Set new templates viewable by creator/Admin only?**: If **Yes**, newly created [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) are initially visible only to the creator and Administrators until explicitly shared with other users.

### How do task management settings optimize workflow?

*   **Auto-complete overdue tasks?**: If **Yes**, Tallyfy automatically marks [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) complete if they exceed their deadline by a specified amount of time (e.g., 2 months). This feature helps clear old, incomplete tasks automatically.
*   **Auto-archive completed processes?**: If **Yes**, Tallyfy automatically archives [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) a specified number of weeks after all their tasks are completed. This automation helps keep your active [Tracker](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/) view organized and clean.
*   **Default deadline for tasks**: Configure a default deadline (e.g., 3 days) that applies to new tasks or template steps when no specific deadline is chosen.

### How do onboarding settings work for new members?

*   **Launch template for new members**: Select a specific [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) to automatically launch for every new [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) joining your organization. This powerful feature is essential for standardized employee onboarding procedures. See [Auto-launch templates guide](/products/pro/settings/org-settings/how-to-auto-launch-templates-for-new-members/).

### How do working hours and schedule settings affect deadlines?

*   **Default work week**: Select your organization's standard work days (e.g., Mon-Fri). This configuration directly affects how task deadlines are calculated.
*   **Default working hours**: Configure the start and end times for your standard workday. All deadlines automatically adjust based on these specified hours.
    See [Customize work week guide](/products/pro/settings/org-settings/how-to-adjust-task-deadlines-to-work-week/).

### How do notification settings control email communications?

*   **Default email digest days (Members/Guests)**: Configure the default days that *new* members and guests receive summary emails. Individual users can modify their personal settings later if needed.

### How does webhook date formatting work?

*   **Format of webhook date field values**: Select the date format for data sent via [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/) (critical for external integrations).

### How do I save my customization changes?

Always remember to click **Save Changes** at the bottom of the page after adjusting any settings in this section.
