## Customizing organization settings

Go to **Settings > Organization > Customization** to control how Tallyfy works for everyone in your org.

:::note[Admin only]
Only Administrators can access and change these settings.
:::

### Member permissions

*   **Allow non-Admins to invite members?** - If **Yes**, Standard members can invite others (limited to Standard or Light roles). If **No**, only Administrators can send invites.
*   **Allow non-Admins to create/manage groups?** - If **Yes**, Standard members can create and manage [groups](/products/pro/documenting/groups/). If **No**, only Administrators handle groups.

### Organization domains

Managed under **Settings > Organization > Domains**.

#### Domain configuration

Add your company's email domains (e.g., `yourcompany.com`) under **Settings > Organization > Domains**. These domains serve two purposes:

*   **Distinguish members vs. guests** - Tallyfy uses this list to identify internal members (email matches a listed domain) vs. external guests.
*   **Auto Join** - If **ON**, anyone signing up with an email matching your domains automatically joins your org. This prevents employees from accidentally creating separate accounts.

#### Adding domains

1. Go to **Settings > Organization > Domains**.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to add, edit, or remove domains.

### Content creation

*   **Enable HTML authoring?** - If **Yes**, users can edit HTML directly in text editors for advanced formatting. If **No**, they use the standard visual editor.
*   **Set new templates viewable by creator/Admin only?** - If **Yes**, newly created [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) are visible only to the creator and Administrators until shared.

### Task management

*   **Auto-complete overdue tasks?** - If **Yes**, Tallyfy automatically marks [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) complete when they exceed their deadline by a set number of months (configurable from 2 to 24 months).
*   **Auto-archive completed processes?** - If **Yes**, Tallyfy archives [processes](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) after a set period (1-90 days or weeks) once all tasks are done.
*   **Default deadline for tasks** - Set a fallback deadline (e.g., 3 days) that applies to new tasks or template steps when no specific deadline is chosen. Supports minutes, hours, days, weeks, or months.

### Onboarding settings

*   **Launch template for new members** - Pick a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) to auto-launch for every new [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) who joins. See [Auto-launch templates guide](/products/pro/settings/org-settings/how-to-auto-launch-templates-for-new-members/).

### Working hours and schedules

*   **Default work week** - Select your org's standard work days (e.g., Mon-Fri).
*   **Default working hours** - Set start and end times for the workday. Deadlines adjust based on these hours. See [Customize work week guide](/products/pro/settings/org-settings/how-to-adjust-task-deadlines-to-work-week/).

### Notification settings

*   **Default email digest days (Members/Guests)** - Set the default days *new* members and guests receive summary emails. Users can change their own schedule later.

### Webhook date formatting

*   **Format of webhook date field values** - Choose the date format for data sent via [webhooks](/products/pro/integrations/webhooks/).
