snippet: Advanced users can configure custom SMTP settings to control email sending
  while being aware that this bypasses Tallyfy's BIMI authentication and logo display
  features.
---

This feature is intended for advanced users who need specific control over their email sending infrastructure.

:::caution[Impact on BIMI Compliance]
Using Custom SMTP means emails originate from your servers, not Tallyfy's. This bypasses Tallyfy's BIMI configuration, and the official Tallyfy logo will not be displayed next to these emails in recipients' inboxes. Authentication and potential logo display will depend on your own domain's configuration. Read more about [Tallyfy's BIMI compliance](/products/pro/compliance/bimi-compliance/).
