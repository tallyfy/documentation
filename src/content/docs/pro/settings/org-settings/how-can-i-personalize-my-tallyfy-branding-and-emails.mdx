## Customizing Tallyfy with your organization's branding

Admins can customize Tallyfy to match your company's visual identity - including your logo, brand colors, guest-facing interfaces, and custom CSS styling.

### Changing logo and colors

<Steps>
1.  Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Branding**.
2.  Upload your company logo.
3.  Pick a brand color from the 14 predefined swatches, or type a specific hex code (e.g., `#FF5733`). Tallyfy auto-generates matching shades for text, links, and UI elements.
4.  Check the live preview - it shows how both the app and emails will look with your branding.
</Steps>

:::tip[Logo upload requirements and troubleshooting]
**File format**: JPG, JPEG, PNG, and GIF formats are supported.
**Recommended size**: 200x50 pixels (or similar aspect ratio)
**File size**: Maximum 10 MB
**Troubleshooting**: If your logo shows as a spinning circle or won't upload:
- Resize to recommended dimensions
- Clear browser cache and try again
- Try a different browser if issues persist

### Customizing content style with global CSS

:::note[Advanced feature]
This requires knowledge of CSS.
:::

You can add custom CSS rules to change how headings, lists, tables, and other elements appear in task descriptions, [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), and [documents](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) across your Tallyfy account.

For example, you could make all H2 headings use a specific brand color, or restyle tables to match your corporate design.

<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Branding**.
2. Click **Edit Global CSS**.
3. Enter your CSS rules in the code editor.
</Steps>

```css
ul,
ol {
  list-style-position: outside;
  padding-left: 1rem !important;
}
ul {
  list-style-type: none;
}
ul li {
  vertical-align: middle;
}
ul li::before {
  content: "▪";
  color: #f26523;
  display: inline-block;
  align-items: center;
  width: 1rem;
  margin-left: -1rem;
  font-size: 22px;
  vertical-align: middle;
}
table {
  margin-left: 0 !important;
  width: 100% !important;
}
table tbody tr td {
  padding: 8px 12px;
}
table > thead tr td,
table > tbody:first-child tr:first-child td {
  background: #f26523;
}
table > thead tr td,
table > thead tr td *,
table > tbody:first-child tr:first-child td,
table > tbody:first-child tr:first-child td * {
  color: white !important;
}
table > tbody:first-child tr:nth-child(odd):not(:first-child) td,
table > tbody:not(:first-child) tr:nth-child(odd) td {
  background-color: white;
}
table tbody tr:nth-child(even) td {
  background-color: #f2f2f2;
}
h1,
h1 * {
  font-weight: 400 !important;
}
h1,
h2,
h3 {
  margin-top: 1rem !important;
  margin-bottom: 1rem !important;
}
```

### Why complete white-labeling isn't available

Tallyfy offers extensive branding options, but complete white-labeling (hiding all Tallyfy references) isn't feasible. Here's why.

#### Technical limitations

*   **Security compliance**: [HSTS](/products/pro/compliance/hsts-compliance/) and [BIMI](/products/pro/compliance/bimi-compliance/) compliance are tied to the `tallyfy.com` domain. These security protocols can't function on custom domains.
*   **JavaScript library restrictions**: Several JavaScript libraries and security components can only run on the `tallyfy.com` domain for security and licensing reasons.
*   **Clickjacking protection**: Security controls prevent logins and signups outside the Tallyfy domain, protecting users from phishing attacks.

#### Operational realities

*   **Documentation**: This user manual is hosted on `tallyfy.com`. Your users will need access to help docs, revealing Tallyfy as the platform.
*   **Support**: Unless you handle 100% of support internally, users will contact [Tallyfy support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/) - immediately revealing the vendor.
*   **Compliance**: SOC 2 Type 2 certifications are assigned to Tallyfy, Inc. You can't hide Tallyfy's existence in the compliance lifecycle.
*   **Billing**: While [Tallyfy partners](/products/pro/miscellaneous/how-can-i-become-a-tallyfy-partner/) can use "unbilled domains" to exclude their consulting domain from client billing, invoices still show "Tallyfy" as the service provider.

#### What you can customize

*   **Visual branding**: Your logo, colors, and custom CSS across the app
*   **Email sending**: Configure [custom SMTP](/products/pro/integrations/email/how-to-set-up-custom-smtp-in-tallyfy/) so emails come from your own server
*   **Partner options**: The [Ambassador program](https://tallyfy.com/partners/) provides extra branding options for qualified partners

### Setting up custom email sending (SMTP)

You can configure Tallyfy to send all emails through your company's email server instead of Tallyfy's default. This keeps your brand consistent across all email communications. Learn more: [Customize email sending](/products/pro/integrations/email/how-to-set-up-custom-smtp-in-tallyfy/).
