## Customizing Tallyfy with your branding

Administrators can customize Tallyfy to match your company branding.

### What you can customize

*   **Logo**: Show your company logo in Tallyfy task views and emails.
*   **Colors**: Use your brand colors in the member interface and emails.
*   **Guest Views**: Provide a professional, branded experience for external guests.
*   **Global CSS**: Add custom CSS code to change standard styles (like headings or tables) across Tallyfy.

### How to change logo and colors

<Steps>
1.  Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Branding**.
2.  Upload your company logo.
3.  Choose your primary brand color using the color picker or by entering a Hex code (e.g., `#FF5733`).
4.  Check the preview to see how tasks and processes will appear with your branding.

### Customizing content style with global CSS

:::note[Advanced feature]
This requires knowledge of CSS.

You can add CSS rules to change how standard elements (like headings, lists, or tables) look in task descriptions, [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/), and [documents](/products/pro/documenting/documents/) across your Tallyfy account.

For example, you could make all H2 headings a specific color or adjust the default table style.

To add CSS:
<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Branding**.
2. Click **Edit Global CSS**.
3. Enter your custom CSS rules in the provided field.

### Full white-labeling

Tallyfy doesn't currently offer complete white-labeling (removing all Tallyfy branding). However, partners in our [Ambassador program](https://tallyfy.com/partners/) may have different options. See the [Partner page](https://tallyfy.com/partners/) for details.

### Custom email sending (SMTP)

You can configure Tallyfy to send emails via your company's email server instead of Tallyfy's default service. Learn more: [Customize email sending](/products/pro/integrations/email/how-to-set-up-custom-smtp-in-tallyfy/).
