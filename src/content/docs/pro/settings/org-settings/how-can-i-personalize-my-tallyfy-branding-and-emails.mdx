## How to customize and use your branding colors and logo in Tallyfy

Tallyfy Help Article: Customizing Branding and Emails

Welcome to Tallyfy, where you can personalize your organization's brand and make your emails look amazing! Let's dive into how you can easily customize your logo, and colors, and even add your own CSS rules.

Branding:

- Show off your custom logo in task views and emails
- Display your unique colors in all member task views and emails
- Impress your guests with branded views

To change your logo and colors, simply go to Settings > Organization > Branding. Here, you can see a preview of how your fully branded task and process view will look like. Take a look at the example image below:

## Global CSS:

Tallyfy has a brilliant feature which enables you to add custom CSS rules globally to all your content so that the default styling of your content looks perfect, and on-brand. Examples of this include making all headings have a certain design or color, making tables look like your branded design, etc.

To add custom CSS, go to **Settings > Organization > Branding** and click on the "Edit Global CSS" button. Here, you can add your custom CSS rules.

Note that CSS added within the Settings > Organization > Branding section here applies globally - to all task descriptions and templates (documents, step descriptions, etc.):

:::

We suggest this default CSS to immediately make your content look beautiful - and also as a base from which you can customize things to suit your brand.
