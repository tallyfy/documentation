## How to customize and use your branding colors and logo in Tallyfy

Tallyfy allows organizations to personalize their branding by customizing logos, colors, and adding custom CSS rules.

Branding options include:

- Display your organization's logo in task views and emails
- Apply your brand colors to all member task views and emails
- Provide branded interfaces for external guests

To change your logo and colors, navigate to Settings > Organization > Branding. A preview of your branded task and process view will be displayed, as shown in the example below:

## Global CSS:

Tallyfy has a brilliant feature which enables you to add custom CSS rules globally to all your content so that the default styling of your content looks perfect, and on-brand. Examples of this include making all headings have a certain design or color, making tables look like your branded design, etc.

To add custom CSS, go to **Settings > Organization > Branding** and click on the "Edit Global CSS" button. Here, you can add your custom CSS rules.

Note that CSS added within the Settings > Organization > Branding section here applies globally - to all task descriptions and templates (documents, step descriptions, etc.):

The following default CSS can be used as a starting point for customization to match your brand.

```css
ul,
ol {
  list-style-position: outside;
  padding-left: 1rem !important;
}
ul {
  list-style-type: none;
}
