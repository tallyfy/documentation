## Customizing Tallyfy with your branding

Administrators can customize Tallyfy to match your company's brand.

### What you can customize

*   **Logo**: Display your company logo in Tallyfy task views and emails.
*   **Colors**: Apply your brand colors to the member interface and emails.
*   **Guest Views**: Provide a branded experience for external guests using tasks.
*   **Global CSS**: Add custom CSS code to change default styles (like headings or tables) across Tallyfy.

### How to change logo and colors

<Steps>
1.  Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Branding**.
2.  Upload your company logo.
3.  Choose your primary brand color using the color picker or by entering a Hex code (like `#FF5733`).
4.  Check the preview to see how tasks and processes will look with your branding.

### Customizing content style with global CSS

:::note[Advanced feature]
This requires knowledge of CSS.

You can add your own CSS rules to change how standard elements look inside task descriptions, templates, and documents across your Tallyfy account.

For example, you could make all H2 headings a specific color or change the default table style.

To add CSS:
<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Branding**.
2. Click **Edit Global CSS**.
3. Add your custom CSS rules.
</Steps>

```css
ul,
ol {
  list-style-position: outside;
  padding-left: 1rem !important;
}
ul {
  list-style-type: none;
}
ul li {
  vertical-align: middle;
}
ul li::before {
  content: "â–ª";
  color: #f26523;
  display: inline-block;
  align-items: center;
  width: 1rem;
  margin-left: -1rem;
  font-size: 22px;
  vertical-align: middle;
}
table {
  margin-left: 0 !important;
  width: 100% !important;
}
table tbody tr td {
  padding: 8px 12px;

  color: white !important;
}

table > tbody:not(:first-child) tr:nth-child(odd) td {
  background-color: white;
}
table tbody tr:nth-child(even) td {
  background-color: #f2f2f2;

  margin-top: 1rem !important;
  margin-bottom: 1rem !important;

froala-bp-view .process-timeline {

```

### Full white-labeling

Tallyfy does not currently offer complete white-labeling (removing all Tallyfy branding). However, partners in our [Ambassador program](https://tallyfy.com/partners/) might have different options. See the [Partner page](https://tallyfy.com/partners/) for details.

### Custom email sending (SMTP)

You can set up Tallyfy to send emails using your company's email server instead of Tallyfy's default. Learn more here: [Customize email sending](/products/pro/integrations/email/how-to-set-up-custom-smtp-in-tallyfy/).
