## Member status types

In **Settings > Organization > Members**, you'll see different statuses next to each person's name. These show their access level and billing status.

### Member status types explained

| Status             | What it Means                                                  | Does it Cost?              |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Active**         | A normal user who can log in and use Tallyfy (based on role). | Yes (Billed)               |
| **Invited**        | You sent them an invitation, but they haven't accepted yet.      | No (Not billed until active) |
| **Deactivated**    | You removed them; they cannot log in or use Tallyfy anymore.   | No (Not billed)            |
| **Bot / Unbilled** | Special account (e.g., for integrations or partners) that doesn't count towards your bill. | No (Not billed)            |

### Active status

"Active" means the [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) has joined and can use Tallyfy based on their assigned role (Admin, Standard, or Light). Active members count towards your paid licenses.

### Invited status

"Invited" means you've sent an invitation, but the person hasn't clicked the email link and set up their password yet. They can't use Tallyfy, and you aren't billed for them.

Once they accept, their status changes to **Active**, and billing begins.

### Deactivated status

"Deactivated" means an Administrator has removed the member from the organization. They can no longer log in. When you deactivate someone, Tallyfy helps you [reassign their tasks](/products/pro/settings/org-settings/how-can-i-remove-a-member-from-my-tallyfy-organization/). They no longer count towards your paid licenses.

### Bot / unbilled status

This is a special status usually set by Tallyfy admins or support for special cases:

*   **Integration Accounts**: Accounts used by software connecting to Tallyfy via the API.
*   **Partner/Consultant Accounts**: If you use the [Domain Exclusion feature](/products/pro/miscellaneous/how-can-i-become-a-tallyfy-partner/) for partners, their accounts might show as "Unbilled".
*   **Tallyfy Bot**: Every organization also has a system user named "Tallyfy Bot". This unbilled user posts automated comments (e.g., when a rule triggers a task) and performs system actions where a specific human user cannot be attributed. It cannot be assigned tasks, edited, or deleted.

These accounts can access Tallyfy but do **not** count towards your paid member total.

## Managing member statuses

Administrators can see and manage member statuses in **Settings > Organization > Members**. Here you can:

1.  [Invite new members](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-to-invite-and-activate-members-on-tallyfy/) (they start as Invited).
2.  [Deactivate members](/products/pro/settings/org-settings/how-can-i-remove-a-member-from-my-tallyfy-organization/) (changes status to Deactivated).
3.  See the current status of everyone listed.

Understanding these statuses helps manage user access and your Tallyfy bill.
