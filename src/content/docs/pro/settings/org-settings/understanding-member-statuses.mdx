## Understanding Member Statuses in Tallyfy

When managing your team in Tallyfy, you'll see different [member statuses](/products/pro/documenting/members/) in the **Settings > Organization > Member** section. Each status indicates both the activity state of the member and their current billing status.

### Member Status Types

| Status | Description | Billing Impact |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **Active** | Normal active member with full access to Tallyfy based on their role | Being billed |
| **Invited** | Member has been invited but has not yet accepted the invitation | Not billed until they accept the invitation |
| **Deactivated** | Member has been removed from Tallyfy and can no longer access the system | Not being billed |
| **Bot/Unbilled** | Special member account that is not subject to billing | Not being billed |

### Active Status

An **Active** member is a fully onboarded user who:
- Has accepted their invitation
- Has full access to Tallyfy according to their [assigned role](/products/pro/documenting/members/)
- Is counted towards your organization's billing

Active members can access all features permitted by their assigned role (Administrator, Standard, or Light) and are included in your monthly/annual billing.

### Invited Status

A member with **Invited** status:
- Has been sent an invitation but has not yet accepted it
- Cannot access Tallyfy until they accept the invitation
- Is not being billed until they accept the invitation and become Active

Once the [invited member](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-to-invite-and-activate-members-on-tallyfy/) accepts the invitation, their status automatically changes to Active, and billing begins for that member.

### Deactivated Status

A **Deactivated** member:
- Has been removed from the organization
- Can no longer access Tallyfy
- Is not included in billing
- Has their [assigned tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) redistributed through conflict resolution

Deactivating a member is the proper way to remove someone from your organization while ensuring all their work is properly reassigned.

### Bot/Unbilled Status

The **Bot** or **Unbilled** status is special and indicates:
- The account is a member of your organization
- The account is not subject to billing
- Typically used for [integration accounts](/products/pro/integrations/), system accounts, or special purpose accounts

These accounts do not count toward your paid member total but can still interact with Tallyfy as needed for their specific purpose.

## Managing Member Statuses

As an Administrator, you can view and manage member statuses by navigating to **Settings > Organization > Members**. From there, you can:

1. [Invite new members](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-to-invite-and-activate-members-on-tallyfy/)
2. [Deactivate existing members](/products/pro/documenting/members/)
3. View the current status of all members in your organization

Understanding these statuses helps ensure you're properly managing both access and billing for your Tallyfy organization.
