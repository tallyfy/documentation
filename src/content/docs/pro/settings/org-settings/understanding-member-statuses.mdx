## Member status types in Tallyfy

In **Settings > Organization > Members**, you'll see different statuses next to each person's name. These indicate their access level and account status within your Tallyfy organization.

### Status types overview

| Status             | What it Means                                                  | Account Status              |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Active**         | A normal user who can log in and use Tallyfy (based on role). | Counts toward account limits               |
| **Invited**        | You sent them an invitation, but they haven't accepted yet.      | Does not count until active |
| **Deactivated**    | You removed them; they cannot log in or use Tallyfy anymore.   | Does not count            |
| **Bot / Unbilled** | Special account (e.g., for integrations or partners) that doesn't count towards your account. | Does not count            |

### Active status

"Active" means the [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) has joined and can use Tallyfy based on their assigned role (Admin, Standard, or Light). Active members count towards your account limits and have full access to platform features based on their role permissions.

### Invited status

"Invited" means you've sent an invitation, but the person hasn't clicked the email link and set up their password yet. They cannot use Tallyfy, and they don't count toward your account during this pending state.

Once they accept the invitation, their status automatically changes to **Active**, and they count toward your account limits.

### Deactivated status

"Deactivated" means an Administrator has removed the member from the organization. They can no longer log in or access any Tallyfy features. When you deactivate someone, Tallyfy helps you [reassign their tasks](/products/pro/settings/org-settings/how-can-i-remove-a-member-from-my-tallyfy-organization/) to other team members. Deactivated members no longer count towards your account limits.

#### Important deletion constraints

Before deactivating members, be aware of these system protections:

- **Default Administrator**: Cannot be deactivated until the role is transferred to another administrator
- **Last Administrator**: The final admin in an organization cannot be deactivated - promote another member first
- **Two-step process**: Members must be deactivated before permanent deletion from the system
- **Task reassignment**: All active tasks and template assignments must be reassigned or handled before deactivation completes

If you encounter errors during deactivation, see our [troubleshooting guide](/products/pro/settings/org-settings/troubleshooting-member-deletion/) for solutions.

### Bot/Unbilled status

This special status is usually set by Tallyfy admins or support for specific organizational needs:

*   **Integration Accounts**: Accounts used by software connecting to Tallyfy via the API.
*   **Partner/Consultant Accounts**: If you use the [Domain Exclusion feature](/products/pro/miscellaneous/how-can-i-become-a-tallyfy-partner/) for partners, their accounts might show as "Unbilled".
*   **Tallyfy Bot**: Every organization also has a system user named "Tallyfy Bot". This unbilled user posts automated comments (e.g., when a rule triggers a task) and performs system actions where a specific human user cannot be attributed. It cannot be assigned tasks, edited, or deleted.

These accounts can access Tallyfy but do **not** count towards your member total.

## Managing member statuses

Administrators can view and manage all member statuses in **Settings > Organization > Members**. This central location allows you to:

1.  [Invite new members](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-to-invite-and-activate-members-on-tallyfy/) (they start as Invited).
2.  [Deactivate members](/products/pro/settings/org-settings/how-can-i-remove-a-member-from-my-tallyfy-organization/) (changes status to Deactivated).
3.  See the current status of everyone listed.

Understanding these member statuses helps you effectively manage user access permissions and optimize your Tallyfy account.
