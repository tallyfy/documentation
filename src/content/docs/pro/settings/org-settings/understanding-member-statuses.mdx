title: Member statuses
---

Every person in your Tallyfy organization has a status you can check at **Settings > Organization > Members**. The status controls what they can do and whether they count toward your billing.

## Status types

| Status | Meaning | Counts toward billing? |
|---|---|---|
| **Active** | Can log in and use Tallyfy based on their role | Yes |
| **Invited** | Invitation sent, but not yet accepted | No |
| **Deactivated** | Removed from the organization - can't log in | No |
| **Bot / Unbilled** | Special account for integrations or partners | No |

## Active

An Active [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) has joined and can use Tallyfy based on their role (Admin, Standard, or Light). These members count toward your account limits.

## Invited

"Invited" means you've sent an invitation, but the person hasn't clicked the email link and set up their password yet. They can't use Tallyfy and don't count toward billing.

Once they accept, their status automatically changes to **Active**.

## Deactivated

An Administrator has removed this member. They can't log in or access anything in Tallyfy. When you deactivate someone, Tallyfy lets you [reassign their tasks](/products/pro/settings/org-settings/how-can-i-remove-a-member-from-my-tallyfy-organization/) to other team members. Deactivated members don't count toward billing.

### Deletion constraints

These protections apply when deactivating or deleting members:

- **Default Administrator** - If you deactivate a default admin who's also the only admin, you'll get an error. Promote another member to Admin first. If other admins exist, Tallyfy auto-transfers the default admin role.
- **Last Administrator** - The final admin in an organization can't be deactivated. Promote another member first.
- **Two-step deletion** - Members must be deactivated before you can permanently delete them.
- **Task reassignment** - You can reassign active tasks and template assignments to another member during deactivation.

Hit errors during deactivation? See the [troubleshooting guide](/products/pro/settings/org-settings/troubleshooting-member-deletion/).

## Bot / Unbilled

This status covers a few different cases:

- **Integration accounts** - Accounts used by software connecting to Tallyfy via the API.
- **Partner/Consultant accounts** - If you use the [Domain Exclusion feature](/products/pro/miscellaneous/how-can-i-become-a-tallyfy-partner/) for partners, their accounts show as "Unbilled".
- **Tallyfy Bot** - Every organization has a system user called "Tallyfy Bot". It posts automated comments (for example, when a rule triggers a task) and handles system actions that can't be attributed to a specific person. The bot can't be removed, edited, or assigned tasks.

These accounts can access Tallyfy but don't count toward your member total.

## Managing statuses

Administrators manage all member statuses at **Settings > Organization > Members**. From there you can:

1. [Invite new members](/products/pro/documenting/members/how-to-invite-and-activate-members-on-tallyfy/) - they start as Invited.
2. [Deactivate members](/products/pro/settings/org-settings/how-can-i-remove-a-member-from-my-tallyfy-organization/) - changes status to Deactivated.
3. View everyone's current status at a glance.
