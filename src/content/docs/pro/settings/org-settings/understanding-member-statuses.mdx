## Understanding Member Statuses in Tallyfy

When managing your team in Tallyfy, you'll see different member statuses in the **Settings > Organization > Member** section. Each status indicates both the activity state of the member and their current billing status.

### Member Status Types

| Status | Description | Billing Impact |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **Active** | Normal active member with full access to Tallyfy based on their role | Being billed |
| **Invited** | Member has been invited but has not yet accepted the invitation | Not billed until they accept the invitation |
| **Deactivated** | Member has been removed from Tallyfy and can no longer access the system | Not being billed |
| **Bot/Unbilled** | Special member account that is not subject to billing | Not being billed |

### Active Status

An **Active** member is a fully onboarded user who:
- Has accepted their invitation
- Has full access to Tallyfy according to their assigned role
- Is counted towards your organization's billing

Active members can access all features permitted by their assigned role (Administrator, Standard, or Light) and are included in your monthly/annual billing.

### Invited Status

A member with **Invited** status:
- Has been sent an invitation but has not yet accepted it
- Cannot access Tallyfy until they accept the invitation
- Is not being billed until they accept the invitation and become Active

Once the invited member accepts the invitation, their status automatically changes to Active, and billing begins for that member.

### Deactivated Status

A **Deactivated** member:
- Has been removed from the organization
- Can no longer access Tallyfy
- Is not included in billing
- Has their assigned tasks redistributed through conflict resolution

Deactivating a member is the proper way to remove someone from your organization while ensuring all their work is properly reassigned.

### Bot/Unbilled Status

The **Bot** or **Unbilled** status is special and indicates:
- The account is a member of your organization
- The account is not subject to billing
- Typically used for integration accounts, system accounts, or special purpose accounts

These accounts do not count toward your paid member total but can still interact with Tallyfy as needed for their specific purpose.

## Managing Member Statuses

As an Administrator, you can view and manage member statuses by navigating to **Settings > Organization > Members**. From there, you can:

1. Invite new members
2. Deactivate existing members
3. View the current status of all members in your organization

Understanding these statuses helps ensure you're properly managing both access and billing for your Tallyfy organization.
