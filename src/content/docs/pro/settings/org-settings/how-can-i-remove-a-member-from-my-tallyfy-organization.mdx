## How to remove a member from your organization

This article explains how administrators remove a [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) from your Tallyfy organization.

<Steps>
1. Go to your **Settings**.
2. Select **Organization**, then **Members**.
3. Click the name of the member you wish to remove.
4. Scroll down their profile and click **Deactivate Member**.

</Steps>

### Task reassignment (conflict resolution)

When you deactivate a member, Tallyfy helps reassign their pending [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) and any [template steps](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) currently assigned to them. This stops work from getting lost.

Tallyfy will prompt you to choose another active member to take over these tasks:

After you reassign the items, you'll get a confirmation that the member was removed.

### Checking who removed a member

You can find out who deactivated a member by viewing the deactivated member's profile (find them in the **Members** list, possibly using filters) and checking the **Activity** section near the bottom.
