## Remove a member from your Tallyfy organization

This article explains how to remove a member from your Tallyfy organization.

To remove a member from your organization, follow these steps:

1. Go to your **Settings**.
2. Select **Organization** and then **Members**.
3. Click on the name of the member you want to remove, scroll down, and select **Delete**!

Tallyfy uses a feature called **conflict resolution** to automatically reassign any pending tasks and templates owned by the deleted member to another active member. This prevents the need for manual reassignment.

You can find out who removed a member by selecting their name and checking the **Activity** section at the bottom of their profile.

Here's an example of how conflict resolution works on Tallyfy:


So, if the member you're removing had tasks or steps assigned to them, Tallyfy will prompt you to reassign them:

Finally, after you've performed the bulk re-assignment, you'll receive a confirmation message indicating that the member was removed successfully.
