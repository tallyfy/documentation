## How to remove a member from your organization

This article explains how Administrators can remove a [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) from your Tallyfy organization.

<Steps>
1. Go to your **Settings**.
2. Select **Organization** and then **Members**.
3. Click the name of the member you want to remove.
4. Scroll down in their profile and click **Deactivate Member**.

</Steps>

### Task reassignment (conflict resolution)

When you deactivate a member, Tallyfy helps you reassign their pending [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) and any [template steps](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) assigned to them. This prevents work from being lost.

Tallyfy will prompt you to choose another active member to take over these assignments:

After you reassign the items, you'll receive a confirmation that the member was removed successfully.

### Checking who removed a member

You can find out who deactivated a member by looking at the deactivated member's profile (find them in the **Members** list, possibly filtering by status) and checking the **Activity** section at the bottom.
