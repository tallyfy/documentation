## How can I remove a member from my Tallyfy organization?

This comprehensive guide explains how administrators can safely remove a [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) from your Tallyfy<sup>Â®</sup> organization while managing their existing responsibilities.

<Steps>
1. Navigate to your **Settings** panel.
2. Select **Organization**, then choose **Members**.
3. Click the name of the specific member you wish to remove.
4. Scroll down through their profile and click **Deactivate Member**.

</Steps>

### How does task reassignment work during member removal?

When you deactivate a member, Tallyfy automatically helps reassign their pending [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) and any [template steps](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) currently assigned to them. This critical process prevents work from being lost or forgotten.

Tallyfy will prompt you to select another active member to take over these responsibilities:

After you successfully reassign all items, you'll receive a confirmation message that the member has been completely removed from your organization.

### How can I check who removed a member from Tallyfy?

You can determine who deactivated a specific member by viewing the deactivated member's profile (locate them in the **Members** list, possibly using available filters) and checking the **Activity** section located near the bottom of their profile.
