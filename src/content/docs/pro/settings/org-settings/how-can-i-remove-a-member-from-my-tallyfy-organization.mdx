## How can I remove a member from my Tallyfy organization?

This comprehensive guide explains how administrators can safely remove a [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) from your Tallyfy organization while managing their existing responsibilities.

### Important deletion constraints

Before attempting to remove a member, understand these system requirements:

#### Two-step deletion process
Tallyfy requires members to be **disabled first** before permanent deletion. This safety mechanism prevents accidental data loss and ensures proper task reassignment.

#### Administrator protection rules
- **Default Administrator**: The member designated as default administrator cannot be removed until you transfer this role to another administrator. Navigate to **Organization Settings** and assign a different member as default administrator first.
- **Last Administrator**: You cannot remove the last administrator in your organization. Promote another member to administrator role before attempting removal.
- **Protected Accounts**: System accounts like "Tallyfy Bot" cannot be removed as they handle automated processes.

#### Common deletion blockers
If you're unable to remove a member, check:
1. **Is the member already disabled?** Check their status in the Members list
2. **Is this the default administrator?** Look for the "Default Admin" badge
3. **Is this your only administrator?** Verify you have another active admin
4. **Are there pending task reassignments?** Complete all reassignment dialogs

For detailed solutions, see our [troubleshooting guide](/products/pro/settings/org-settings/troubleshooting-member-deletion/).

<Steps>
1. Navigate to your **Settings** panel.
2. Select **Organization**, then choose **Members**.
3. Click the name of the specific member you wish to remove.
4. Scroll down through their profile and click **Deactivate Member**.

</Steps>

### How does task reassignment work during member removal?

When you deactivate a member, Tallyfy automatically helps reassign their pending [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) and any [template steps](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) currently assigned to them. This critical process prevents work from being lost or forgotten.

Tallyfy will prompt you to select another active member to take over these responsibilities:

After you successfully reassign all items, you'll receive a confirmation message that the member has been completely removed from your organization.


### How can I check who removed a member from Tallyfy?

You can determine who deactivated a specific member by viewing the deactivated member's profile (locate them in the **Members** list, possibly using available filters) and checking the **Activity** section located near the bottom of their profile.
