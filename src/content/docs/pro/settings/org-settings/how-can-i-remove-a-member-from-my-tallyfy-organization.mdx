## Removing a member from your organization

Admins can remove a [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) from a Tallyfy organization through a two-step process - disable first, then delete. This prevents accidental data loss and gives you a chance to reassign their work.

### Deletion constraints

#### Administrator protection
- **Default Administrator** - If the member being removed is the default admin and another member exists, Tallyfy auto-transfers the default admin role. If no other member exists, you'll see: "Cannot modify the default administrator. Please assign another member as default administrator first."
- **Last Administrator** - You can't remove the last admin. Promote another member to admin first.
- **Bot accounts** - System accounts like "Tallyfy Bot" can't be removed.

#### Common blockers

If you can't remove a member, check:
1. **Is the member already disabled?** Check their status in the Members list
2. **Is this the default administrator?** Look for the "Default Admin" badge
3. **Is this your only administrator?** Verify you have another active admin
4. **Are there pending task reassignments?** Complete all reassignment dialogs

For more help, see the [troubleshooting guide](/products/pro/settings/org-settings/troubleshooting-member-deletion/).

<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Members**.
2. Click the member's name.
3. Scroll down and click **Deactivate Member**.

</Steps>

### Task reassignment during removal

When you deactivate a member, Tallyfy prompts you to reassign their pending [tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) and [template steps](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) to another active member.

Once you've reassigned everything, Tallyfy confirms the member has been removed.

### Checking who removed a member

Find the deactivated member in the **Members** list (use filters if needed) and check the **Activity** section near the bottom of their profile. It shows who deactivated them.
