**Can't change your organization name?** During initial setup, the organization name field may be locked. This is by design to prevent accidental changes during configuration. To change your organization name after initial creation, contact [Tallyfy support](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/) for assistance.
