## Auto-launch a template for new members

You can automatically launch a [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) whenever a [new member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) joins your organization. Every new member gets the same onboarding experience - no manual work required.

### Before you start

- You need Administrator access to your Tallyfy organization
- Have an existing [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) ready for onboarding
- The template must be a procedure type (not a document) with at least one step, and can't have required kick-off form fields

### Setting up auto-launch

<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Customization**.
2. Find the **Onboarding new members** toggle and switch it to **Yes**.
3. A dropdown appears - select the template you want to auto-launch.
4. Click **Save Changes**.

</Steps>

### How it works

When a new member accepts their invitation and verifies their email:

1. The selected [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) launches as a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) assigned to that member
2. They get email notifications about their [assigned tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/)
3. The process shows up in their [Tasks view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/) right away
4. Standard tracking and completion rules apply

### Why use auto-launch

- **Consistent onboarding** - every new member gets the same process
- **Self-paced training** - members complete tasks on their own schedule
- **No manual work** - you don't have to launch onboarding processes one by one
- **Faster adoption** - members start using Tallyfy immediately
- **Avoids the [forgetting curve](/products/pro/tutorials/why-documentation-training-fails-forgetting-curve/)** - structured tasks beat one-time training sessions
- **Trackable progress** - monitor who's completed onboarding and who hasn't

### What to include in your onboarding template

- Welcome message and company info
- Tallyfy tutorial steps with links to help articles
- Introductions to key team members
- Required training materials or [compliance](/products/pro/compliance/) documents
- A feedback step at the end

### Good to know

- The template launches as soon as the new member activates their account
- Only one auto-launch template can be active at a time
- Administrators can track completion progress in the [Tracker view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)
- Pair this with [welcome snippets](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/) for a complete onboarding experience
