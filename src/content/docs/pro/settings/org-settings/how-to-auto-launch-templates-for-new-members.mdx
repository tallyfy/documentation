## How to automate new member onboarding with templates

Tallyfy offers an onboarding feature that allows organizations to automatically launch specific [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) for [new members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) when they join. This feature enables a structured, self-driven onboarding experience right from the start.

## Requirements

Before setting up auto-launch templates for new members, ensure you have:
- Administrator access to your Tallyfy organization
- A [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) designed for onboarding new members
- The template should be accessible to all members

## Setting up auto-launch templates

To configure a template to automatically launch for new members:

<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings** in the top right corner of your screen
2. Click on the **Organization** tab
3. Select **Customization**
4. Look for the **Launch template for new members?** option
5. Use the dropdown to select the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) you want to auto-launch for every new member
6. Save your changes
</Steps>

## How it works

Once configured, whenever a new member accepts their invitation and activates their account:

<Steps>
1. The selected [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) automatically launches as a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) assigned to the new member
2. The new member receives email notifications about their [assigned tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/)
3. The process appears in their [Tasks view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/), guiding them through the onboarding steps
4. The process follows all normal tracking and completion rules
</Steps>

## Benefits for adoption and training

This feature provides several key advantages:

- **Structured onboarding**: Every new member follows the same initial process, ensuring consistent onboarding
- **Self-driven training**: New members can complete training tasks at their own pace
- **Reduced administrative overhead**: No need to manually launch onboarding processes for each new hire
- **Increased adoption**: Members engage with the platform immediately through assigned tasks
- **Standardized knowledge transfer**: Ensure all new members receive the same critical information
- **Measurable completion**: Track which members have completed their onboarding process

## Template design recommendations

For effective new member onboarding, consider including these elements in your auto-launch template:

- Welcome message and company introduction
- Platform tutorial steps with links to help resources
- Introduction to key team members
- Required training materials and [compliance documentation](/products/pro/compliance/)
- Feedback collection at the end of the process

## Additional considerations

- The template launches immediately when a new member activates their account
- Only one template can be designated as the auto-launch template for new members
- The process name will follow your organization\\'s default naming convention
- Administrators can monitor template completion through the [Tracker view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)

This feature works alongside other onboarding tools like [welcome snippets](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/) to create a comprehensive onboarding experience.
