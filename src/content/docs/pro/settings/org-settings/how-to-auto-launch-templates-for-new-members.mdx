## How to automate new member onboarding with templates

Tallyfy lets organizations automatically launch specific [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) for [new members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) when they join. This provides a structured, self-guided onboarding experience from the start.

### Prerequisites

Before setting this up, ensure you have:
- Administrator access to your Tallyfy organization.
- An existing [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) designed for onboarding new members.
- The template must be accessible to all members.

### Setting up auto-launch templates

To configure a template to launch automatically for new members:

<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings** (usually top right).
2. Click the **Organization** tab.
3. Select **Customization**.
4. Find the **Launch template for new members?** setting.
5. Use the dropdown to select the [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) you want to auto-launch.
6. Click **Save Changes** at the bottom of the page.

</Steps>

### How it works

Once configured, when a new member accepts their invitation and activates their account:

1. The selected [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) automatically launches as a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) assigned to them.
2. They receive email notifications about their [assigned tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/).
3. The process appears in their [Tasks view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/), guiding them through onboarding.
4. The process follows standard tracking and completion rules.

### Benefits for adoption and training

Using this feature offers several advantages:

- **Structured onboarding**: Ensures every new member follows the same initial process.
- **Self-guided training**: Allows new members to complete training tasks at their own speed.
- **Reduced admin work**: Eliminates manual launching of onboarding processes.
- **Increased adoption**: Engages members with the platform immediately.
- **Standardized knowledge**: Delivers the same critical information to all new members.
- **Measurable completion**: Track onboarding progress easily.

### Template design recommendations

Consider including these in your auto-launch template:

- Welcome message and company overview.
- Platform tutorial steps (link to help resources).
- Introduction to key team members or contacts.
- Required training materials or [compliance](/products/pro/compliance/) documents.
- A step to collect feedback at the end.

### Additional considerations

- The template launches as soon as a new member activates their account.
- Only one template can be set as the auto-launch template.
- The launched process name will follow your organization's default naming rules.
- Admins can monitor completion via the [Tracker view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/).

This feature complements other tools like [welcome snippets](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/) for a full onboarding experience.
