## How to automate new member onboarding with templates

Tallyfy lets organizations automatically launch specific [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) for [new members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) when they join. This gives new members a structured start.

### Prerequisites

Before setting this up, make sure you have:
- Administrator access to your Tallyfy organization.
- An existing [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) designed for new member onboarding.
- The template must be available to all members (e.g., not restricted to certain roles or members in its settings).

### Setting up auto-launch templates

To set up a template to launch automatically for new members:

<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings**.
2. Click the **Organization** tab.
3. Select **Customization**.
4. Find the **Launch template for new members?** setting.
5. Use the dropdown menu to select the template you want to auto-launch.
6. Click **Save Changes** at the bottom of the page.

</Steps>

### How it works

Once set up, when a new member accepts their invitation and activates their account:

1. The chosen [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) automatically launches as a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) assigned to that new member.
2. They get email notifications about their first [assigned tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/).
3. The process appears in their [Tasks view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/), guiding them through the onboarding steps.
4. The process follows all standard tracking and completion rules.

### Benefits for adoption and training

Using this feature has several benefits:

- **Structured onboarding**: Ensures every new member gets the same initial process.
- **Self-guided training**: Lets new members complete training tasks at their own pace.
- **Reduced admin work**: Removes the need to manually launch onboarding processes.
- **Increased adoption**: Gets members using the platform right away.
- **Standardized knowledge**: Gives the same key information to all new members.
- **Measurable completion**: Easily track onboarding progress.

### Template design recommendations

Consider adding these to your auto-launch template:

- Welcome message and company info.
- Platform tutorial steps (linking to help articles).
- Introductions to key team members.
- Required training materials or [compliance](/products/pro/compliance/) documents.
- A final step to collect feedback.

### Additional considerations

- The template launches as soon as the new member activates their account.
- You can only set one template to auto-launch for new members.
- The name of the launched process will follow your organization's default process naming settings.
- Administrators can monitor completion using the [Tracker view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/).

This feature works well with other tools like [welcome snippets](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/) for a complete onboarding experience.
