## How can I automate new member onboarding in Tallyfy?

Tallyfy enables organizations to automatically launch specific [templates](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) for [new members](/products/pro/documenting/members/) when they join your organization. This powerful feature provides new members with a structured, consistent onboarding experience.

### What are the prerequisites for auto-launching templates?

Before setting up this feature, ensure you have:
- Administrator access to your Tallyfy organization
- An existing [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) specifically designed for new member onboarding
- The template must be available to all members (not restricted to certain roles or specific members in its settings)

### How do I set up auto-launch templates for new members?

<Steps>
1. Navigate to **Settings**.
2. Click the **Organization** tab.
3. Select **Customization**.
4. Locate the **Launch template for new members?** setting.
5. Use the dropdown menu to select the specific template you want to auto-launch.
6. Click **Save Changes** at the bottom of the page to confirm your selection.

</Steps>

### How does auto-launch work for new members?

Once configured, when a new member accepts their invitation and activates their account:

1. The chosen [template](/products/pro/documenting/templates/) automatically launches as a [process](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/) specifically assigned to that new member
2. They receive immediate email notifications about their first [assigned tasks](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/)
3. The process appears prominently in their [Tasks view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks-view/), providing clear guidance through the onboarding steps
4. The process follows all standard tracking and completion rules established in your organization

### What are the benefits of auto-launch for adoption and training?

Using this powerful feature provides several significant benefits:

- **Structured onboarding**: Ensures every new member receives exactly the same initial process experience
- **Self-guided training**: Allows new members to complete training tasks at their own optimal pace
- **Reduced administrative work**: Eliminates the need to manually launch onboarding processes for each new member
- **Increased platform adoption**: Gets members actively using the platform immediately upon joining
- **Standardized knowledge transfer**: Provides identical key information to all new members consistently, avoiding the [forgetting curve problem](/products/pro/tutorials/why-documentation-training-fails-forgetting-curve/) of traditional training
- **Measurable completion tracking**: Easily monitor and track onboarding progress across all new members

### What should I include in my auto-launch template design?

Consider including these essential elements in your auto-launch template:

- Welcome message and comprehensive company information
- Platform tutorial steps (with links to relevant help articles)
- Introductions to key team members and stakeholders
- Required training materials or [compliance](/products/pro/compliance/) documents
- A final step to collect valuable feedback about the onboarding experience

### What additional considerations should I keep in mind?

- The template launches immediately when the new member activates their account
- You can only configure one template to auto-launch for new members at a time
- The name of the launched process will follow your organization's default process naming conventions
- Administrators can monitor completion progress using the [Tracker view](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tracker-view/)

This feature integrates seamlessly with other tools like [welcome snippets](/products/pro/documenting/templates/snippets/) to create a comprehensive onboarding experience.
