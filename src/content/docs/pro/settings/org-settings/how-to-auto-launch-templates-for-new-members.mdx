## How to auto-launch templates for new members

Tallyfy offers a powerful onboarding feature that allows organizations to automatically launch specific templates for new members when they join. This feature enables a structured, self-driven onboarding experience right from the start.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up auto-launch templates for new members, ensure you have:
- Administrator access to your Tallyfy organization
- A template designed for onboarding new members
- The template should be accessible to all members

## Setting up auto-launch templates

To configure a template to automatically launch for new members:

1. Go to **Settings** in the top right corner of your screen
2. Click on the **Organization** tab
3. Select **Customization**
4. Look for the **Launch template for new members?** option
5. Use the dropdown to select the template you want to auto-launch for every new member
6. Save your changes

## How it works

Once configured, whenever a new member accepts their invitation and activates their account:

1. The selected template automatically launches as a process assigned to the new member
2. The new member receives email notifications about their assigned tasks
3. The process appears in their Tasks view, guiding them through the onboarding steps
4. The process follows all normal tracking and completion rules

## Benefits for adoption and training

This feature provides several key advantages:

- **Structured onboarding**: Every new member follows the same initial process, ensuring consistent onboarding
- **Self-driven training**: New members can complete training tasks at their own pace
- **Reduced administrative overhead**: No need to manually launch onboarding processes for each new hire
- **Increased adoption**: Members engage with the platform immediately through assigned tasks
- **Standardized knowledge transfer**: Ensure all new members receive the same critical information
- **Measurable completion**: Track which members have completed their onboarding process

## Template design recommendations

For effective new member onboarding, consider including these elements in your auto-launch template:

- Welcome message and company introduction
- Platform tutorial steps with links to help resources
- Introduction to key team members
- Required training materials and compliance documentation
- Feedback collection at the end of the process

## Additional considerations

- The template launches immediately when a new member activates their account
- Only one template can be designated as the auto-launch template for new members
- The process name will follow your organization's default naming convention
- Administrators can monitor template completion through the Tracker view

This feature works alongside other onboarding tools like welcome snippets to create a comprehensive onboarding experience.
