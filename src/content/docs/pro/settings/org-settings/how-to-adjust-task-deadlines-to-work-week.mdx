## How can I adjust task deadlines to match our work week?

Tallyfy administrators can configure organization-wide working days and hours to ensure realistic task scheduling aligned with actual business operations.

Tallyfy leverages these configurations to automatically adjust task [deadlines](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/), preventing deadline assignments during non-working periods including weekends or outside designated business hours. This scheduling ensures feasible deadline expectations across all organizational workflows.

### What steps configure working days and hours in Tallyfy?

<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings**.
2. Click **Organization**, then **Customization**.
3. Find the **Default work week** section. Check the boxes for your organization's standard work days (e.g., Monday to Friday).
4. Find the **Default working hours** section. Set the typical start and end times for your workday.

5. Scroll to the bottom and click **Save Changes**. Tallyfy will now use these settings when calculating relative deadlines.
</Steps>

:::note[How deadlines adjust]
If a calculated deadline falls on a non-working day (based on your settings) or outside your set working hours, Tallyfy **always pushes the deadline forward** to the *start of the next working period*. It never moves deadlines backward.
Example: A deadline calculated for Saturday moves to Monday morning (assuming Monday is set as a workday).
:::

### Why set working days and hours?

*   **Realistic deadlines**: Helps ensure tasks aren't due when people aren't typically working.
*   **Better planning**: Helps schedule workflows based on actual work time.
*   **Consistency**: Uses the same work schedule rules across your organization.

These settings are set once by an Administrator and apply to the entire organization.

### What deadline features does Tallyfy currently not support?

Tallyfy uses calendar days for all deadline calculations. While you can configure which days of the week are work days, Tallyfy does not currently support:

- **Country-specific holidays** (e.g., Labor Day in the US, Boxing Day in the UK)
- **Organization-specific holidays** (e.g., company closure days, annual shutdown periods)  
- **Person-specific unavailability** (e.g., individual vacation days, sick leave, personal time off)

All deadline calculations use the simple work week pattern you configure, without accounting for these exceptions.

:::note[Need these features?]
If your organization needs support for holidays, vacation tracking, or more complex deadline calculations, please [contact our support team](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/). Your feedback helps us prioritize features for our development roadmap.
