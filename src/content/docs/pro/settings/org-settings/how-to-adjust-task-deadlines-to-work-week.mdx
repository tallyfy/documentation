## Adjusting task deadlines to match your work week

Tallyfy can automatically shift [deadlines](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) so they never land on non-working days or outside business hours. An Administrator configures this once, and it applies organization-wide.

### Configuring working days and hours

<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Customization**.
2. Under **Default work week**, select your work week length - 7-day, 6-day (Mon-Sat), 5-day (Mon-Fri), or 4-day (Mon-Thu).
3. Under **Default Working Hours**, toggle each day between **All hours** (any time counts) or **Fixed hours** (set a start and end time with the slider).

4. Click **Save Changes**. Tallyfy will use these settings when calculating new deadlines.
</Steps>

:::note[How deadlines adjust]
If a calculated deadline falls on a non-working day or outside your set working hours, Tallyfy **always pushes the deadline forward** to the start of the next working period. It never moves deadlines backward.
Example: A deadline calculated for Saturday moves to Monday morning (assuming Monday is a workday).
:::

### What's not supported yet

Tallyfy's deadline calculations use the work week pattern you configure - but they don't account for:

- **Country-specific holidays** (e.g., Labor Day, Boxing Day)
- **Organization-specific holidays** (e.g., company closure days, annual shutdown)
- **Person-specific unavailability** (e.g., vacation days, sick leave)

:::tip[Public holiday data coming soon]
Tallyfy maintains a dataset of national holidays for 200+ countries at [tallyfy.com/national-holidays](https://tallyfy.com/national-holidays/). A future release will integrate this data into deadline calculations, so deadlines automatically skip national holidays in your country.

:::note[Need these features now?]
If your organization needs holiday-aware or vacation-aware deadline calculations, [contact our support team](/products/pro/miscellaneous/support/how-can-i-contact-tallyfys-support-team/). Your feedback helps prioritize our roadmap.
