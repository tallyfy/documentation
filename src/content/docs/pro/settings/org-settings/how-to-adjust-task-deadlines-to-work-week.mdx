## How to customize default working week and hours

Tallyfy allows administrators to configure default working days and hours at the organization level. These settings automatically calculate deadlines to ensure they don't fall on non-working days or outside business hours. Here's how to configure these settings:

1. Go to **Settings** in the top right corner of your screen.

2. Click on the **Organization** tab and then **Customization**.

3. Look for **Default work week** to select which days of the week are considered working days.

4. Under **Default working hours**, specify the start and end times for the standard workday.

5. Simply select the options that suit your organization's needs and Tallyfy will automatically update the deadlines for you.

## Why set default working week and hours?

Setting default working week and hours in Tallyfy provides several benefits:

- **Realistic deadlines**: Tasks will never be due on weekends, holidays, or outside of business hours
- **Better resource management**: Plan workflows based on actual working time
- **Improved task estimation**: Get more accurate forecasts of process completion
- **Organization-wide consistency**: These settings apply to the entire company, not individual users

All timing settings are established at the company level by administrators and apply uniformly to everyone in the organization, ensuring consistency across all workflows and processes.
