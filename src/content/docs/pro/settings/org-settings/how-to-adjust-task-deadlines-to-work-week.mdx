## Setting your organization's working days and hours

Administrators can define your organization's standard working days and hours in Tallyfy. Tallyfy uses these settings to automatically adjust task [deadlines](/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks/) so they don't fall during non-working times (like weekends or outside business hours).

### How to set working days and hours

<Steps>
1. Go to **Settings**.
2. Click **Organization**, then **Customization**.
3. Find the **Default work week** section. Check the boxes for your organization's standard work days (e.g., Monday to Friday).
4. Find the **Default working hours** section. Set the typical start and end times for your workday.

5. Scroll to the bottom and click **Save Changes**. Tallyfy will now use these settings when calculating relative deadlines.
</Steps>

:::note[How deadlines adjust]
If a calculated deadline falls on a non-working day (based on your settings) or outside your set working hours, Tallyfy **always pushes the deadline forward** to the *start of the next working period*. It never moves deadlines backward.
Example: A deadline calculated for Saturday moves to Monday morning (assuming Monday is set as a workday).
:::

### Why set working days and hours?

*   **Realistic deadlines**: Helps ensure tasks aren't due when people aren't typically working.
*   **Better planning**: Helps schedule workflows based on actual work time.
*   **Consistency**: Uses the same work schedule rules across your organization.

These settings are set once by an Administrator and apply to the entire organization.
