## How can I manage organization-wide settings in Tallyfy?

Tallyfy organization settings control how the platform works for your entire company. These settings affect all team members and determine company-wide policies and configurations.

Only **Administrator** users can access and modify these settings. From here, you manage core infrastructure like member permissions, billing, company branding, integrations, and administrative policies that shape how your team uses Tallyfy.
