## Common issues and solutions for removing organization members

Can't delete a member from your Tallyfy organization? The system requires specific conditions to be met before member removal. Here's how to resolve common blockers and handle edge cases.

### Quick diagnosis

Run through this checklist to identify your issue:

1. **Check member status** - Active, Disabled, or Invited?
2. **Check admin role** - Default Admin or Administrator badge?
3. **Count administrators** - How many total admins in your organization?
4. **Note exact error** - What message appears when attempting deletion?

### Common error messages

#### "Please disable the user before deletion"

Tallyfy uses a two-step deletion process for safety:
1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Organization** > **Members**
2. Click the member's name
3. Click **Deactivate Member**
4. Complete task reassignment
5. Then use the permanent deletion option

#### "Cannot modify the default administrator"

Transfer the default admin role first:
1. Click on a different administrator's profile
2. Select **Make Default Administrator**
3. Return to original member
4. Proceed with deactivation

If no other admins exist, promote a Standard member to Administrator first.

#### "Bot users cannot be disabled"

Bot accounts (like Tallyfy Bot) cannot be removed. They:
- Don't count toward billing
- Post automated comments
- Handle system tasks

#### "Cannot disable the last administrator"

Create another administrator first:
1. Select any Standard member
2. Click **Change Role** → **Administrator**
3. Then remove the original admin

### Special scenarios

#### Member shows as removed but still has access

1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Verify member status shows "Deactivated"
3. Check for active API tokens - revoke manually
4. If access persists after 30 minutes, contact support

#### Can't find deactivated member

Deactivated members are hidden by default:
1. Go to **Members** list
2. Use filter: **Show: All** or **Show: Deactivated**
3. Search by name or email

#### Bulk member removal

For multiple deletions via API:
- Process in batches of 10
- Allow 5 seconds between deletions
- Always disable before deleting
- Use the two-step process for each

### System behavior details

#### Email and name changes

When deleted, the system:
- Appends "(Deleted)" to last name
- Changes email to `{email}.deleted.{user_id}`
- Example: `john.doe@company.com` → `john.doe@company.com.deleted.12345`

This allows re-inviting the same person later without conflicts.

#### What happens to member data

**Immediately removed**:
- Login capability
- API access tokens
- Active sessions
- Password data

**Preserved for compliance**:
- Task completion history (name shows with "(Deleted)")
- Process participation records
- Comments and attachments
- Audit trail entries

#### Task reassignment

When no suitable member exists for reassignment:
- Tasks default to "Tallyfy Bot" (system user)
- Common in: last member deletion, bulk deletions, API deletions without reassignment

### API deletion

**Required sequence**:
```
1. DELETE /organizations/{org_id}/users/{user_id}/disable
2. Wait for 200 response
3. DELETE /organizations/{org_id}/users/{user_id}/delete
```

**With reassignment**:
```
DELETE /organizations/{org_id}/users/{user_id}?with_reassignment=true&to={new_user_id}
```

**Rate limits**: Maximum 10 deletions per minute, 429 error if exceeded

### Complex edge cases

#### Organization with single member
- Cannot delete last member
- Contact support for organization closure

#### Circular dependencies
Admin A backs up Admin B, Admin B backs up Admin A:
- Add third admin temporarily to break cycle

#### Template with 1000+ processes
- May timeout during deletion
- Use batch reassignment via API
- Process in groups of 100

### Recovery options

**Accidental deletion**:
Contact support immediately with:
- Organization name
- Member email
- Deletion date

Support may restore recent deletions. For older deletions, send new invitation.

### When to contact support

Contact support when:
- Errors don't match those listed
- Deletion affects 50+ processes
- Server errors (500-series) appear
- Deletion pending over 1 hour

**Provide**: Organization name, member email, exact error, screenshot

### Prevention tips

- Maintain at least 2 administrators
- Document default administrator
- Test deletion in sandbox first
- Use consistent offboarding procedures
