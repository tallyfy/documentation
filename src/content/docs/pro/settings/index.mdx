## How are Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> settings organized?

Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> settings are systematically organized into two distinct main areas:

### Why are proper settings crucial for effective workflow management?

Proper settings configuration significantly enhances both individual productivity and overall team efficiency in Tallyfy<sup>®</sup>. Strategic configuration ensures optimal platform performance tailored to your specific organizational requirements.

Well-configured settings ensure:
- Notifications reach the appropriate team members at the right time
- Security protocols effectively protect your sensitive organizational data
- The platform operates seamlessly for your team's unique workflow needs

Investing time to understand and properly adjust these settings prevents operational issues and allows you to fully customize the Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> experience for your organization's success.

*   **Personal Settings**: These settings affect only your individual user experience. Personal settings include your profile picture, password preferences, email notification options, and language selection. Any [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) can modify their own personal settings independently

*   **Organization Settings**: These settings affect everyone in your organization's Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> account. Organization settings encompass billing management, member roles, security protocols, integrations, and general company-wide preferences. Only users with the **Administrator** role can modify most organization-wide settings

Explore the comprehensive sections below to understand each type of Tallyfy setting and configure your platform for optimal workflow management success.
