## Settings work at organization or personal level

Settings within Tallyfy are divided into two main areas:

- **Personal Settings** relate to the member signed in, and specifically apply to that individual.
- **Organizational Settings** relate to settings that apply to the entire organization on Tallyfy.

Remember that you may not be able to see a lot of settings, especially _Organizational Settings_ unless you're in the Administrator role.
