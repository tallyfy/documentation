## Settings organization

Tallyfy settings are organized into two main areas:

*   **Personal Settings**: These settings affect only your individual user experience. Personal settings include your profile picture, password preferences, email notification options, and language selection. Any [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) can modify their own personal settings independently

*   **Organization Settings**: These settings affect everyone in your organization's Tallyfy account. Organization settings encompass billing management, member roles, security protocols, integrations, and general company-wide preferences. Only users with the **Administrator** role can modify most organization-wide settings
