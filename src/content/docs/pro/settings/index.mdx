## Understanding Tallyfy's settings structure

Tallyfy settings are divided into two main areas:

### Why settings are important

Proper settings configuration is essential for both individual productivity and organizational efficiency in Tallyfy. Well-configured settings ensure that notifications reach the right people, security measures protect your data, and the platform behaves according to your team's specific needs. Taking time to understand and adjust these settings prevents frustration, improves adoption, and enables you to customize the Tallyfy experience to align with your organization's processes and culture.

*   **Personal Settings**: These affect *only you*. They include your profile picture, password, email notifications, and language preference. Any [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) can change their own personal settings.

*   **Organization Settings**: These affect *everyone* in your organization's Tallyfy account. They cover billing, member roles, security, integrations, and general company preferences. Only users with the **Administrator** role can change most organization settings.

Explore the sections below to learn more about each type of setting.
