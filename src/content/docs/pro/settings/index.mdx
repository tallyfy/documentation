## How settings are organized

Tallyfy settings split into two areas:

*   **Personal Settings** - affect only you. This covers your profile picture, password, email notifications, and language. Any [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) can change their own personal settings.

*   **Organization Settings** - affect everyone in your Tallyfy account. This covers billing, member roles, SSO/SAML, custom SMTP, branding, integrations, and company-wide preferences. Only **Administrators** can change these.

## What to configure next

Pick the area that matches your role:

- **Team members** - start with [Personal settings](/products/pro/settings/personal-settings/) to set up notifications and preferences
- **Administrators** - review [Organization settings](/products/pro/settings/org-settings/) to configure options that affect all users
- **Account managers** - check [Billing settings](/products/pro/settings/billing/) to manage your Tallyfy subscription and costs
