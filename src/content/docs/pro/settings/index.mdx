## Understand Tallyfy's settings structure

Tallyfy organizes settings into two distinct categories based on their scope of impact:

* **Personal Settings**: User-specific configurations that affect only the currently signed-in [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/)
* **Organization Settings**: Global configurations that apply to all users within the organization

Access to Organization Settings is primarily restricted to users with Administrator privileges. Regular users may have limited visibility of these global settings depending on their assigned [role permissions](/products/pro/documenting/members/).
