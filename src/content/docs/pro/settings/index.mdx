## Understanding Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> settings structure

Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> settings are divided into two main areas:

### Why settings are important

Good settings configuration helps both individual productivity and team efficiency in Tallyfy<sup>®</sup>. Well-set settings make sure notifications reach the right people, security protects your data, and the platform works for your team's needs. Taking time to understand and adjust these settings prevents problems and lets you customize the Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> experience for your organization.

*   **Personal Settings**: These affect *only you*. They include your profile picture, password, email notifications, and language preference. Any [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) can change their own personal settings.

*   **Organization Settings**: These affect *everyone* in your organization's Tallyfy<sup>®</sup> account. They cover billing, member roles, security, integrations, and general company preferences. Only users with the **Administrator** role can change most organization settings.

Explore the sections below to learn more about each type of setting.
