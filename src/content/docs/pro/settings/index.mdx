## Understanding Tallyfy's settings structure

Tallyfy settings are divided into two main areas:

*   **Personal Settings**: These affect *only you*. They include your profile picture, password, email notifications, and language preference. Any [member](/products/pro/documenting/members/) can change their own personal settings.

*   **Organization Settings**: These affect *everyone* in your organization's Tallyfy account. They cover billing, member roles, security, integrations, and general company preferences. Only users with the **Administrator** role can change most organization settings.
