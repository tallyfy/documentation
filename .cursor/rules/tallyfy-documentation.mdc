## 3. PLATFORM & TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

### 3.1 Documentation Platform
- **Platform**: Astro Starlight
- **Format**: Markdown files (.mdx)
- **Editing**: All edits must be in markdown using standard syntax

### 3.2 Article Structure Rules
1. **Headers** (DO NOT EDIT except for new articles):
   ```yaml
   ---
   id: c15bf2be31c3a7fbded5d13fce7aaab9
   sidebar:
     order: 15
   snippet: [description]
   title: [Article title in sentence case]
   ---
   ```
   - New articles must use ID: `0000000000000000000000000000000000`

2. **Component Imports**:
   - When using special components (Steps, CardGrid, LinkTitleCard), add import statements immediately after the frontmatter header
   - Example: `import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';`
   - Import must appear before any article content

3. **Content Hierarchy**:
   - Start with H2 (`##`), never H1
   - Don't skip heading levels (H2 → H3 → H4)
   - All headings use sentence case (lowercase except proper nouns)

4. **Footers** (DO NOT EDIT except for new articles):
   - Must appear at article end
   - Contains related articles using CardGrid components

### 3.3 Content Creation Rules
- Only create new articles when absolutely necessary
- When handling GitHub tickets, evaluate if documentation changes are needed
- Include prerequisites section for procedural articles
- Follow consistent structure based on content type (concept/task/reference/troubleshooting)

## 4. WRITING STYLE GUIDELINES

### 4.1 Voice & Tone
- **Direct & Clear**: Write as if explaining to a colleague
- **Simple Language**: Must be understandable by a 20 year old
- **Conversational**: Use "you", contractions ("you're", "can't")
- **Professional**: Friendly but not overly casual
- **No fluff**: Avoid humor, platitudes, metaphors, clichés

### 4.2 Language Rules
- **Active voice**: "The system sends an email" not "An email is sent by the system"
- **Present tense**: For instructions and descriptions
- **American English**: Spelling and grammar
- **Global audience**: No idioms, cultural references, or colloquialisms
- **Specific nouns**: Replace "it", "this", "the platform" with "Tallyfy", "the template", etc.
- **Simple sentences**: Under 25 words, one idea per sentence
- **Clear facts**: Use subject-verb-object structure

### 4.3 Words to Avoid
- Starting sentences with "By"
- Clichés like "In today's world", "landscape" references
- Overused adjectives: "crucial", "ideal", "key", "robust", "enhance" (without explanation)
- Vague pronouns without clear antecedents
- Complex sentence structures with multiple clauses

## 5. CONTENT ORGANIZATION

### 5.1 Document Structure
- **Focused content**: One main topic per article
- **Clear sections**: Descriptive headings and subheadings
- **Logical flow**: Include transitions between sections
- **Front-loaded information**: Key points first
- **Paragraph guidelines**:
  - 3-5 sentences maximum
  - 50-120 words per paragraph
  - One idea per paragraph

### 5.2 Content Types
- **Conceptual**: What and why
- **Procedural**: How-to instructions
- **Reference**: Technical details
- **Troubleshooting**: Problem/cause/solution format

### 5.3 Emphasis & Highlighting
- Limit to 1-3 emphasized items per page
- Use **Note:** prefix for important tips
- Convert key insights to list items for scannability

## 6. FORMATTING CONVENTIONS

### 6.1 Text Formatting
- **Bold** (`**text**`): UI elements (buttons, menus, fields, options)
- *Italics* (`*text*`): New terms with definitions, placeholders
- `Code` (`` `text` ``): Code snippets, commands, literal text
- No quotes for UI elements
- No underlining (reserved for links)

### 6.2 Markdown Elements
- **Headings**: Start with `##` (H2), maintain hierarchy
- **Lists**: 
  - Bullets (`-` or `*`) for unordered items
  - Numbers for sequential steps
  - Indent 4 spaces for sub-items
- **Callouts**: Use sparingly
  ```markdown
  :::note[Title]
  Content
  :::
  ```
- **Videos**: 
  ```html
  <lite-vimeo videoid="905736219"></lite-vimeo>
  ```

### 6.3 Special Components
- **Steps Component**: Only for product instructions
  ```markdown
  <Steps>
  1. Single-level hierarchy only
  2. Images must be inside list items
  </Steps>
  ```
  - Example with image:
  ```markdown
  1. **Step 1:** Configure your settings.
     
     ![Screenshot description](mdc:image-url.png)
  ```

## 7. INSTRUCTIONAL CONTENT

- Mark optional steps: "*(Optional)* If you want to..."
- Add verification steps
- Include prerequisites at beginning
- State expected outcomes

### 7.2 Images & Screenshots

### 7.3 Examples & Code
- Use realistic scenarios (e.g., "ACME Corp")
- Include comments in code samples
- Ensure valid, properly formatted code
- Show complete functionality
- Include expected outputs
- Use appropriate markdown syntax for code blocks

## 8. LINKING & REFERENCES

### 8.1 Internal Links
- **Format**: Absolute paths without .mdx extension
- **Example**: `/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/`
- **Public URLs**: Base URL is `https://tallyfy.com/products/`
- **Core Concepts Linking Pattern**: 
  - Link sparingly to core concepts from section 2.3 when first mentioned in article body
  - Format: `[templates](mdc:products/pro/documenting/templates)`, `[tasks](mdc:products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks)`
  - Only link when it adds value for understanding the current topic
- Link only first occurrence in a section
- Use descriptive anchor text (not "click here")
- Add "See also" sections when helpful

### 8.2 Linking Best Practices
- Sparingly link to core concepts when helpful
- Verify all links are valid

- Proper heading structure for navigation
- State required prior knowledge explicitly

## 10. SEO & AI OPTIMIZATION

### 10.1 Content Structure for AI
- Small, focused semantic chunks

- Consistent terminology with natural synonyms
- Preserve user experience while optimizing

## 11. TROUBLESHOOTING CONTENT

### 11.1 Format
- Clear problem/cause/solution structure
- Use tables or lists for multiple issues
- Include exact error messages in `code` format
- Specific solutions (not "check your settings")
- Preventative measures when applicable
- Link to support resources for complex issues

## 12. CONTENT MAINTENANCE

### 12.1 Best Practices
