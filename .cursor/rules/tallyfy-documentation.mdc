## 3. PLATFORM & TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

### 3.1 Documentation Platform
- **Platform**: Astro Starlight
- **Format**: Markdown files (.mdx)
- **Editing**: All edits must be in markdown using standard syntax

### 3.2 Article Structure Rules
1. **Headers** (DO NOT EDIT except for new articles):
   ```yaml
   ---
   id: c15bf2be31c3a7fbded5d13fce7aaab9
   sidebar:
     order: 15
   snippet: [description]
   title: [Article title in sentence case]
   ---
   ```
   - New articles must use ID: `0000000000000000000000000000000000`

2. **Component Imports**:
   - When using special components (Steps, CardGrid, LinkTitleCard), add import statements immediately after the frontmatter header
   - Example: `import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';`
   - Import must appear before any article content

3. **Content Hierarchy**:
   - Start with H2 (`##`), never H1
   - Don't skip heading levels (H2 → H3 → H4)
   - All headings use sentence case (lowercase except proper nouns)

4. **Footers** (DO NOT EDIT except for new articles):
   - Must appear at article end
   - Contains related articles using CardGrid components

### 3.3 Content Creation Rules
- Only create new articles when absolutely necessary
- When handling GitHub tickets, evaluate if documentation changes are needed
- Include prerequisites section for procedural articles
- Follow consistent structure based on content type (concept/task/reference/troubleshooting)
- **Directory structure requirement**: When creating new folders, always include an `index.mdx` file as the landing page for that directory to prevent build errors and provide proper navigation

## 4. WRITING STYLE GUIDELINES

### 4.1 Voice & Tone
- **Direct & Clear**: Write as if explaining to a colleague
- **Simple Language**: Must be understandable by a 20 year old
- **Conversational**: Use "you", contractions ("you're", "can't")
- **Professional**: Friendly but not overly casual
- **No fluff**: Avoid humor, platitudes, metaphors, clichés

### 4.2 Language Rules
- **Active voice**: "The system sends an email" not "An email is sent by the system"
- **Present tense**: For instructions and descriptions
- **American English**: Spelling and grammar
- **Global audience**: No idioms, cultural references, or colloquialisms
- **Specific nouns**: Replace "it", "this", "the platform" with "Tallyfy", "the template", etc.
- **Simple sentences**: Under 25 words, one idea per sentence
- **Clear facts**: Use subject-verb-object structure
- **Varied sentence rhythm**: Mix short and long sentences to maintain reader engagement and avoid monotonous flow
  - Bad: "We launched a conversational AI feature. The feature lets users ask questions. Users get responses based on activity. The system searches help articles. It ranks the relevant ones. A language model generates answers."
  - Good: "We just launched a conversational AI feature. It answers user questions in plain language, using context from the current session. The system searches help articles, scores them with custom ranking, and generates responses in under 300ms."
  - **Burstiness pattern**: Aim for natural variation—follow a complex 30-word sentence with a punchy 5-word one. Then maybe a medium 15-word sentence. This mimics natural speech patterns.
  - **Rhythm markers**: Every 3-4 paragraphs, include one notably short sentence (under 8 words) for emphasis. "That's it." "Problem solved." "Here's how."
- **Right subject choice**: Align sentence subject with the main topic
  - Bad: "Readers are better guided when the subject matches the main idea"
  - Good: "Choosing the right subject keeps the writing clear and focused"
- **Subject-verb proximity**: Place subject and verb close together, ideally at sentence beginning
- **Concrete specificity**: Always provide evidence, examples, and specifics
  - Bad: "Some experts say this feature improves productivity"
  - Good: "Three customer case studies show this feature reduces task completion time by 40%"
- **Clear pronoun references**: When using "this", "that", "these", "those" - ensure the referenced noun is in the same sentence or immediately before
  - Bad: "Click the button. This creates a new process." (What creates it - the click or the button?)
  - Good: "Click the **Create** button. This action starts a new process."

### 4.3 Words to Avoid
- Starting sentences with "By"
- Clichés like "In today's world", "landscape" references
- Overused adjectives: "crucial", "ideal", "key", "robust", "enhance" (without explanation)
- Vague pronouns without clear antecedents
- Complex sentence structures with multiple clauses
- **Empty summary sentences**: Avoid ending paragraphs with vague conclusions that add no value
  - Bad: "By following these steps, we achieve better performance."
  - Bad: "By internalizing these principles, you can cut through the noise."
  - Good: End with concrete next steps or specific insights
- **Made-up technical terms**: Don't invent terms that don't exist in the field
  - Bad: "We added retrieval grounding" (if this isn't an established term)
  - Good: "We added a retrieval step to verify facts against source documents"
- **Fluency without substance**: Avoid sentences that sound correct but explain nothing
  - Bad: "LLMs use attention mechanisms to generate contextually appropriate responses"
  - Good: "LLMs analyze relationships between words to predict what comes next, similar to how you might complete a friend's sentence"

### 4.4 Acceptable Writing Patterns (Often Mistaken as "AI-Like")

These patterns are effective when used intentionally with substance:

- **Intentional repetition for clarity**: Repeating complex concepts in simpler terms
  - Good: "Vector databases store embeddings - mathematical representations that capture meaning. In other words, vector databases help find results that are 'close' in meaning, not just exact text matches."
- **Signposting phrases**: Use when followed by valuable content
  - Good: "Essentially, instead of classifying the document as a whole, we classify each section independently."
  - Only use when the following content genuinely clarifies or adds value
- **Parallel structure**: For organizing related ideas
  - Good: "The system scales across inputs, stays responsive under load, and returns consistent results even with noisy prompts."
- **Declarative openings**: Bold claims work when backed by evidence
  - Good: "LLM evaluations are hard to get right. Many rely on user-defined gold labels or vague accuracy metrics, which fail for subjective or multi-step tasks."
- **Hyphens for rhythm and clarity**: Use spaced hyphens for emphasis and natural speech patterns
  - Good: "Templates define your process - think of them as reusable blueprints - while processes are the actual running instances."
  - **Important**: Always use regular hyphens with spaces ( - ) not em-dashes (—) or en-dashes (–)
  - Format: `space hyphen space` like "this - not this—or this–"
- **Strategic fragments for emphasis**: Occasionally use sentence fragments for impact (use EXTREMELY sparingly)
  - Good: "Want to automate task assignments? Simple. Just configure the automation rules in your template."
  - Good: "The result? A 40% reduction in process completion time."
  - Only use 1-2 fragments per article maximum, and only when it genuinely adds emphasis
- **Conversational asides with parentheses**: Add brief, helpful context in a natural voice
  - Good: "You can assign tasks to job titles (not just specific people), which means new team members automatically get the right work."
  - Good: "The API returns results in JSON format (yes, it's that straightforward)."
  - Keep asides brief and genuinely helpful—never forced
- **Personal phrasing within professional bounds**: Use specific, experience-based language
  - Good: "After helping 500+ companies implement workflows, we've found that simple templates work best."
  - Good: "You'll notice the difference immediately—tasks that took hours now take minutes."
  - Ground claims in concrete experience or data

## 5. CONTENT ORGANIZATION

### 5.1 Document Structure
- **Focused content**: One main topic per article
- **Clear sections**: Descriptive headings and subheadings
- **Logical flow**: Include transitions between sections
- **Front-loaded information**: Key points first
- **Paragraph guidelines**:
  - 3-5 sentences maximum
  - 50-120 words per paragraph
  - One idea per paragraph
- **High information density**: Every sentence must provide value
  - Bad: "As someone who manages workflows, you've probably noticed inefficiencies. This post guides you through optimization. We'll cover the pitfalls that make processes feel slow."
  - Good: "Manual task assignment wastes 2 hours daily for most managers. Here's how to automate assignments based on workload and expertise."
- **Strategic bullet points**: Use lists only when items are truly parallel and independent
  - Overuse of nested bullets makes content harder to scan
  - When ideas connect or need context, use paragraphs instead
  - Reserve bullets for truly independent items like feature lists or prerequisites

### 5.2 Content Types
- **Conceptual**: What and why
- **Procedural**: How-to instructions
- **Reference**: Technical details
- **Troubleshooting**: Problem/cause/solution format

### 5.3 Emphasis & Highlighting
- Limit to 1-3 emphasized items per page
- Use **Note:** prefix for important tips
- Convert key insights to list items for scannability

## 6. FORMATTING CONVENTIONS

### 6.1 Text Formatting
- **Bold** (`**text**`): UI elements (buttons, menus, fields, options)
- *Italics* (`*text*`): New terms with definitions, placeholders
- `Code` (`` `text` ``): Code snippets, commands, literal text
- No quotes for UI elements
- No underlining (reserved for links)

### 6.2 Markdown Elements
- **Headings**: Start with `##` (H2), maintain hierarchy
- **Lists**: 
  - Bullets (`-` or `*`) for unordered items
  - Numbers for sequential steps
  - Indent 4 spaces for sub-items
- **Callouts**: Use sparingly
  ```markdown
  :::note[Title]
  Content
  :::
  ```
- **Videos**: 
  ```html
  <lite-vimeo videoid="905736219"></lite-vimeo>
  ```

### 6.3 Special Components
- **Steps Component**: Only for product instructions
  ```markdown
  <Steps>
  1. Single-level hierarchy only
  2. Images must be inside list items
  </Steps>
  ```
  - Example with image:
  ```markdown
  1. **Step 1:** Configure your settings.
     
     ![Screenshot description](mdc:image-url.png)
  ```

## 7. INSTRUCTIONAL CONTENT

### 7.1 Writing Procedures
- Start with action verbs: "Click **Submit**"
- One action per step
- Include context: "In the **Dashboard**, click..."
- Mark optional steps: "*(Optional)* If you want to..."
- Add verification steps
- Include prerequisites at beginning
- State expected outcomes

### 7.2 Images & Screenshots
- **When to use**: Only when adding clarity
- **Requirements**:
  - Descriptive alt text
  - Brief introduction before image
  - Annotations (arrows, circles) for key elements
  - High quality, legible text
  - Cropped to relevant portions
- **Alt text format**: `![Tallyfy dashboard showing workflow](mdc:image.png)`

### 7.3 Examples & Code
- Use realistic scenarios (e.g., "ACME Corp")
- Include comments in code samples
- Ensure valid, properly formatted code
- Show complete functionality
- Include expected outputs
- Use appropriate markdown syntax for code blocks

### 7.4 Advanced Writing Techniques

- **SWBST Pattern** (Somebody Wanted But So Then): Use for explaining decisions or system evolution
  - Somebody: The actor (user, team, system)
  - Wanted: The goal
  - But: The obstacle
  - So: The response
  - Then: The outcome
  - Example: "We used GPT-4 for summarization. We wanted fluent answers, but it hallucinated facts. So we added a retrieval step. Then we re-ranked outputs based on citation accuracy."
- **Contribution commensurate with length**: Ensure value matches article length
  - A 500-word article must provide 500 words of genuine insight
  - Cut content that doesn't directly serve the reader's goal
  - Ask: "Will the reader feel their time was well spent?"

## 8. LINKING & REFERENCES

### 8.1 Internal Links
- **Format**: Absolute paths without .mdx extension
- **Example**: `/products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/processes/`
- **Public URLs**: Base URL is `https://tallyfy.com/products/`
- **Core Concepts Linking Pattern**: 
  - Link sparingly to core concepts from section 2.3 when first mentioned in article body
  - Format: `[templates](mdc:products/pro/documenting/templates)`, `[tasks](mdc:products/pro/tracking-and-tasks/tasks)`
  - Only link when it adds value for understanding the current topic
- Link only first occurrence in a section
- Use descriptive anchor text (not "click here")
- Add "See also" sections when helpful

### 8.2 Linking Best Practices
- Sparingly link to core concepts when helpful
- Verify all links are valid
- Don't over-link (distracts readers)
- Consider if external links should open in new tab

## 9. ACCESSIBILITY & INCLUSIVITY

### 9.1 Inclusive Language
- Gender-neutral pronouns ("they" not "he/she")
- No ableist or biased terms
- Diverse examples and scenarios
- No exclusionary or discriminatory language

### 9.2 Accessibility Requirements
- Don't rely on sensory characteristics ("click **Start**" not "click the green button")
- Always include image alt text
- Standard capitalization for screen readers
- Proper heading structure for navigation
- State required prior knowledge explicitly

## 10. SEO & AI OPTIMIZATION

### 10.1 Content Structure for AI
- Small, focused semantic chunks
- Descriptive headings (consider questions)
- Standalone paragraphs and sections
- Front-loaded key information
- Clear subject-verb-object sentences

### 10.2 Optimization Techniques
- Natural keyword variations (e.g., "workflows" and "processes")
- Parenthetical explanations for acronyms: "Service-Level Agreement (SLA)"
- Structured formats (lists, tables, steps) for easy parsing
- Consistent terminology with natural synonyms
- Preserve user experience while optimizing

## 11. TROUBLESHOOTING CONTENT

### 11.1 Format
- Clear problem/cause/solution structure
- Use tables or lists for multiple issues
- Include exact error messages in `code` format
- Specific solutions (not "check your settings")
- Preventative measures when applicable
- Link to support resources for complex issues

## 12. CONTENT MAINTENANCE

### 12.1 Best Practices
- Regular testing of instructions
- Update screenshots when UI changes
- Maintain consistent terminology
- Update promptly when features change
- Review with accessibility in mind
- Consider both human readers and AI systems
