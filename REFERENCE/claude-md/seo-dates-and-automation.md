# SEO and AI optimization, last updated dates and the automation philosophy

## SEO & AI OPTIMIZATION

### Technical SEO Writing Rules

**URL-Friendly Titles**:
- Use descriptive, keyword-rich titles that work as URLs
- Example: "How to Assign Tasks in Tallyfy" → `/how-to-assign-tasks/`
- Avoid special characters, numbers, or dates in titles
- Keep titles under 60 characters

**Search-Optimized Content Patterns**:

**HowTo Content Pattern**:
```markdown
## How to [specific action]

**Time required**: 5 minutes
**Difficulty**: Easy
**Prerequisites**: Administrator or Standard user role

### Steps

1. **Navigate to Templates**: Click the **Templates** tab in the main menu
2. **Create New Template**: Select **Create New** button
3. **Configure Settings**: Add your process steps and automations
```

**FAQ Content Pattern**:
```markdown
## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I assign tasks to multiple people?

Yes, use the group assignment feature. Click **Assign** and select **Group Assignment** to assign the same task to multiple team members.

### How do I track task progress?

The tracker view provides real-time visibility. Navigate to **Tracker** to see all running processes and their current status.
```

### Content Structure for AI
- Small, focused semantic chunks (300-500 words per section)
- Descriptive headings formatted as questions when appropriate
- Standalone paragraphs that make sense out of context
- Front-loaded key information in first 50 words
- Clear subject-verb-object sentences
- Include specific numbers and data points when available

### Optimization Techniques
- Natural keyword variations (e.g., "workflows", "processes", "procedures")
- Entity mentions: Always use "Tallyfy" not "the platform" or "our tool"
- Parenthetical explanations for acronyms: "Service-Level Agreement (SLA)"
- Structured formats (lists, tables, steps) for easy parsing
- Semantic HTML: proper use of `<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`
- Internal linking with descriptive anchor text (3-5 per article)


### LLM-Specific Optimization Patterns

**Conversational Markers for AI Understanding**:
- Start procedural content with "To [achieve goal]:" followed by steps
- Use "For example:" to introduce concrete scenarios
- Include "Note:" for important contextual information
- Add "Prerequisites:" sections for complex procedures

**Citation-Worthy Content Structure**:
- **Claim + Evidence**: "Tallyfy automates task assignment based on workload and availability"
- **Problem + Solution**: "If tasks are getting stuck, enable automatic reassignment with an automation"
- **Question + Direct Answer**: Use H2/H3 headings as questions when appropriate

**Entity Reinforcement**:
- Mention "Tallyfy" 3-5 times per article naturally
- Connect features to Tallyfy explicitly: "Tallyfy's automation engine" not just "the automation engine"
- Build topic clusters around core entities (templates, processes, automations)

**Semantic Completeness**:
- Define terms on first use: "Templates (reusable process blueprints) help standardize workflows"
- Include related concepts: When discussing tasks, mention assignments, deadlines, and notifications
- Create mini-glossaries for complex topics

**Required Context Clusters**:
When discussing any feature, include ALL related concepts:

*Task Discussion Must Include*:
- Assignment methods (individual, group, job title)
- Due dates and deadline management
- Form fields and data collection
- Comments and collaboration features
- Dependencies and prerequisites
- Completion criteria and validation

*Template Discussion Must Include*:
- Creation and configuration process
- Step/task setup
- Assignment and routing logic
- Automation options
- Launch procedures
- Version control and updates

**LLM Selection Triggers**:
- Use specific numbers: "5 steps", "10-minute setup", "3 approval levels"
- Include comparison phrases: "Unlike spreadsheets, Tallyfy provides..."
- Add outcome statements: "This results in...", "The benefit is..."
- Use if-then constructions: "If you need X, then Tallyfy's Y feature..."
- Problem-solution pairs: "Can't track progress? Tallyfy's dashboard shows real-time status"
- Feature-benefit connection: "Automatic reminders ensure deadlines are never missed"
- Use case specificity: "For HR onboarding, Tallyfy provides complete checklists"

## LAST UPDATED DATES SYSTEM

### Overview
Every documentation page displays its last modification date, automatically maintained through Git history. This provides transparency about content freshness for users and improves SEO.

### How It Works
1. **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`documentation-pipeline.yml`):
   - Runs on every commit to BOTH `staging` and `main` branches (no auto-promotion between them)
   - `staging` pushes sync content to `support-docs` `staging` branch → CF Pages preview → `staging.tallyfy.com/products/*`
   - `main` pushes sync content to `support-docs` `production` branch → CF Pages production → `tallyfy.com/products/*`
   - Executes `update-last-modified.py` script **on `staging` pushes only**; the `main` pipeline skips this step and inherits the staging-frozen value via merge (see tallyfy/documentation#56)
   - Extracts last modified date from Git history for each MDX file
   - Updates `lastUpdated` field in frontmatter

2. **Date Format**:
   - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD` (e.g., `2025-08-15`)
   - Stored in frontmatter: `lastUpdated: 2025-08-15`
   - Displayed as: "Last updated: August 15, 2025"

3. **Automation Benefits**:
   - No manual date maintenance required
   - Accurate dates based on actual Git commits
   - Consistent across all 600+ documentation files
   - Automatically synced to rendering repository

### Script Usage
```bash
# Update all lastUpdated dates from Git history
python scripts/update-last-modified.py --dir=src/content/docs

# The script will:
# - Process all .mdx files recursively
# - Extract last commit date for each file
# - Update or add lastUpdated field in frontmatter
# - Skip files already up-to-date
# - Report summary of changes
```

### Important Notes
- Requires full Git history (`fetch-depth: 0` in GitHub Actions)
- Dates reflect when content was last modified in Git
- If a file has no Git history, it won't get a lastUpdated date
- The rendering repository (/support-docs) uses these dates from frontmatter


## CLAUDE CODE AUTOMATION PHILOSOPHY

### Overview

This codebase supports automated documentation workflows using Claude Code's non-interactive mode. Break large documentation tasks into atomic units that can be executed sequentially via command line, enabling systematic content updates without manual intervention.

### Non-Interactive Command Pattern

Execute specific documentation tasks using:
```bash
claude -p "YOUR_PROMPT_HERE" --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

This command runs Claude with a specific prompt, completes the task, and exits - perfect for scripting and automation.

### Task Queue Pattern

For large documentation projects, use a file-based task queue:

1. **Create prompt files**: Each `.prompt` file contains one specific documentation task
2. **Process sequentially**: Scripts read and execute prompts one by one
3. **Track progress**: Completed tasks are deleted or moved, making workflows resumable

Example directory structure:
```
doc_automation_queue/
├── 001_analyze_missing_docs.prompt
├── 002_create_api_reference.prompt
├── 003_update_changelog.prompt
└── completed/
```

### Example Automation Scripts

#### 1. Bulk Documentation Updates
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# process_doc_queue.sh

for prompt_file in doc_automation_queue/*.prompt; do
    echo "Processing: $prompt_file"
    
    # Read prompt and execute
    prompt=$(cat "$prompt_file")
    claude -p "$prompt" --dangerously-skip-permissions
    
    # Move completed
    mv "$prompt_file" doc_automation_queue/completed/
done
```

#### 2. Generate Missing Documentation
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# generate_missing_docs.py

import subprocess
import os
from pathlib import Path

def generate_doc_for_feature(feature_path):
    prompt = f"""
    Create documentation for {feature_path} following the style guidelines in CLAUDE.md.
    Include: overview, prerequisites, step-by-step instructions, and troubleshooting.
    """
    
    subprocess.run([
        "claude", "-p", prompt, "--dangerously-skip-permissions"
    ])

# Process all features needing documentation
features = Path("src/content/docs/pro").glob("**/*.mdx")
for feature in features:
    if "TODO" in feature.read_text():
        generate_doc_for_feature(feature)
```
