### Contribution Guidelines

#### What We Accept

‚úÖ **We welcome:**
- Typo and grammar fixes
- Clarifications to existing content
- Better examples or use cases
- Corrections to outdated information
- Improvements to formatting and readability

‚ùå **Please avoid:**
- Major structural changes without discussion
- Adding new features or product documentation (contact us first)
- Promotional content or external links
- Changes to technical architecture files

#### Style Guidelines

- Use clear, simple language
- Write in present tense
- Keep sentences concise
- Follow American English spelling
- Bold UI elements using `**text**`

#### Using Mermaid Diagrams

We use Mermaid diagrams to visualize complex workflows, API interactions, and system architectures. Mermaid enables you to create diagrams using simple text-based syntax.

> **Important**: Only use diagrams where they add clear value. Simple processes with 3 steps or fewer usually don't need diagrams.

##### Quick Example

Add a diagram to any documentation page using a code block with the `mermaid` language identifier:

````markdown
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start([User Action]) --> Process[Process Step]
    Process --> Complete([Complete])
    
    style Start fill:#E8F4FF
    style Complete fill:#D4EDDA
```
````

##### When to Use Diagrams

‚úÖ **Good candidates for diagrams:**
- Multi-step processes where sequence matters
- Conditional logic with multiple branches
- System interactions between Tallyfy and external services
- User-system collaboration (e.g., SSO setup)
- Complex automation rules with multiple conditions
- API request/response flows with authentication
- Webhook event flows with retry logic

‚ùå **Avoid diagrams for:**
- Simple linear processes (3 steps or fewer)
- Single API calls without complex flow
- Basic CRUD operations
- Content better explained with text
- UI navigation (use screenshots instead)

##### Diagram Types by Documentation Area

| Documentation Area | Diagram Type | Key Elements |
|---|---|---|
| **API Documentation** | `sequenceDiagram` | Request/response, authentication, error handling |
| **Webhook Documentation** | `sequenceDiagram` | Event triggers, retry logic, queue processing |
| **Process Workflows** | `flowchart TD` | Decision nodes, branches, outcomes |
| **Automation Logic** | `flowchart TD` | Sequential rules, AND/OR logic, actions |
| **SSO/Authentication** | `sequenceDiagram` | User + admin actions, token flow |
| **System Architecture** | `graph LR` | Components, data flow, connections |

##### Real-World Examples

###### Automation Rule Evaluation (Reflects Actual System)

```mermaid
%%{init: {'theme':'forest'}}%%
flowchart TD
    Start([Event Triggers]) --> Load[Load Rules by Position]
    Load --> Rule1{Rule 1 Met?}
    
    Rule1 -->|Yes| Op1{Next Rule Logic?}
    Rule1 -->|No| Op1
    
    Op1 -->|AND| Rule2AND{Rule 2 Met?}
    Op1 -->|OR| Rule2OR{Rule 2 Met?}
    
    Rule2AND -->|Yes + Prev Yes| Actions[Execute Actions]
    Rule2AND -->|No| Skip[Skip Actions]
    
    Rule2OR -->|Yes| Actions
    Rule2OR -->|No + Prev No| Skip
    
    Actions --> Log[Log Execution]
    Skip --> Log
    
    style Start fill:#E8F4FF
    style Actions fill:#D4EDDA
    style Skip fill:#FFF3CD
```

###### Webhook with Retry Logic

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant T as Tallyfy
    participant Q as Queue
    participant E as External System
    
    T->>Q: Queue webhook event
    Q->>E: POST webhook_url
    
    alt Success (2xx)
        E-->>Q: Success
        Q->>T: Mark delivered
    else Failure
        E-->>Q: Error/Timeout
        loop Retry 3 times
            Q->>Q: Wait (1min, 5min, 15min)
            Q->>E: POST webhook_url
            alt Success
                E-->>Q: Success
                Q->>T: Mark delivered
            end
        end
    end
```

###### SSO Setup (User + Admin Collaboration)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Admin
    participant T as Tallyfy
    participant I as Identity Provider
    participant U as User
    
    Note over A,I: Setup Phase
    A->>T: Configure SSO
    T->>I: Register SP
    I-->>T: Metadata
    T-->>A: Ready
    
    Note over U,I: Login Phase
    U->>T: Access Tallyfy
    T->>I: Redirect to IdP
    U->>I: Credentials
    I->>T: SAML assertion
    T-->>U: Access granted
```

##### Terminology Guidelines

**For API/Technical Docs** - Use technical terms:
- `POST /api/v1/processes`
- `Bearer token`
- `HTTP 201 Created`
- `webhook_url`
- Database field names

**For User-Facing Docs** - Use business terms:
- "Launch a process"
- "Complete a task"
- "Assign to team"
- "Automation triggers"
- UI labels and button names

##### Best Practices

1. **Keep diagrams focused** - One concept per diagram
2. **Use consistent styling**:
   - Start nodes: `fill:#E8F4FF`
   - Success: `fill:#D4EDDA`
   - Error: `fill:#F8D7DA`
   - Warning/Skip: `fill:#FFF3CD`
3. **Mobile-friendly** - Test readability on small screens
4. **Add context** - Include descriptive text before/after diagrams
5. **Match audience** - API terms for developers, business terms for users
6. **Show error paths** - Include failure scenarios and retry logic

For comprehensive Mermaid documentation, see the [Mermaid Official Docs](https://mermaid.js.org/) or test your diagrams in the [Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid.live/).
