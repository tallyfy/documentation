<END_OF_ENTRY_DELIMITER>
### Constant Probability Sampling
An event sampling method where each event has a fixed and predetermined probability of being selected and processed. This strategy, also known as Fixed-Rate Sampling, involves defining a constant rate (e.g., 1 in every 100 events) for including events, making it simple to implement but potentially risking the loss of rare critical events if the rate is too low.
See also:
- [Effective event sampling strategies](/products/manufactory/best-practices/event-sampling-strategies/)
<END_OF_ENTRY_DELIMITER>
### Content-Based Sampling
An event sampling strategy where the decision to sample an event is based on the values of its attributes or content. This method, also known as Per-Key Sampling, allows for defining different sampling rates for events with specific characteristics (e.g., always keeping critical error events while sampling routine informational events at a lower rate), ensuring important data is captured.
See also:
- [Effective event sampling strategies](/products/manufactory/best-practices/event-sampling-strategies/)
<END_OF_ENTRY_DELIMITER>
### Context Propagation (Distributed Tracing)
In distributed tracing, context propagation is the mechanism for carrying trace identifiers (like Trace ID and Parent Span ID) and other relevant trace data (e.g., sampling decisions) across service boundaries as a request or event flows through multiple components of a system. This ensures that all operations related to the initial event can be linked together in a single, coherent trace, which is essential for end-to-end visibility in systems like Tallyfy Manufactory.

### Core Analysis Loop
An iterative, systematic method for analyzing event data to derive insights, particularly useful for investigating issues in event-driven systems like those managed by Tallyfy Manufactory. The loop consists of four main phases: Observe (identify an issue or question), Orient (formulate a hypothesis), Decide & Act (test the hypothesis by querying and filtering data), and Learn & Iterate (examine results and refine the inquiry).

### Correlation Identifier
An identifier included in event data that links multiple, distinct events to a single, overarching business transaction or workflow instance. This allows systems like Tallyfy Manufactory and observability tools to trace and analyze all related events within a complex process, even if they are processed by different services or occur at different times. Examples include an `order_id` or a `workflow_id`.

### Error Budget
In the context of Service Level Objectives (SLOs), an Error Budget represents the acceptable level of unreliability or failure for a service over a defined period. It is calculated as 100% minus the SLO target (e.g., an SLO of 99.9% reliability yields a 0.1% error budget). Monitoring the consumption of this budget helps teams balance reliability work with feature development.

<END_OF_ENTRY_DELIMITER>
### Error Budget Burn Rate
A measure of how quickly a service is consuming its allowed Error Budget. A high burn rate indicates that the service is experiencing failures or unreliability at a pace that will likely cause it to breach its Service Level Objective (SLO) if not addressed. Alerts are often set on the burn rate to proactively manage service reliability.
